The black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are starting to see the solution in a small black box that easily fits into your car’s dashboard.
Devices that track every mile a motorist walks and pass this information on to authorities are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and state planning authorities to rebuild America’s outdated system of financing major roads.
Usually, the tedious design of motorways suddenly sparked an intense debate and the formation of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these tiny lockers to record miles travelled and perhaps even where you were going – and then use this information to build a tax return.
The tea party is terrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy concerns.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to proceed, some states are not expecting anything.
They explore how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for a kilometer of the road he is driving on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It’s not a matter of choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to start tracking every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This is what this technology is for.
The impetus is the fact that the Road Trust Fund, financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as before.
Cars can travel many more miles per gallon.
The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has not increased in the last 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a single cent.
“A gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this per-kilometre payment system.
"In the long run, this seems like the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometers travelled.
It’s no surprise that urban liberals like the idea, because taxes can be used to change driver behavior patterns, which can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Californian planners look to this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Reason Foundation’s free market leaders are also in favor of drivers paying for mileage.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards paying per kilometer.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would involve about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal, due to concerns from rural lawmakers representing parts of the population, whose daily life often means walking many miles to work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are still making progress on their own.
The most zealous is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a mileage tax instead of a gasoline tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is exploring the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent on trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport ministries, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement the change.
However, this concept does not only have supporters.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
“Worrying about Big Brother tracking and similar issues was a big issue,” said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.”
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably expand to record the daily trips and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find affordable technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers the car travels, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be more calm.
The pursuit of such technology led some state agencies to a small California company called True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not involved in the action to assist the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging market for legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they drove.
But this device, which it tests, attracts the attention of road network designers, because it does not use GPS and delivers only a limited amount of information, which is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go if you don’t track their speed and their location,” says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have occurred in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accept this concept if the device is able to do more, not less.
In the city of New York, traffic officials are trying to develop a taxation device that would be equipped to pay extra parking hours, to provide mileage insurance, and to collect data on other drivers’ speed so that motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motors will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” the city’s projection document said.
However, some transport planners would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometer are not just a huge proxy problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Committee in the San Francisco Bay Area say Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the tax on gasoline.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when you have enough aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka is negotiating for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
Social-democracy is crumbling, folks and grandparents are talking to each other and preparing for a joint action.
If the Social Democrats wake up within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly aligned partners who will put on the table a ready list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The envoys of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to the volatile minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka came across for the first time after four days on the wave of sympathy.
Yesterday he failed to control the political bureau and, above all, to force the convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is only him, the other team members will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologised to the members of the Bureau and now to the citizens.
You shouldn't lie, in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the closest leader of Social Democracy, after the meeting.
He added that he did not hold the position of First Vice-President.
"I will announce my decision on November 10th at the <0xC3><0x9A>VS," Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD Vice-President Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>kromach and the head of the parliamentary club Jeron<0xC3><0xBD>m Tejc also spoke.
He said he was elected just two days ago.
The two deputies then declared that they would do everything to ensure that the fifty-member <0xC4><0x8C>SSD club would speak with one voice.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek put the crown on the absurd theatre by saying: "I have been a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and respected the decisions of the party bodies."
Another lie in a live broadcast.
Or did he forget, when calling for Sobotka’s resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, that August’s Central Committee with 57 percent decided that Bohuslav Sobotka is the party’s candidate for prime minister?
However, the head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, by convening the Central Election Committee, made a powerful army of enemies until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a variety of gossip and rumors, possibly reminding of the real mistakes of Sobotka’s political career.
The dirty laundry will be heavily laundered, there will be signs of dark alliances between coal baron Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala and Sobotka’s wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> will be discussed.
Disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization <0xC4><0x8C>SSD are erupting.
Peter Kajnar, the mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka’s ally, said: “I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots.”
If the CCA had already met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The traitors will sprinkle their heads with ashes and stay.
And at the moment, the winner of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will end with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on the problems with the Olympic Games in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he just exhales deeply: "It's difficult."
Cooperation with the organizing team of the 2014 Sochi Olympics is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same way," said the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work more slowly and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of providing information on essential matters not so much.
Perhaps we have been enjoying them for three months now, so that they can give us the official designation of each village, so that we can do a lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
They are still communicating on many things.
Is the Olympic Village finished yet?
But it is no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago, we walked through empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What do you mean they are empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just the basic concrete, so that was the situation a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26 as a vanguard, it will still smell glue.
And if they don't, what's going to happen?
Do you think President Putin would send an army there?
That's exactly how it's gonna turn out.
Just so it's not that Olympic Village = Potemkin Village.
Rather, they run the risk of not having time to adjust the routes, for example, they do not finish the details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a state that we'll have to take our London Olympics shoes with us.
But I'm sure they'll get it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although depending on the nomination criteria, this number changes.
Maybe the figure skaters will ride in the three of them that rode out.
There is no doubt about the speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Do you still have a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should be flying there until January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things on the subway so that we didn’t just trust the sketches.
There are a lot of other things we do, including transportation.
And what does the Chief of Mission do 100 days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am doing the usual agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin Promises Ecological Olympics, Plan to Stop Giant Secret Landfills
Fans of winter sports are already cutting the meter to the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking at their preparation with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, which will only begin in February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be failing to keep their promise that the preparations and holding of the Games will not in the least disturb nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high ranking, and the Canadian Games have been listed as the most environmentally friendly games in the history of the Olympics.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "zero waste" has long since taken over.
Last week, AP reporters discovered a giant landfill of building materials in the village of Achstyr near Sochi.
A landfill full of building materials, tyres, canisters and insulating foams was found in August, which environmentalists immediately reported.
The Russian authorities slammed and the landfill disappeared.
But only for a while.
Last week, reporters got a glimpse of a landfill the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, there are several in the area of such places, the British newspaper The Times described.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly, is building a 60-kilometer-long road between Sochi airport and the sports resort.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railroads argued that the landfill had been set up by a subcontractor.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the residents of Akhshtyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months now, day and night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymtu, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
“The water from here will contaminate So<0xC4><0x8D>a’s water springs for the next 10 to 15 years,” Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental nonprofit EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
For comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics will cost $43 billion.
Last year’s games in London cost only $19 billion, and the Vancouver games cost $9 billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will eventually be enough snow, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working on the exhibition of sports venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers closed his mouth to protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers will cope with the new law, which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality, during the games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple has matured to live with their parents, the new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the plot itself somewhat sloping.
The requirement also stated that two generations would live in the house, who would like to live together, but at the same time each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
“In creating the design, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place.”
“The three different functions of the house are connected through several paths through the exterior of the building, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their own privacy,” the designers explain.
The home of the parents is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are tied.
Individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in different finishing of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been shaped using board panels, the part where the office is is plastered white, and the remaining elements remained in a pure concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very intertwined with the exterior.
The home of the parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance for the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall, and from there they climb the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their construction allows a lot of natural light to cascade through them.
This is what the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique on it.
The household of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with a sliding door.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and then climbs up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on open letters to students, educators and the leadership of secondary and higher education institutions in several regions to defend academic freedoms against the election campaign conducted by President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman in schools.
I have had more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who rejected the lecture of the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received retaliation in the form of not being invited to the celebration of the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were not so brave and made the visit of Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman possible: University of Technology in Brno, Gymnasium Hladnov in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> University in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of the promotion of policy in universities.
The newly elected deputy for the ODS, the dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic post and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
This is not the same as being the mayor of a small town.
Do you want to join the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD heads, who are forging the position of deputy and hejtman at the same time and, like them, degrade both professions?
This is because you are telling people that you can handle both of these challenging functions of the left back.
I know, we have the example of Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, who manages even several dozen functions at once.
This is not an example of a person you should follow.
We can also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Fra<0xC5><0x88>ková, who preferred to leave her parliamentary post in order to be fully dedicated to the management of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to leave the office of Dean, however, is that you will violate the apolitical nature of the academic ground of the University of Pardubice.
The leadership of the Pardubice ODS sees your current work in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help your "school" without becoming a dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion as I have with Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and save your face.
Otherwise, voters may be able to count you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice bubbles cabbage, chemistry is not added to it
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut will be produced in the coming months in Slovenská Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season started here in October and will last about six months.
Healthy delicacy has been produced here since 1925 in a still traditional way, i.e. by treading directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, this is a rarity.
Our employees will find a route of almost ten kilometers for the shift.
Each of the ten tanks will fit fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts, "said the director of the plant Slovácká Fruta David Kladroba.
Heads of cabbage are transported to the company's premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostro<0xC5><0xBE>sko and B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsko.
Fruta’s employees then clean the vegetables, remove the broomsticks and throw them into the roller.
From there, already chopped cabbage falls into pools six meters deep, in which tirelessly work treadmills dressed in white clothes and leggings.
This displaces unwanted air.
The last trampled layer of cabbage is covered with a sheet and loaded with water.
"The cabbage cake then ripens for six to eight weeks under spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation-enhancing substances," said the director of Kladrob.
The natural process corresponds to production in home conditions, individual layers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
After fermentation, the cabbage goes to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet-acid infusion into bags or glasses and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
Interest in it is also registered in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden willing to ‘cooperate’ with Germany over U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence snitch, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: “Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as fugitives and seeks to criminalize political speech with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defense.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed support from the international community could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online magazine: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
Tensions between the U.S. and Germany began to rise after allegations emerged that the NSA was tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel overseeing the news, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and destroying relations with the US completely,” it should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on Twitter.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he ever left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, a member of parliament said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
But he said the world’s reaction to his “act of political expression” had given him courage.
Citizens around the world and senior officials – including those in the United States – have assessed the uncovering of an unjustified system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
We are sorry to kill, but we are innocent, the representatives of the Khmer Rouge defend
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism from 1975 to 1979, more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population, were killed by exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution.
The commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had no idea what the real extent of the killings were.
“It’s easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything, and therefore intervened and corrected the situation,” Samphan told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I had no authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadres "to mistreat or kill people, deny them food or commit genocide".
But he acknowledged "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to the entire Cambodian people," he said.
The 55-year-old bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Che’s apology.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"He doesn't care about the others," she said.
"If he had not given orders, his subordinates would not have killed," she added, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters."
Foreign Minister Ieng Sara of the Khmer Rouge regime, who died in March, was also due to stand trial.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incompetent in September 2012 due to dementia.
The Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines to Charge Hand Baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for hand luggage on board on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in an announcement Wednesday, they said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand baggage fee applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so small baggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers with the payment wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the 100-dollar fee is intended to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge that fee," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed into hand luggage hidden in the storage area as much as they could, so there was often no space in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee is really not to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can bring baggage for which they pay nothing, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same baggage.
O’Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure passengers are aware of the charge before they arrive at the gate.
The new Frontier hand baggage fee will not be in force until the summer, but a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
He argues that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the extra baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover air traffic costs after years of losses.
Most of them did not pay for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, followed suit later.
The only company that also has such fees is Wizz Air in Hungary, says aviation consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand baggage fee would bring in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and marveled at what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered Spirit’s unusual hand luggage fee.
“Getting on a plane was the smoothest thing I’ve ever seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and quarrels at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and boarding took place in a blink of an eye."
Similar to Spirit, Frontier will also charge fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and coffee will be refilled for free.
Water will continue to be provided free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to introduce drinks charges in 2008, but after complaints from passengers seven months later it withdrew and no other major airline imitated it.
Frontier’s last move to charge hand baggage, if a passenger does not buy a flight directly from this airline, is its latest effort to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors, such as Orbitz, between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier went the farthest in this area.
In September, it began giving customers who purchased through an online travel agency only half of the miles as part of the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she slashed the miles bounty to 25 percent of the journey.
So a 1000-mile Frontier trip purchased through an online travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to pre-select their seat only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and lose money.
According to the financial results announced on Wednesday by Republic Airways Holdings, the company’s partner, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
With the sale of the airline, Republic is also trying to solve Frontier’s financial problems.
NSA not blaming hackers for website crash, but ‘internal error’
The secretive National Security Agency said last Friday that its website crashed for several hours last week because of an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update,” the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server scanners noted that the NSA’s website had been down for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were not “at all” compromised.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for shutting down NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood target websites with information until the servers are overwhelmed and the page crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has in recent months become the focus of public attention and the target of biting criticism after the revelation of foreign and domestic surveillance programs, the product of the theft of secret NSA files from the agency and their disclosure by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has prompted earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profit fell due to drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information on whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the launch test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is proceeding well.
The results did not meet the estimates and shares on the stock exchange in Toronto fell by 8 percent.
State-owned bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded the rating from “higher yield” to “sector performance” on Thursday, expecting the exchange to experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While we generally expected smaller aircraft deliveries, the profit margin in the transport sector disappointed us greatly,” Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that market skepticism towards this program will increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will penetrate the lower market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders of CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers wait for the results of a test flight to verify the company’s claims of low consumption and cost savings on this passenger aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
Leaders also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans it differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and that’s what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is scheduled to take off in the coming weeks and the rest shortly thereafter.
Analysts are still skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – although in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share in the third quarter ended September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’ IBES system, analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter compared to 57 the year before.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of September 30, which remains unchanged as of December 31.
“The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low order intake and overall market condition disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said revenue in the division grew nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled orders in transport amounted to 32.6 billion as of 30 September, which is a marginal increase compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Executives said new outlooks will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent during Thursday afternoon trading to $4.83.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned mobster about police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to pass information to the underworld king Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed a drug mobster about a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was accused of being a cocaine addict and was accused of passing sensitive information to the head of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough, about the investigation into his drug-related activities.
The lawyer, nicknamed “Bash” and hailed by criminals as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 following police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous narcotics cases.
Officers saw Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at his lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was having dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular class A drug user.
Over a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he sought information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were under investigation at the time as part of a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police seized some <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine along with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids, 32 other people were imprisoned along with them.
Ditta, 42, handed out information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be discovered.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors, a Blackburn-based law firm, experienced a shameful moment before Liverpool’s Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
At an earlier hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's fall came after a Scarborough police investigation found he had regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditto's house, and saw him place drugs with a purity of 60 percent under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough and Ditta, who were having dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, were in regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home, where he found the drugs, and nine interviews took place between the two people.
The court heard that there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, saying he spoke to the suspected drug dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell into “confidential communication.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards from it, but all were seized and hair samples taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated an office both at his home address and at his workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware of the fact that he must not break the law than a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a solicitor and of getting too close to a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here isn't just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond a normal lawyer-client relationship.
He thwarted police investigations as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring his profession a good reputation, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He got too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta denied the offense, saying, “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to give Mr. Scarborough information, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
Police Inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta turned from a criminal lawyer himself to a criminal when he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organized crime groups, who gave him the task of collecting valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and must inspire confidence and confidence in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr Ditto, on which he was also convicted of three cases of possession of cocaine and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you before our courts.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other traffickers have been jailed for 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta hosted an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row in America, as a dinner guest he would like Mohammed Ali, and as a motivation for work he cited inequality.
He negotiated government with Klaus and <0xC5><0xA0>pidla.
Now the People's Party sent Jan Kasal against Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The People's Party won fourteen seats in the elections, which is only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of the ANO.
But they enter government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already started arguing the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who adjusted the conditions of government participation during the People's Party in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> have such a matador on their side.
This time it will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates, as this year's talks will unfold.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
“It is a frightening news and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the newspaper said, deeming the bill unconstitutional.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is the extended arm of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to MPs," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively gives the government “full control over the media” and the Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “have taken a hard hit” and criticizes the bill as “strict”.
The adoption of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media turned their anger on themselves when they broadcast footage of a security camera on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbed a luxury store.
The police chief responded by summoning two journalists and a leading media worker for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of being “removed from the list” or denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single fine is enough to wipe out most radio stations.”
It also states that these measures may have a liquidating effect on what is called Kenya’s “living blogosphere.”
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do what they want with impunity.
“You never know what might happen,” Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish cuts ordered by the national payroll agency and to restore their fat salaries of around 532,000 tax-free shillings a month, which ranks among the highest in the world.
We need to save money, young Czechs know.
Most of them don’t even know what interest rate they are.
More and more Czechs are putting money aside.
However, they do not reach the champions in savings in the region.
Austrians save the most money on the side, saving an average of 181 euros per month.
A little more than the Czechs will save even people in Slovakia.
This is according to a survey by Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern European countries.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, and two-thirds of the respondents plan to put more money aside.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia, people who save products still use very little.
For example, almost every second Serb saves at home "under the pillow", according to a survey.
This year, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased.
Just last year, 26 percent of respondents put a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns each month for various types of savings, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly deposit fell slightly to CZK 2078 in the year-on-year comparison.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension supplementary insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, and interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to last year.
Only 16% of respondents use them, compared to almost a quarter last year.
The survey also showed that while people find it important to save money, most of them do not know what returns they make on individual products.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is being paid.
On the other hand, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their saved money, among people over fifty years of age, 73% of those surveyed know this.
In the international comparison, Erste Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12% margin.
UN celebrates new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work urgently on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said overnight at the summit that now was the time to “raise above national interests”.
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the SDGs,” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the MDGs and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique security concerns escalate due to conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, Mozambique’s founding president, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to shout peace slogans for a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she swapped corporate clothes for a T-shirt adorned with the words “we want safety” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and the Renamo party, some of the worst skirmishes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago, were reported.
Renamo was once a notorious insurgent movement, initially supported by the White government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that open conflict is unlikely to re-erupt in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
A rapidly growing economy is at stake as discoveries of large offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring more than $50 billion in investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale in Brazil, Eni in Italy, and Anadarko in the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the government sparked recent conflicts by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo Party stronghold, on September 17.
The violent assault on former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked Renamo’s base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, party spokesman Renamo Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the conflicts, saying he was attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to alleviate concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP news agency on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "anything left of his power to try to prove that he can order the government to make its own decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns grew when Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr. Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions between the parties, fuelled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It is a quarrel between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Open University lecturer and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has pushed for electoral change, has already said it would boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a dying movement to gain benefits and financial gain from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo's party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza - whose second term is coming to an end next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democratic system, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to let go of the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but it has carried out subversive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south road.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers away from the capital, Maputo, but where the city of Beira is, a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely for their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended rail traffic for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also worried about corruption, slow development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Protester Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
Stories about Thor can show that "brute force cannot equal clever cunning", while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Much of the myth would be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach in school,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates for a careful selection of works appropriate to the age.
“I think it’s great that myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have defended this plan for twenty years.
He added that "openly instructive" authors and teachers are a "switch" for engaging stories with a "subliminal" message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Tales, says: “You may have good intentions, but you will do better to keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end in a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly stated.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
Brno observatory will take visitors to space in a new digital
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the large planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can plunge into the new comfortable seats and over their heads added a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are placed in the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"These are twenty-one computers that generate images," said the director of the Brno observatory, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a coherent impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of conventional personal computers," said the technician from the observatory Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hladík.
Digitalium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
In this way, the viewers find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is nearest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to screen the purchased programs and their own creations in the hall.
There are two programs on the agenda from Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about training astronauts, fly into space, turn on a centrifuge, and then see the difficult conditions astronauts face in space.
The second program is for children and is called The Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a reef whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the eruption of a nearby volcano.
The entire digitary cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector 12 million.
"The rest was swallowed up by audiovisual technology and computers," Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
The installation of the digitary followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to director Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, there could still be 25,000 to 30,000 visitors by the end of the year.
We have studied 11,000 insertions!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job advertisements, of which 4,300 were published in the daily newspaper and 6,800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
Thus, the Internet becomes the most important medium for posting job offers.
Back in 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) it stabilized at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, advertising of job opportunities in itself largely reflects the current situation on the labor market.
An example is a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published in the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25 900 ads were published in the same period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>stnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies from media to media.
On the Internet, the leading places were occupied by advertisements looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or small business leaders was only featured on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, a large representation belongs mainly to the service and labor professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through advertising.
Other areas studied included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent of ads, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only two percent of ads, employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for "computer literacy" appeared in 40 percent of ads (in the daily press in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of ads.
Practical requirements are generally associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
Workers' professions are mainly mechanics and repairers or producers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, the author of the study, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Tillner, added.
Employers also state the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates in half of their ads.
As the most often required skills in advertising, communication skills have long been emerging in the first place.
Employers also demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the place where America’s solo comic performance was born: almost a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes to the gathered people by the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the solo comedy institution Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these titles have appeared in the Carolinas and have become so successful that they are too big to play at the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musical comedy benefit show at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose up with his sitcom (the cheerfully spicy “League” on a fantasy-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, but she was best known for the fast-moving series of Marcel the shell with shoes on.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the sarcastic, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are a product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down an alley between two buildings and thinks, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil has fallen to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high stocks were counterbalanced by a report that showed China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector was strengthening.
The U.S. oil index for December deliveries during the late morning fell in European e-commerce on the New York trading exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents and for the month of October fell by 5.8 percent.
Over the past few weeks, oil reserves have weighed heavily on the price.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stockpiles had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese manufacturing gave rise to higher demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Brent crude, an international oil indicator also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the International Trade Exchange in London.
No, Mr. Haskell.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to put such pressure on Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek to be deprived of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will lower the level of political culture, which is already so fading.
Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is shielded by the promise he made, but everyone and the politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of this promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr Babi<0xC5><0xA1> also has the material capital, but the question is whether he is a politician).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn’t apologize in politics, he retreats in politics.
Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, so if you did not lie - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakling whose words or actions cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, even a mistaken person, or a lifelong skete.
It may seem unfair to you that I speak only to you, but you are the leader, and they are the wrong sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you're trying to bow your ears for a while, regroup your forces, sit the shame down and then attack again, but that's how guerrillas or traitors behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, the alpha male, so act like it.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the regulation on the procedure of arrest and search of persons by the police department in NY
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order demanding changes to the arrest and search program at the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
A second U.S. federal appeals court said the decision by Judge Shira Scheindlin would be postponed until the city's appeals decision.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by carrying out its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city challenged its conclusions and its corrective decrees, including the decision to assign supervision to help the police department change its procedures and its associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the postponement on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge must be dismissed because she came into conflict with the judges' rules of conduct by not acting as a judge to avoid appearing biased, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement that she openly responded to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unfairly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their stop and search program.
It has established independent oversight to oversee major changes including reforms in procedures, training and oversight, and has ordered the launch of a pilot program to test body-wearing cameras in some areas where people are being stopped most often.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police search.
An oral justification for the city’s appeal is scheduled sometime after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching persons have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there have been stops and searches for about a decade, but the recorded searches under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, filed a lawsuit, which became a case of a group lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s stoppage and search program say the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how these practices are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the change will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but it will not solve the broader problem when the police force is under pressure after its numbers fell by several thousand people over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching persons, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NY police department introduced searches.
One-fifth of shopping malls face low traffic
This is according to real estate advisory firms Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Kraków Shopping Centre opens to the public in Bohnice, Prague, and will be the 19th shopping centre in Prague.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are the inadequately large center to the location and the poor layout, i.e. too many floors or complicated and inaccurate arrangement of passages, or the dead places of the centers, "said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Sylvie Samadi, head of retail real estate at Jones Lang LaSalle, about a fifth of shopping centers are struggling with low traffic.
The main reasons are, among others, poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or market overcrowding in a given place.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mostly unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centers need to do more to ‘entice’ their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” Samadi added.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centers is generally stable, even in some centers is rising, because the landlords were willing in the crisis to discount the rent and rent some units.
"However, it is true that some projects have recently opened that are not fully occupied and reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, <0xC5><0xA0>antovka in Olomouc)," added Soták.
According to Sylvia Samadi, the shopping malls opened in the past two years are moving very slowly on the market.
There is a market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', focused on shopping and services of daily necessities for the population living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.
Also, according to Soták, there is a place on the domestic market for other shopping centers.
This is for both small 'service' centers and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, he sees the space for the upcoming shopping center on Vít<0xC4><0x9B>zné nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí (Vít<0xC4><0x9B>zné nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí), and according to him, the streets Na P<0xC5><0x99>íkop<0xC4><0x9B> and Václavské nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí (Wenceslas Square) have a clear potential.
"The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, which allow retailers to cover and expand to increasingly smaller cities for favorable rental and operating costs, space is also available in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," added DZán Kubková.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centers in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leasable space.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In terms of the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic is lagging behind by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check the tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson reportedly used methods of “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to confirm a fraudulent tip about a love affair involving then-Interior Secretary Charles Clarke.
Attorney General Andrew Edis at Old Bailey Court said News of the World caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson had also called her and left her voicemails.
“The Attorney General suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not a man standing outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but a man who likes to tell people stories to see what they have to say,” Mr. Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways of exploring stories: hacking the phone, watching, and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the other, the surveillance, he must know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking his phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
Rumors of a love affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW Newspaper's reporting department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, "You're just wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator’s computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as “Projects.”
While Ms. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief correspondent Neville Thurlbeck and former correspondent James Weatherup oversaw Mrs. Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left a voicemail saying, "I've got a story we're going to publish tomorrow that I'd love to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis says Coulson’s involvement in the story follows the same pattern as other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The court heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over his love affair with a married woman while he was seeing co-accused Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied any conspiracy to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck, and Weatherup all confessed to hacking into their phones.
NSA Exposure Increases Social Paranoia of State Watch
One quiet day at the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. consular post in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany’s national intelligence agency, the mission aimed to take pictures of the roof of the American forward patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and the action triggered an exchange of views in Berlin between the US and German foreign ministers.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who has become a whistleblower, began uncovering his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading businessmen no longer know whether to trust the director’s words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia about state surveillance reached new dimensions.
The last straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been wiretapped for perhaps a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be the target, then the leading entrepreneurs are certainly the potential targets.
Snowden has made it clear that there is intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I would say that it is possible that this data is used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by EY’s consulting service, German companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as big a risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in the entire documentation uncovered by Mr Snowden that the United States has passed on trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and said it should try to reduce its dependence on the US:
Business leaders are skeptical of this.
The German parliament is calling for the creation of a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not the way to go, says Hasso Plattner, president of German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical sophistication of the U.S. espionage agencies exposed by Snowden is shocking to some companies who have so far believed China to be the biggest threat from surveillance.
A major shift is taking place in cloud computing, where European officials have broadly realized that data stored in the US falls under U.S. jurisdiction and is therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the U.S. Prism data mining program was unveiled.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, said: “We have this new question for customers who weren’t here a year ago – where is my data stored and can you guarantee it will physically stay in this jurisdiction?”
Many senior German officials argue that the latest news is just a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
“This has been a major issue for many years and has not changed significantly even during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of agrochemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Generally, business leaders do not want to boast about the countermeasures they have taken in order not to give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German BfV is advising executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones abroad because of the risk of embezzlement of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, there is a concern that SMEs will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their specific fields.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access,” the BfV warned in its report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February listed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row of offenders involved in hacking activities for economic news outlets, just behind China.
A board member in a German risk-free society concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France’s internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of Georgian Teenage Boy Who Died in Strange Accident Believe He Was Murdered
PARIS (Reuters) - The parents of a Georgia minor whose body was found inside a wrestling ghost in the gym of his high school believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found stranded behind the stands in the gymnasium of his high school on January 11.
The sheriff’s investigators from Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the 17-year-old’s family refused.
“They are firmly convinced that their son was murdered,” lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told Fox News.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff had said.
"They believe it goes against logic, physical laws, and common sense," Crump said.
They believe this is to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school as usual, and he came back to them in a body bag," he said.
Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
said Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation.”
The second autopsy, however, said Moore gave a different cause of death.
"There are several questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovered enough evidence in the case of Johnson’s death to warrant an investigation into a crime or civil rights violation, he would ask the FBI to execute it.
The deputy of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for any comment on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia ordered authorities on Wednesday to make available all surveillance footage that investigators had viewed.
The teenager’s parents hope that the videos will contain a clue leading to the revelation of how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the U.S. government, due to the increasing number of school-age children suffering from food allergies.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children’s food allergies and how to react to an allergic reaction, if any.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline available – most often an EpiPen automatic injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislators have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms appearing in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say, “It’s like someone’s stabbed my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “I have itchy tongue.”
Parents of intersex children can choose "uncertain sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with an ambiguous sexual system.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to list any gender for such children, and allows them to list gender on their birth certificates as “indeterminate” or “unspecified”.
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to make a hasty decision on their child’s sex-determining surgery, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years: “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll remain a doctor-created brew, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year one of 2,000 babies is born that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual developmental disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Determining gender is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is impossible to determine gender, it is better to use the best available information and determine it, rather than waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender problems, said the new German law “seems like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not," he said.
Determining the sex can be done without surgery, and then you can wait as the identity develops.
Knowing how a child will develop sexual affiliation is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These features may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sex organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys of no gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to identify male, female or “third gender” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first recognized “genderless” person in June when she won a court appeal to retain her “indeterminate” gender status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have a third designation, X, in addition to M (male) and F (female), for intersex people.
In neighbouring France, the gender issue is still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The Catholic online website also delineated itself against German law, writing: “As the world is drawn to a new state where gender is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are overturning two other pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn from Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would rather see babies be assigned sex at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful without any other restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, after the handsome Greek who had a double sex.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that gender was like a board that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, saying that gender is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
A persistent theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genders was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender is docile.
He created a new concept of “gender” and argued that social causes and environmental influences – how parents raised their child – influenced children’s genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as “John/Joan,” his theory became questionable.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged by poor circumcision to have his child castrated completely, his testicles removed and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had surgery back on the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations emerged “dissatisfied with the result.”
It was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sexual system.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life.”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from his external organs and testicles and raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent for vaginal surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
After I was born, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender developmental disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its sexual system.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took testosterone doses and had his bust removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today, she represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and seeks to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “calls for stamping and stigma.”
“Many activists fear that the German law will achieve encouraging parents to make quick decisions and choose ‘uncertain’ for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it'll encourage intervention.
We believe that it is better to allocate male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will sound in the end, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be placed in the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legally valid sex,” she said.
German law is going to allocate it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not be seduced at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist in Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual developmental disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said German law would “grant powers” to both parents and children.
Baratzo's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie has developed feminine traits.
He's got a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and working as an intern in child psychiatry as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some space to make their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and think about it, and it gives them time before they write “man” or “woman.”
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy about it.
You do not need to rush to an operation that is irreversible.
“It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and takes away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
Eventually, the child decides which gender he or she identifies with more – and that’s a great thing.
This gives children the power to make their own decisions.
Drunken man spills gasoline on house: Threatens to set it on fire with family
The tension increased, the fear intensified.
The man threatened to burn down the whole house.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of a corps of volunteer firefighters, went to the place.
A police negotiator also arrived at the scene, trying to dissuade the man from his irrational behavior.
The man threatened to burn down the house.
So the house had to be invaded by the task force, which neutralized the man and handcuffed him.
The aggressor then ended up for examination in a hospital in Mladá Boleslav, from where he was transferred to an anti-alcohol arrest station.
Eventually, the firefighters covered the house with gasoline with sorbent, which was later cleaned.
In addition to people, all pets were rescued from the house.
The man did not give up on the police negotiator, so the squad went to him.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest adviser, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton in 2012.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times magazine received a copy of the incoming book and announced on Thursday night that the president’s top aides were holding intensive group meetings and polls in late 2011 to assess whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama’s fading hopes of re-election.
According to a national-political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and at the White House, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the election of former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice President.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Few of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew the change was under consideration.
The book "Double Down" claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they eventually decided not to make the move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the nominee would "not substantially increase Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've been doing a lot of research, and this was one of them," he told Daley.
You must remember that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we were like, ‘Oh, my God, what are we supposed to do?’
While Daley characterized the research as “appropriate care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the campaign for re-election had made considerable investments to see if the move in the election would pay off.
“Campaigns don’t spend that kind of money on elections and qualitative research unless something is seriously considered,” Martin told AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama was aware that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then-boss was aware of this potential card mixing.
While Daley said he did not think the president was "aware" of the potential change, the former head of the office admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitively does not answer the question of whether the political probe got to Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn’t know about the research to remove Biden from the candidate.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has made the first ice cream that glows in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea after reading an expert treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically manufacture the protein that causes luminescence.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s tongue – it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says ice cream glows when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, so the more you lick it, the brighter it glows.
Charlie, founder of ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious", says: "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you get about 2 grams of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream begins to shine.
We’ve tested it over the last few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because jellyfish glowing is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each hill costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes good.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unconventional flavours of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product will be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, this is impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I'm counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up late and show off to the neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a covetous man.
For two years, no candy appeared in my apartment, and this year it will probably not be any different.
However, statistics show that, when it comes to Halloween, I am a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year, most Americans will celebrate Halloween — in fact, 158 million of them — and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and ornaments.
But what I always look forward to on Halloween is trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year’s latest fashion stunt is sexy inanimate objects.
It doesn’t have to be just women anymore; it can also be food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect we will see a lot of zombies through the parade of the dead, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following the tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my amazement, we weren’t the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
So you'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers sweets, and Clark sticks.
That's amazing news for the 41 million carolists who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to raid our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, believe it or not, 45 million kilograms of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want is corn candies, and yet, according to the National Candy Association, nearly 16,000 tons of them are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never solved.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best titles like “Terror Behind the Walls” and “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, in the United States, there are officially dedicated 1,200 haunted houses that, according to the American Haunted Houses Company, make a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos that you are pissed fears and your friend puts on Facebook, and you can't delete them, and the person you like will look at the photo and write a comment like "beautiful."
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
Even when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we’ve been doing it since we were little.
Luckily for us, the “child in the pumpkin” trend started with the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up carving a pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with the flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245 thousand tons of pumpkins have grown this year.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting their nearly one-ton pumpkin.
Announced series of racing Land Rover
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercommunication devices.
You can choose from improved brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between races.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The racers who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, and also a reachable path to world-class racing.
We are delighted to offer this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it’s going to be an exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
TOP 09 chairman Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the latter, in an interview with Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, he said that there is no other way out, and every government that emerged from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blindfold.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, who estimates the term of office to be two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly make a completely different choice next time, he disagrees: "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the chairman of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next elections as this year (in comparison with 2010 it lost about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was clear that there would be early elections within two months, it would strengthen Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s ANO 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will lose.
The turbulent situation in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, where the chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the party leadership, said that either he or Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg in his own way:
"Leading officials of the Democratic Party like little boys go to the head of state to allow them a coup in the party."
"I thought Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I've never seen anything so impatiently poorly done in my life," added the TOP 09 chairman.
And to President Zeman (whom he met in the fight for the presidency) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to seize the party."
The first TOP 09 laws have already been tabled.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws to the House, including the Faroese Register of Treaties, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
The president of TOP 09 in an interview with Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz says that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, however, the TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement, Martin Komárek, accused the TOP 09 in the pre-election fight of "stealing" the ANO movement's program with the idea of introducing a register of contracts.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage - it simply dusted off a proposal that had already made its way into the second reading of the House.
Firefighters came to rescue a lost puppy that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was seen trapped in a quarry by a man walking a dog.
Firefighters climbed the rock to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by fire brigades who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days alone until he was rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After escaping, when he got into a small accident, they feverishly searched for his lost dog and posted challenges on social networks.
At about 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a keen-sighted dogman saw Ruby stranded on a protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and descended to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up on the rock.
Andy Clayton, expert commander of the technical rescue team, said: “The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from below.
He did not move his eyebrow during the rescue — he was completely frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The sighting of a dog is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, expert commander of the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and apart from exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was scared when I saw the rescue.”
First of all, I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
Firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there."
Firefighters were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says he didn’t drive after Katy Perry.
During an interview for an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she added, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me."
In a statement Thursday, Jagger’s 70-year-old deputy said he categorically refused to make any suggestions to Katy Perry.
The representative said, “Maybe you’re confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe Gives Scots a Choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that the condition for an independent Scotland to join the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport controls at Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as might be expected, it did not make headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if it suits them.
Since Scotland is not currently in Schengen, the offer of continued mismatch would be a cheap concession to Brussels in return for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
I heard the journalistic duck that “independence means passport controls” at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting thought in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why trade the London ham for the Brussels ham, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
As a result of the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, they are gaining influence from parties dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came out of nowhere and already looted nearly five million votes in the September federal election, essentially sweeping the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
On home soil there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, coupled with a tight jacket drawn on national economies by clinging to a common currency, has led many to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments managing high budget deficits – this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only way to do this is to cut revenues and public spending – as Germany is urging.
Behind the current problems with the budget and the currency, there is a deeper cause of Europe's malaise.
As a result of the “green” energy policy backed by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at the expense of consumers – European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as is the case in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the freezing of wages in the world would not prevent the European petrochemical industry from trampling on cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering uprising, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would keep Germany in check and allow Paris to rise to the level of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a sign of political legitimacy, and has enforced its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that a split on the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use next year’s European elections to create an anti-European bloc against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in this election, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in its history.
At the same time, I think that in the near future the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will unite and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but rather turn into something more free in the sense of the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and to cling to the United States.
However, Washington’s heightened interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be a region (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – that includes telling Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I assume that Scotland would do well in a relaxed order of Europe, provided it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, strangely enough, the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition stance against cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: matured earlier
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is approaching.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this.
Experts say that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened when her daughter begins to grow breasts and pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic and armpit hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Over the past 40 years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age at which the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
“When the breasts start to develop, it takes at least two to three years for the first menstruation to occur,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
The most reliable test of how puberty will proceed is time.
It is discussed what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered "prematurely mature".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be closely monitored by children’s doctors.
A faster growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to stopping growth and stunting in adulthood.
Recommendations for medications and hormone treatments depend on the child’s age, rate of development, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but recognizes that “repressing puberty can alleviate a girl’s behavioral problems and her feelings of being different from her peers.”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried she might get pregnant or how she'll manage her hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation, it was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school frightened and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no consistent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped carry out a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, it seems that patterns of early puberty are influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although boys have facial and pubic hair at a young age, the trend towards full bloom of early puberty is not as clear as girls.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Association of Pediatric Physicians (AAP) added more complexity to the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
“We have to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeo Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to your child sooner than you'd expect," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need to be reassured that even if it happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadia Konvalinková in the role of a tavern.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nadia Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub and she was very good at it.
Is it possible that the popular Czech actress planned to change her profession and went into business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinková appeared at the James Joyce Irish Pub and shot beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I was good at it.
My boss even offered to hire me so I could make a living making beer.
But I refused, I’d rather stay with what I’m doing to this day, with acting,” said Konvalinkova, who was a guest at the Irish pub’s twentieth anniversary.
"I like Irish beer, and I'll have Irish whiskey," she said.
Nadi, a long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nov<0xC3><0xBD>, also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I can't drink in this new life.
I’m allowed one beer or one drink a day, and that’s what I’m trying to do.”
Aircraft manufacturers are arguing about the width of the seats, large orders are at stake
A dispute over the width of second-class seats for long-haul flights has raged among leading aircraft manufacturers, prompting a bitter exchange of views this month on the Dubai air show.
The subject of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-haul flights for economy class – not exactly that which would normally be preceded by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency requirements of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but Boeing’s main US rival says it’s up to airlines to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell the largest version of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.
The way the rear of the aircraft is arranged – especially if there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis of the economic performance requirements for the design of new aircraft “mini-jumbo”.
Boeing says the upgraded 777X will carry 406 people in economy seats more than 43cm wide, spread out 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 46 cm wide economy seats spread out over nine.
Giant aircraft often attack each other in technical matters through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to take the lead with more than 100 orders.
Recently, he tentatively showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed a picture of three people crowded in a restaurant with the headline “Would you like it?”
“Boeing promotes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
As the eating habits change, people are bigger, but the seats on airplanes have not changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, to the turn of the century, the weight of the average 40- to 49-year-old American has increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims its rival is sticking to the seat concept of the 1950s, when the average seat width of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research suggesting that extending the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing rejects the size of Airbus’ seats, saying it is not up to aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fees and equipment.
The company also says research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines the flexibility to do the things they believe they need to do in order to be successful,” said Kent Craver, a cabin expert.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
More elbow space is essential for passengers, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this controversy is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated trade of at least $700 billion in catalog prices over the next decades, enough to deflect the weightings of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent more efficiency than the market leader in the segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER, in their latest designs of twin-engine long-haul aircraft.
Boeing’s performance demands depend in part on comparing the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to stuff more seats and make its aircraft more competitive over our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Airbus Europe’s passenger comfort chief.
On the other hand, analysts say that the 10-seater cabins in a row for the existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are in favour of a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“A 45 cm seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Traveling aircraft vendors even carry a bandwidth with them to check the competitive layout.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density layout aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the need for more cabin modifications by offering wider seats in the aisles for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will remain unheard, but it can deter the wave of sales of the 777X.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague has exceeded one thousand
In the Czech Republic, the number of infections is growing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 people were infected, a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavaty, an AIDS expert who has led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, from January to September last year there were 165 HIV patients in the country, this year there were 176 in the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up until the end of September, tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
The number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian or 116 from <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem.
The least infected are from the Highlands, there were 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with a blood transfusion in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV and passed on to them from their mother.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, say experts
A fantastic film from the space Gravity some time after the premiere sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers and earned over CZK 26 million.
Most of the reviews review the picture positively.
However, there are some inconsistencies in it.
Lidovky.cz asked astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films, which I consider modern, dreamy fairy tales.
Gravity is a movie, even though it looks like a “physically real” performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it a lot.
You may notice, for example, Sandra Bullock's hair, which somehow does not float in a weightless state.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station travel in vastly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one image.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and the entire behavior of the fire in a state of weightlessness.
The suits, they said, wouldn't stand such blows either.
The heroes in Gravity often come into collision with various objects, and suits withstand everything without much hassle.
Criticism was not spared, nor the plot.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth’s orbit is unrealistic, according to some.
In addition, she wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People are also arguing in the forums about the "unrealistic" behavior of the ropes.
It looks like it was designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium in Prague): I have only seen him on a wide screen, but I can definitely say that I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, it was science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost the obligation) not to stick to reality consistently.
"More than the discrepancies you mentioned, I was touched by the way the space station with the degrading level of technology (last time Chinese) is shown three times."
“China will be in the end of the decade, and it will probably look better than it is in the movie.”
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in trying not to violate the laws of physics, and so a science-oriented viewer will appreciate that during various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of momentum is quite correctly preserved, including the physicist's dictionary, the physicist's view of the Earth and the cosmos's.
Irregularities will certainly be found on closer examination.
In addition, while reading the comments, for example, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic debris in orbit appears to be reversed in some scenes than it should actually be (from west to east).
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators to their needs, but I have not noticed any fundamental and heavenly offense against logic or natural laws in the film.
Of the moments that make no sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a differently inclined orbit than the ISS.
As a result, the speed of each other varies considerably, and the rescue operation could not actually take place as it was shown in the film.
Then, at the time of the separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, and therefore there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at a moment when they are no longer moving towards each other.
A new nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
More tests are needed before human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York says the first signs are good.
“We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is so strong as to overcome all current approaches,” Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been assembled to carry the genetic information to create anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies chase all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus preventing the smoker from getting nicotine interference.
In tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently supplied with nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But mice that weren’t vaccinated “calmed down,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had gotten into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often as to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies that they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower, as it converts liver cells into factories producing antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they feel like trying a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
However, it is much more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of that bad habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Corruption Oversight Committee.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing coastal lease policies at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled property.
On Friday, the Independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to renew his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café, without having to take part in a tender after it expired in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's covert interests in these properties, on the basis of evidence presented on Thursday by Mr Tripodi's former Deputy Chief of Staff, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go to public tenders.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term terms of the contract.
In 2009, leases to businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
He denied, however, that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in the government's rent policy.
The transcript of the calls submitted to the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior officer who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the fishing department.
"Was the development of commercial rental policy the subject of the talks during these phone calls?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes hit target in Syria, senior official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, a senior administration official told Fox News.
The official did not specifically say what the goal was, but said there was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out an airstrike on a supply of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pe<0xC4><0x8D>inka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with this, while the chairman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>ch fomented discord.
Captain Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of this misery.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, Vice President Zaorálek made it impossible most of all by talking on TV.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to propose Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>ková as the Prime Minister's Vice-President of the Senate, who alone would not have an initial handicap and I think would perform a standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone from the leadership will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>ková could safely form a minority government with only a blessing from President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and without the People’s Party, but with the People’s Party’s Health Minister Hovorka, who is actually a religious Social Democrat.
This mini-minority government would have great stability because it would promote a proper referendum law, which President Dawn Okamura has pledged to support.
President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> would eventually come to terms with the progress of taxes, because he is smart and he will see that it is not possible without it.
People would not bring problems, because Call is the bearer of the best they have, and otherwise they would not be in the government.
The same is true of YES, and a valuable minister would be found here, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, also well.
Let's give Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>ková courage!
Foreign Workers with Visa Permits May Pass the “Eligibility Test”
As the government plans to expand police interventions, it is considering a “eligibility” test for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unqualified jobs, or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When the government’s discussion paper was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The loud statements of ‘foreigners at the end of the line’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very annoying remnant of a time when unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that white labor was to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if anyone in the region had noticed an echo of this historic artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to deal with officials on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest remain to be considered.
If the ‘eligibility’ criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail to see if ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal relationship with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking’.
After previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of them, companies may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum has died with a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship in the Christmas Islands this week.
The man’s nine-year-old frightened son was traveling to Australia with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities rushed him to a hospital in the Christmas Islands, where he died.
The British government has announced a study that aims to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring the UK together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase Two, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which has been in talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 to investigate further rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that better connects the UK and its cities.”
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
HS2 will make it easier to connect 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed line has the potential to bring immeasurable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland’s overall high-speed rail case across Britain.”
So we are excited to work with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to benefit everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning to do anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with British ministers over the next year and deciding together on the next steps.
Together with Bárta, anti-corruption police inspectors and analysts arrested
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to circulate on Thursday evening, when the news came from the server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS) was in charge of the case, its people were to arrest Bárta in the center of Prague.
It took place in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
Inspections deal with cases where police officers are among the accused, but its jurisdiction also applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police, Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek, head of analytics and computer science, was among the arrested.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
However, anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej declined to comment on the information, adding that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
Her spokeswoman, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, but immediately referred it to the Municipal Public Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said the spokeswoman of the embassy, <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová.
It can also be inferred from this vague reaction that the event took place, but it is in a mode of secrecy that does not allow speakers to say anything concrete.
Bart’s lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Bárta "also in this matter", but given that this is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bárta's arrest.
At first, some media speculated that Bart’s arrest could be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted by Bárta together with the former head of the Ministry of the Interior, Radek John.
The dispute that erupted between the ex-prime minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and the VV had to be resolved even by the then president Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about it," Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Officially, he was promoted by Radek John, but the real leader of the party at that time was Bárta.
Bárta was now running for the election for the Dawn movement, his parliamentary mandate escaped only narrowly - by 175 votes.
Tomio Okamura, the leader of Dawn, said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties in our candidate and, as I have repeatedly said before the election, he was not or is not a member of Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomio Okamura," he distanced himself from Bárta Okamura, who before the election said that he gave Bárta space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem.
Vít Bárta was in court in 2012 with his former VV partner Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>kárka.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, regardless of changes in the U.S. in order to ease regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. airlines the space to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in “air” mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision, which requires a lot of work from U.S. carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their practices anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had reviewed the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft,” he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken with CASA about expanding the use of its onboard wi-fi entertainment system, was in favour of the change but announced it would submit to the regulatory authority’s decision.
“We would welcome CASA to conduct an analysis of permissions to use electronic devices because we really think that this would improve customer experience now that we have [wireless onboard entertainment],” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with current regulations for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices are not allowed to be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon,” he said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in regulatory developments that may be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly thoroughly study the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. airlines, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference on mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and passenger information.
“Once the airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, at any altitude,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew instructs passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stored under the seats or in the overhead storage area during takeoff and descent.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings so she can pay her daughter’s tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 ($3,000 SGD) each month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is such that ValueMax, where a woman is carrying out her transaction, has become the third pawnbroker on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – SGD 1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it’s also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And as families feel pressured by rising living costs and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans backed by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households mainly due to rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the ranking with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also feared the high levels of consumption debt in Thailand, which this week has just emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from medium to low [income scale] will try to replenish their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia’s CIMB Bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have prompted people to swiftly seize their personal assets and seize the opportunity to exchange their family jewellery for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops are gold.
People say, the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand’s largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshop in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage industry is so great that ValueMax, the operator of a branch in the center of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax Yeah CEO Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it raised on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn’t directly increase debt.
“Customers are stopping items they already own, and monetizing personal property does not increase the household’s debt,” he says.
In society, a pledge of property is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secured financing.
Moreover, among those who use pawnshops, there are not only people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when stopping gold bars or Rolex watches, and can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all possible circumstances.
“These include wealthy individuals who need short-term borrowing because of their bold trades or investments, or small businesses who need help solving problems in their cash flow,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as fast as possible.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for the dying health care system in Tasmania includes tough conditions to ensure the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said the Australian Union is taking "accelerated measures" to avert a crisis caused by the island's aging population, higher numbers of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems the state faces," Plibersekova said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for surgeries at the patient’s request.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic and cataract surgeries, will help to eliminate indebtedness.
There is also money for open clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services, and the introduction of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to ideas that leading clinicians have told me will best help the Tasmanian health system,” said Ms. Plibersekova.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must demand a strict reporting regime and record-keeping obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the money of the Australian Union, and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee shall be set up to ensure that the State supplies the services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million would be of no use “unless there is a real reform to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system.”
Still, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first made during talks with the prime minister in early May.
"I believe that the federal aid package can lift the state's public health from a critical condition," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Peter Dutton, a spokesman for the federal opposition in the health sector, believes that today’s statement is just a “patch.”
“The reason I’m here is that the Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from our healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a state government that takes away nearly half a billion dollars and the Australian Union that gives away 300 million dollars and pretend that it’s good news.
Mr Dutton called on Mrs Plibersekova to guarantee that not a single dollar from the rescue package would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted Denis Diderot’s novella, which brings an exceptional film journey and a portrayal of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in the 1860s in France, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she experiences extremely cruel treatment from the reprehensibly depraved superior mother, and for another she becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips to lust or sensuality, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that even viewers will experience torment similar to wearing a fur shirt.

Syria Destroys Its Chemical Weapons, Says Supervisory Authority
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, the Global Chemical Weapons Oversight Committee said on Thursday, as violent conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before November 1,
the term set by the Hague-based organisation for Damascus for the destruction or disabling of all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the purpose of creating toxic gas and ammunition refuelling.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
The country is estimated to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement comes as fighting rages on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons factory and storage facility, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
A group of activists who monitored the total death toll in Syria through a network of activists said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah are expected to be on the side.
Among those killed were 2,202 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting the rebels in Safira, many of whom have been linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The watchdog said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific figures.
The fighting has highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have to deal with tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal amid the ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW office, which works closely with the UN, said its team is now “pleased to have verified – and monitored the destruction – of Syria’s declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling.”
He added that “no further control activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two places due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been “abandoned and ... the items of the chemical weapons program it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I pay tribute to the courage and bravery you have shown in carrying out this most challenging mission this organization has ever had,” said Ahmet Uzumcu, director of observers, in a comment issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government, with their security forces full of members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam, are at odds in the civil war.
As for further developments, Rami Abdul Rahman, the head of the Observatory, said there had been a strong explosion inside air defense facilities in Syria’s coastal province of Lazikiya on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict of the perpetrator of the Bali bombing
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict handed down to the last of the planners who were brought to justice, saying Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Tuesday for building explosive devices used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, leaving 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related indictments, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The indictment demanded a life sentence, even though it could have insisted that a man nicknamed "Demolition Man" be sentenced to death because of his reputation as an expert in explosives production.
The decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
Ms Corteen told AAP: “He should be put in front of an execution squad.”
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., when a heavy bomb was detonated inside a parked van.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while being kept alive, three times the doctors "died".
Mr Hughes said Patek should face the same fate as the three other members of the Jama Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others isn't much.
Patek was the last of the attackers in Bali.
He evaded arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt regret for how much grief he has caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air Passengers Can Now Use Technological Advances on Airplanes (But Cannot Call From Their Mobile Phones)
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from gate to gate" - in addition to calling from their mobile phones - to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Passengers, however, should not expect the changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the cabin crew training manuals and storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches an altitude of 3 kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the aircraft is down to land, and not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and rolling, the FAA said.
Most new passenger aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are safely implemented - and we will work closely with transport companies to do so - it will be a success," Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of looking like “guardians.”
However, surfing the Internet, sending emails and sms or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to Air Mode.
So Still No Words with Friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when, as is well known, he was thrown off an American Airlines plane because he refused to shut down his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored because of fears that they could hurt someone if they flew around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using mobile phones are not set by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Commission.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transportation Safety, an expert on national security in transport at CBS News, said mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that in the air they can cause interference to broadcast towers,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue proposed last month that the government should allow wider use of electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been exerted on the FAA to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical feat of the time.
New airlines are much more reliant on electric systems than previous generation aircraft, but they are also engineered, and approved by the FAA, to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio broadcasting than those of previous generations.
For example, e-readers only produce minimal broadcasts when you turn a page.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.
Among those pushing to loosen restrictions on travelers’ use of these devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the airliner with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passengers Association said he believes the interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members have stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference to aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device while flying under low-visibility instruments.
The Travel Industry Group welcomed these changes and believes that this is a sensible approach for the public travelling and making extensive use of the technology.
“We are delighted that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was transported to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One snail was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at a rescue center until he recovered.
Operating center Colin Seddon said: "This snoring probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught over the North Sea by a strong wind."
Apparently, he ran out of strength and took refuge on an oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us with a request for help."
By the time the rattlesnake was released, he was in good shape and healthy.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to merge businesses and define what changes British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we asked leading British entrepreneurs their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing UK businesses of all sizes and sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnant.
They want to see the government favor new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get caught up in the long and arduous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European business area – even 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European companies, expressed their agreement.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most eloquent insight, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek a treaty change and a relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, which have been identified with companies of various sizes and major business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will transfer the influence back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake – achieving a treaty change and a better deal for the UK could mean a gain of up to 16% in a referendum on remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift from the current balance of power back towards the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible and, as the eurozone embarks on a path towards a narrower economic and fiscal union, increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority and, as our survey shows, for business, this means re-focusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry: “Spying has gone too far”
The U.S. has sometimes gone “too far” in spying, U.S. Foreign Secretary John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
The gathering of information, according to the minister, served to avert terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington" comes amid heated controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations about mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), targeting US allies.
“In some cases, I admit, as President [Barack Obama] has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure you that will not happen in the future,” Kerry said.
Above all, he defended his previous practice.
The gathering of information is necessary to fight terrorism and prevent attacks such as the attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004, and the attacks in London in July 2005.
“We prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we were able to be informed in time of the plots,” Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went unreasonably far".
The scandal over U.S. intelligence, which reportedly monitored hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans also monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders have made no secret of their resentment, and some have called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that prohibits or significantly restricts surveillance.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is starting a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom’s director said.
“Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports through Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risks of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “always” eliminated.
Once the entire project is operational in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is scheduled to begin in other flow-oriented countries later this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamun.
According to ever-increasing reports, Israel destroyed Hezbollah-designated missiles during Wednesday’s airstrikes at two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting on the side of the Lebanese army in Syria.
Its program is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of weapons to the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday’s Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria are yet to be clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but U.S. sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snoubar Jabla south of Latakia.
The al-Arabiya news station said two depots were hit, where the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is teaching Hezbollah’s armed forces how to handle missiles.
SA-8s are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are located on a movable chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to their mobility and small size, they can be easily hidden.
They are equipped with radar, which turns off after firing the missile, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
He says he helps protect the Syrian Shia community to which the Alawites belong.
Now 15,000 of his warriors are reportedly ready to help the army recapture Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country, Homs.
The battle is said to be in retaliation for the recent attack by the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shia Brigade of Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shia part of Damascus.
Hezbollah has helped the Syrian army recapture the city of Kusayr near the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusair went to Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, squandering money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax hikes and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
Based on the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens were satisfied with this state of affairs.
That they did not really mind and with the state that was there (the plundering and indebtedness of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not vote, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted ODS in total, so 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all legitimate voters.
That is the overwhelming majority.
When I add 1,016,829 <0xC4><0x8C>SSD voters to the aforementioned parties, then in the old order (because all the aforementioned parties participated in the "theft" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the legitimate voters actually agreed with this situation.
In fact, the majority of voters have made it clear that they are not robbing and over-indebted this state to punish the culprits.
Or do you think that the members of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD who participated in this will advocate the appropriate laws?
Is there any way to help us?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) were charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned that before charges were filed against child caregiver Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with child sexual abuse.
But the committee said in its opening statement to the committee, the association said it had never dealt with a child sexual abuse case in its organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a YMCA gymnast in Caringbah was convicted in 1991 of sexually harassing children in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaila Furness, an advisor to the commission, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA’s opening statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits had been conducted within the YMCA, which recognized the organization as a leading advocate for children’s rights.
The evidence presented by the Commission indicates that YMCA was alerted to the fact that in the August audit of the Ministry of Education and Society it received the second lowest of the four possible ratings.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the guidance from himself downwards failed when he received Mr. Lord, without making sure that the staff was aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually harassing 12 boys while working for the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, denied allegations that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Mr. Lord's child safety breach.
Staff members provided evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, privately watching them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to."
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt uncomfortable if they had to contact their superiors and report the deeds.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had darkened their judgment, and therefore they had not reported the problem.
Mr Hare said he had told the YMCA Board in New South Wales that the lesson learned from the “Jonathan Lord case” for the organization was that the staff “didn’t report anything,” and the Board agreed.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA Children’s Services General Manager Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid distortion of evidence, but was “excessively zealous” and poorly executed.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, an expert on child sexual abuse at Griffith University, told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organization for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, screening, recruitment, training and leadership.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that a return is unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he resigned after ten years in a leadership position, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talking about British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Middle East Peace Quartet envoy.
When asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, the London Evening Standard quoted his answer as follows: “Yes, of course, but that’s probably not going to happen, is it, so...”
While crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he had not yet gone to school and had only taken his first steps a few months ago, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, glided smoothly through three laps to finally win the grand prize and leave behind 30 dragged adult rivals.
This inseparable pair – of the same height – was praised for their looks, behaviour and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He confronted the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tipped his beret to a cheerful angle, and had his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control the horse, which far exceeded his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton received Toffee on his third birthday in March, and has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day since then.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are working together great."
They didn't have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells says, “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was cheering and applauding.”
He ran on the sand all over the arena, and although he did so little, he did a great job.
Fenton is obsessed with animals—he loves horses, tractors, and a farm—and has two chickens in charge.
Given how he started, he's going to be at Horse of the Year again soon, and I'm sure he's going to do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said, "Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony."
They make a great team together.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed on the circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork is between the pony and whoever leads it – and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's cute outfit helped, too, he really fit in there with him.
Too curious newspapers to be investigated
The Chinese newspapers, which requested the release of the reporter accused of defamation on the front page, will be thoroughly investigated, the administrator told the press.
The Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a state-owned company.
The warden said the New Express newspaper would now make a "full correction".
The order to “correct” came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in the province of Guangdong.
The preliminary investigation revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports about the aforementioned Zoomlion company.
"The editorial board of the New Express newspaper was disordered," the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had decided to “impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revoking his journalistic license.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out an overall correction of the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant New Express officials and immediately change the leadership of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express about financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page, claiming to be behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted to publishing untrue stories for a fee.
“In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion, as well as to the entire media industry and its ability to gain the public’s trust,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realize I've acted wrongly.
After Mr. Chen’s apology, New Express issued an apology on the front page stating that he had failed to check his reports sufficiently.
Recently, several heavily monitored suspects made a confession on television.
Experts say confessions are still being made on a regular basis, despite this year’s law change that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A drug smuggling tunnel between the U.S. and Mexico has been found with its own railroad.
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been discovered, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railways.
U.S. authorities have described the tunnel, measuring roughly one meter by one, as one of the most ingenious secret passageways they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which swings to the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana in Mexico and in San Diego in the United States.
The area is full of indefinite warehouses, where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unnoticed.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
The three men, who were said to have worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
If convicted, he faces sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are infiltrating extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest tunnel discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a challenge to drug cartels on how to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a 650-meter-long corridor equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Centre combine management.
For example, they offer joint advertising.
New integrated newsroom of the company Economy in Prague Karlín.
Economy has taken the next step in transforming Centrum Holding into its media house.
Since Friday, Economy and the Center have joint top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of the two publishers into a common media house," commented Kamil <0xC4><0x8C>ermák, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Economy and Deputy CEO, on the changes.
<0xC4><0x8C>ermák, who will lead the unified management, will be complemented by Andreas Demuth, Executive Director of Centrum Holdings.
Pavel Voparil was appointed as the new joint director of the store, to which Zuzana Tyl<0xC4><0x8D>erová, the advertising director of both companies, is also subordinate.
The new head of information technology became <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán Burda.
The joint director of the editorial offices is Vladimír Piská<0xC4><0x8D>ek, whose team includes Jakub Unger, Director for Transformation.
Adéla Pittsová was the newly established Marketing Director.
V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Lhotská now manages a separate corporate communications department.
The joint financial director is Karel <0xC5><0xBD>alud, human resources management for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to enter the market with a joint offer of advertising products, to better connect the creation of the content of all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," <0xC4><0x8C>ermák added.
Economy, owned by financer Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, entered into an agreement to acquire Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The portfolio of Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, <0xC5><0xBD>ena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brand names Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz, and SMB agency Najisto, as well as a portfolio of almost two dozen other smaller websites.
Economy is the publisher of Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny, news server IHNED.cz, weekly magazines Respect and Ekonom and a number of printed and Internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its major titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CME will target the TV business.
Almost a quarter of the people will be fired.
The CME media group will be fired.
He wants to slim down a thousand people by the end of the year.
He intends to cut all the side activities and only wants to focus on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CET 21 is a part of CME, which holds licenses for Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telek and the Czech version of MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV No. 1 TV Nova, is still unclear.
"It's premature and we can't really comment on it," said Josef Koukolí<0xC4><0x8D>ek, Nova's communications director.
According to MF DNES, significant redundancies in the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should have on the staffing status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both of Nova’s new bosses, Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who succeeded longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday about wanting to restrict all activities that are not directly related to the TV business.
Therefore, it is quite likely that it will significantly reduce, in particular, the costs of producing its own programs, filmmaking and production activities.
A cooling tower burned down at the CKD industrial complex in Prague at night
In the industrial area of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in Prague, a large storage tank was burning, according to firefighters, probably a cooling tower.
"Firefighters started the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, and this morning they were still putting out the fire," said a spokeswoman for the Prague firefighters, Pavlina Adamcová.
The amount of pollutants in the surrounding air according to the measurements did not exceed the permitted limits.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are unknown.
Approximately five dozen firefighters arrived at the area on Kolbenova Street.
"This is a large-capacity tank fire, probably a cooling tower," Adamcová said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we are extinguishing it using a transport line from the tanks," she added.
According to tn.cz, the extinguishing was complicated by a poorly functioning hydrant network, so firefighters had to transport water from elsewhere.
The fire chief issued a second-degree fire alarm.
There are a total of four stages, in the most serious situations, a fourth is declared.
Chemists also went to the site to check the level of hazardous substances that could have entered the air in the fire.
"But they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that exceeded the hygienic standards," a firefighters spokeswoman said.
British Police Deliver Extradition Notice to Assange
British police have delivered an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had handed the 40-year-old Australian a "notice of extradition" asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not, he could face arrest.
Assange has exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden on sexual felony charges.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he applied for asylum in the South American country.
“Scotland Yard has delivered an extradition notice to a 40-year-old man, asking him to come to the police station on the day and hour designated for him,” the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the release notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face espionage charges after publishing 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving over 200km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a drink cup between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to reimburse the costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100 for the defendant.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble bursts
The Treasury Department has provisionally quantified the tax on financial assets, but awaits the final decision of Mr Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% property transfer fee for buildings worth over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for buyers who own property within the company, not as individuals.
Property transfer fee revenue in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea districts, which reached <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “Given the increase in property transfers at high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is undertaxed regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system.”
He added that “this move may have caused some foreign investors to hesitate to buy properties in London or to hesitate to sell them to existing owners.”
Leading properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich belt that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon saw a record 11.8% increase last year.
Prices in central London continued to grow steadily by 5.6% year-on-year, but were overshadowed by a booming “home market” where, according to a Savills survey, the southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) grew.
Scientists have more clarified how the movements of the tail are related to the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that cheerful dogs swing their tails more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs swing their tails mostly to the left.
But now scientists say other dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions.”
We've tried to observe the same thing in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to learn more about how dogs respond to the asymmetrical spin of other dogs’ tails, the researchers monitored animals who watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tails go one way and the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We screened dog films – either in a natural version or in a silhouette – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the movement of the tail and portray it more to the right or left.”
When the animals saw an otherwise faint dog move its tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog swinging its tail), it remained completely calm.
But when she noticed the tail turning mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog swinging the tail), their heart rate increased and the animals seemed uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn’t think dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and need not watch out for.
He said: “If you encounter dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior, and movement to the right breeds less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience.”
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand the emotions of their pets.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a college animal health teacher at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another treatise from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dog robots were more likely to get acquainted when they swing their tails to the left than to the right, when they were more likely to become insecure – quite the opposite of the Italian study.”
The difference may be due to the fact that the dogs in these different studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the dog robots completely as dogs.
He explained that studies on how dogs react to real dogs could help.
“Although there is strong evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail goes sometimes one way and sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The Arctic Monkeys have postponed a concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was due to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
Singer Alex Turner's illness forced her to postpone the show.
The announcement came after the band was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone today’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and based on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the performance at the Hydro Complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and will unfortunately not be able to get out."
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the performance at the Hydro Complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets for these shows remain valid.
We would like to apologize to everyone who bought tickets for the inconvenience that this caused them.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will nominate new cardinals for the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church after the pope and are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men to ultimately help choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group is reduced to 120 electors.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting of the current cardinals, known as the Consistorium, would be held before the solemn promotion of the new cardinals.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of electors again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, Europe and, above all, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that these cardinals would be asked by the pope for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is completely new.
Valero said the popes have traditionally promoted bishops from great places to cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he’s naming.”
GM recalls some new light trucks in the U.S. to repair seat backs
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to repair a manually tilting backrest defect, according to an announcement Friday from the U.S. automotive safety authority.
For some of these vehicles, the tilting mechanism of the front seats may be defective.
As a result, seat backs do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that “if a car gets hit from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the occupants, increasing the risk of injury.”
Downloaded models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the vehicle in June, marking the most important launch since its restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the van about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notices to owners due to a 16-day government shutdown that weakened car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra vans, which were redesigned for 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models out of its deliveries.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperate Cries of Obama’s Voters
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have been frustrated by the Republican Party's obstruction
Obstructive Politics Cannot Excuse Obama’s Healthcare Website’s Trouble or Drone Attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard University in his second year.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the gloomy days of my second year at the medical school it would encourage me and renew a pinch of hope in me.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews tonight and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelming supremacy, and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept the newspapers they got.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When he took office in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And here I close the book.
Going into the present is a rough awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days—they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I put in my first ballot, there have actually been changes.
It was definitely nothing I had imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the Affordable Care Act to the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy of “no questions, no words” after the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party's obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, the public's choice of health care, and the closure of the Guantánamo base, among others.
But after many situations in which I defended the Obama administration against colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the consent to the wiretapping of foreign leaders or the drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, nor that it persecutes those who expose the wrongdoings of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process, or for limiting public contributions and expenditures during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of the report, which says that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, they can not even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the Affordable Care Act a simple website.
I don't know if that was to be expected.
Whether I should have suspected at the age of 18 that government power might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected office is clearly not predictable, and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events like the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbroken alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we once heard about.
Yet returning to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – through this book is becoming increasingly difficult.
It reminds me of a series of promises that have vanished.
This week I read a chapter in a book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he needed to get back on track and stay true to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this commentary are solely the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Says Prime Minister Tony Abbott Is In Conflict Of Interest Over Parental Leave Program
Billionaire and lawmaker Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over a parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a dispute over the payment of a $6 million tax on coal, made the claim while trying to sweep away the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy coal taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be involved in a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit personally from the policy.
“He got into a big conflict of interest regarding paid parental leave because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the fight for the seat for Fairfax District in the Sunshine Coast region after winning 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results in order to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the polling stations?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, squeeze the details into the computer, vote immediately, and have the results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is, can the results be erased if someone doesn't like it?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently published a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political agenda extended to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
A public office is a public service.
“We are not seeking any reward except to be able to serve society at this critical time,” he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands can change your mood as well.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve an unsolvable problem.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that had accidentally washed their hands had a much more optimistic impression than the one where the participants had not.
Also, the "hands-washed" group performed better in the next test than the other.
Still, those who washed their hands scored worse in other tests than those who didn’t.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not record any previous failures.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical cleanliness eliminates the really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, the motivation is decreasing, the tests need to be much more concentrated in the next tests.
If we transferred the results of the research to the Czechs, we would probably be most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After using the toilet, not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but after traveling by public transport, it is already a fifth.
They usually stick to hygiene after work in the garden or in the workshop, when 85% of people wash their hands.
Pet caressing motivates 78.7% of people to wash their hands.
Recent research has revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks as to how much it is necessary to wash your hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of Czechs and 40.3% of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I am afraid that the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," commented the results of the research skin doctor Claudia Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign exchange division, another indication that global investigations by supervisory authorities into suspected currency market manipulation are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the competent authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where they change hands every day for $5.3 trillion.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of an expanding investigation in response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interest Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
“Our relentless investigation into this matter continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said in a statement two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event said RBS handed over records of emails and instant messages sent from and to the accounts of the former trader to the UK Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved of his current position as European chairman of foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European chairman of cash trading at Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Usher’s IM group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people inside the event said.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Switzerland’s Finma regulator announced it was investigating suspected foreign-currency market manipulations at several Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations that these bankers have teamed up to move the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the relevant authorities.
Banks are sifting through years-old instant messages and emails to find cases of some kind of misconduct.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest drivers of profit making in investment banks’ closings in recent years, but which has been disrupted by small currency volatility limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation by arguing that with a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this may not necessarily be true.
A senior trader said that despite a significant volume of foreign exchange day trading, fragmenting liquidity between different trading platforms and banks by increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at fairly low prices.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired a trader from its stock trading department this week who had caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the competent authorities and cooperated with their supervisory authorities.
“We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this issue has been resolved,” Credit Suisse said in a statement.
The number of HIV infections in Prague has exceeded one thousand
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the monitoring in 1986 until the end of this year's third quarter, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to the statistics of the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the National Health Institute.
According to her, 2,063 people have been infected throughout the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, the disease of immune failure has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year over the past decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
In 2009, 156 new infections were detected, and in 2010, 180.
Last year the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who has led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of the year, tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavaty said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has been reported in 161 men and 37 women.
Most of the infected people were in Prague.
If you really want to know a city, you should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a stroll through the painted centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than a beeker would reveal.
Many people “read from the graves.”
Cemeteries are slowly wandering and gaining intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what beliefs, what large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, how they have taste.
And from the condition of the tombs, they will see how the survivors take care of their dead.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is in line with the constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
In a 5:4 vote, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise they risk paying a fine – does not contradict the constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
The president of the court, John Roberts, was on the side of the four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also upheld the remaining parts of the 2,700-page law and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which orders states to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise risks losing all funding for sickness insurance from federal sources, is not enforceable and contrary to the constitution.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 primaries, the law vehemently rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
The words “Mugabe is a lame donkey” no longer face jail, the court abolished the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to publicly talking about Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s and has been in charge since the end of 1987.
Under section 33 of the Criminal Code, a $100 fine of up to one year’s imprisonment could be imposed for contempt of office.
"Prosecutors should not zealously accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the court said in a statement.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal the court’s decision, the BBC reported.
A number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Dango, who was arrested two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a quarrel with a policeman in a bar, were loudly delineated against the law.
In May, an opposition activist in public speaking to Mugabe was imprisoned with the slander of a "lame donkey".
In August, prosecutors indicted a 26-year-old man over his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe’s face as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
“The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be untrue,” Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala said.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
“The existence of a law that makes it possible to criminalize someone for making false statements has a freezing effect on the right to freedom of expression,” Malala said.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in a referendum in March.
Small steps away from the one-man dictatorship of the country began in 2009, when a deal between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangirai to the prime minister's seat.
However, the country continues to be plagued by an economic crisis and, until 2008, by the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government abolished the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe pays only with the currency of other countries.
The impoverished economy is being driven by Mugabe’s reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with farming.
Central banks to maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need it.
The banks said this in a joint statement.
“This is a very sensible step,” said Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays Bank.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is not surprising to me," adds Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Benda, Chief Economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers are reinforcing ties that began in 2007, when the international credit market first stalled.
Central bank agreements have given access to euros, dollars, and other currencies to anyone who needs them.
The central banker’s decision comes as the Fed prepares to end its program to support the U.S. economy, which could drive the price of money in the global market even higher.
A swap contract is typically used to overcome the liquidity shortfall of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as the deposit of one currency and the borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
However, I did not finish this one because there was just someone sitting at the branch who could not complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn’t want to go to another branch, registration failed, then I moved and thanks to that my address and ID number changed.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it was not possible because I have a different OP number, address and that it is simply not possible to complete it and that I should request the deletion of data and make a new registration.
That is what I did and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database in accordance with the applicable law on personal data protection.
On that day, technical support wrote me that I have to complete the registration at the branch.
Thus began a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where finally after the 4th emergency on 25.10. they wrote that they had deleted personal data at my request.
One would think that he could do that new registration and here the problems started again. First it wrote me that my username was already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not personal data, but eventually they deleted this too).
So I used a different username and it appeared to me that my personal data had already been saved to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When I was asked how it was possible, they wrote to me that personal data had actually been deleted on 25.10. and that I should send an e-mail with the error.
I did that (yesterday around 3 p.m.) and they wrote me back today that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that that is why it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
I've been contacting technical support for a week now and I'm still trying to figure out how to do this.
And what if what they claim to be true (as if it were not) could not be registered by anyone with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way in those 13.22 I actually registered, at the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictitious e-mail and phone number and the world wondered, a page appeared to me that they sent me an e-mail link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register with the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport ties the registration to the e-mail and phone number, and the data is simply not eliminated as it claims.
So I again told this to the technical support that they are simply lying (either intentionally or they do not know what they are writing), because what they are writing is not true.
I have documented several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so the "false" registration simply does not affect this.
Tipsport responded to me with a harsh sentence - I'm sorry, but since you are already registered again, we cannot verify your claim.
And he stopped communicating.
Or, he repeats the same sentence over and over again that the registration is tied to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and so it did not actually happen.
So, to summarize, not only has Tipsport not erased the data as it claims, but it is lying when it claims otherwise.
Worse still, it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the mistake is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after posting this issue on my personal blog, things got a little moving and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter is being submitted for verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgent and arguing and warning of the same error).
Music plays on the bridge in the subway
The transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague has launched the project Music in the Metro.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music is played continuously during metro operations, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test run will last six months.
Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek presented his new double album, band and three singers
Texter Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek brought to the hall of the Cologne City Social House not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but above all in the program Between Us singers Lenka Nova, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad and Ondra Rumla accompanied by the excellent Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Benko Orchestra.
After the introductory intro and the acting etude about the delayed musician, Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of the last time they played in Cologne and in the theater, and the electricity was out throughout the city.
"Otherwise, in Cologne they produced two types of cards, with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
He also reminded the native of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who had not left the stage and if he had not spoken, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical deed.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astrologer, but he had no idea about ice hockey at the time, as we meet in those squares and chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That’s the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we’re not going to play it for you here today,” he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang a very suitable song for him from this record: Sleep by day, sing at night, and accompanied him on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, then all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three of the vocalists sang a little strumming together in The Slope of the Heart Sits, which immediately made the auditorium run.
"I'm glad that you were interested in the song, which did not surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek replied.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, I recognized in the performance by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with a huge applause, Hana Hegerová was reminded of the song Dad liked Lida Baarová even with Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s explanation about the communist ban and the replacement of Baarová by the American actress West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the song Sebastián, and Segrado sang the beautiful song Prague, performed by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zamków and former Kolínák.
But that was the conclusion, standing applause and an addition in the form of an optimistic song We are living in a wonderful time.
There was another addition to the playlist, but the fans did not applaud it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the four of them sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also an older CD, Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek of his books and even the cover of the legendary LP and took a photo with any interested parties.
Berdych with <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek will be supplemented by Rosol and Hájek
For the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia nominated non-playing captain of the Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navratil four Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Berdych, Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czechs defend the trophy, but they are going to play on the opponent's field in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from November 15 to 17.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in five years.
"We know we're on hot ground, it's going to be wild and we have to focus on our performance as always."
"We're going there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek, the builder of the winning point in last year's final against Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya, and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
U.S. Command in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have shown exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary buzz, threats, and millions of statements, airplanes were sent out, hitting the target and returning.
They will not be belittled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of confused and bigoted, actions unsupported by Obama’s Syrian policies.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis were bombing.
Do not be fooled by the media's claims that a "Syrian base" or "Hezbollah supplies" was bombed.
Recently I wrote here that while U.S. assistance to secular insurgents in the country remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia cheerfully continues to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was a fresh delivery of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakia that became the target of Israeli airstrikes.
A clear message.
And notice, Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the insurgents, although according to popular Internet theories it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government has honored two members of the special forces, presumably the Delta Force.
Until now, it was not known that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
There is a known heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city, in my opinion they were members of a secret CIA command, which is made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA’s elsewhere located residence.
It's clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its own machine-gun-protected offices in Libya (it was on one of them that both SEALs members died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of the US command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, along with five private contractors, fired their way to the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is embarrassed by the fact that during that attack the commando was not officially deployed and was simply hesitant about what to do.
The Commander-in-Chief, without orders, is likely to release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that U.S. commands, CIA agents and private contractors operate in the country not once, but permanently is quite interesting information.
This is due to the fact that until recently such a thing was not officially admitted, and even now there is only talk of a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the United States is half-heartedly trying to fight terrorism in Libya.
Although much more help would be needed to resolve the national situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised Iran’s air force for chasing American drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you accidentally manage to discover your drone in airspace, there is nothing you can do about it.
However, if an Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that an Iranian F-4 Phantom aircraft was chasing an American drone in international space over the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American superfighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew the Phantom to optically verify its armament without the Phantom having detected it on radar or simply spotted it, and then when he suddenly showed up and called the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without murmuring.
Not surprisingly, the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He's no match for a Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, Rajtoral promises
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been particularly successful in recent times, defender or midfielder Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88> Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the national team after a year.
He is also successful in shooting, exults in activity, after the procedure, a penalty kick was imposed on him in the match in Teplice.
Victoria reached for victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice, but in the end she took one point from these two duels.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that we will defeat Jablonec at home," Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral promises.
The team is carefully preparing for a difficult match with the North Bohemians, who play offensive football.
Everything is aimed at the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent’s game.
"I believe that Friday night will be an excellent match," the Czech representative attracts fans to the stands of Doosan Arena.
Pilsen's last matches did not go as well as she would like, but the word crisis defender Victoria rejects.
That's how it is in football, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes you're in worse shape.
I would not talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again," said the defender of Zapadachech.
The Victoria team will again rely on the support of fans.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans, who are great, with that."
"I believe we will repay them by winning," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Pétová: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, it's a big leap - a leap back a few years, into memories, into my childhood.
It’s a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and wash the dishes, luxure and do your homework.
Although these "duties", it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of parents.
The practice was completely different - to run from school, throw the bag in the corner and run out.
Play with other kids ball games, jump a shot.
Then, during the series, Helena and her boys embroider a festive napkin with a chain stitch for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings to finally wash the dishes, luxuate, in the winter to apply wood in the stove and do the tasks until dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of the tasks to write love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, have a homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not those jams that are sold now, the content of which was not even lying next to strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which my mother and I liked to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio to cassettes, which were playing loudly in the old cassette tape of my mother.
And then we rolled over the tapes on the pencil and played the same song over and over again, our favorite, and toasted each other with a siphon.
Or we were on the phone over the table using cans that were tied together with a string - and while we were at the phone call to hear each other better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, then the handle was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live from it in such a way that nothing was lacking.
We didn’t need any of those iPhones, iPads, or even cell phones and laptops or branded clothing.
Clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best "approach" to the wardrobe was a batik t-shirt made by home with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics, we were satisfied with the above-mentioned mother's cassette and Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which, by the way, we used only on the train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, don't be mad, or as I have already said, go "only" out.
When I was a little older, we put a video player under the tree, my parents certainly saved a long time for it, but unfortunately it did not warm up with us for a long time.
My younger sister stuffed a strudel into it, said to have tasted the tapes so beautifully, so she tried to see if he could sleep with the strudel.
Unfortunately, he did, but it was his last bite.
Well, that's what he still has, poor thing, on his daddy's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she stuffed a strudel into the video and thought that she would play the recipe and didn’t play it, so she still can’t bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate, to communicate without a cell phone, without a computer.
My sister and I made arrangements with the granddaughter of the neighbors during the holidays at my grandmother's house, when we would meet again next summer at my grandmother's house - and so it was, so it was.
We got together.
Promise yourself that you’ll see each other next year?
I also remember the winter when the whole village and I were running outside, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill by the church on hay-filled sacks.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear the notorious phrase, “Wash your hands!” before every dinner.
Yes, this is true even today, but you certainly do not have lemon soap tied to the faucet in your bathroom.
After dinner, when my father was in the garage "working" at a beer with Jarda from the village, my mother and I lay down on the floor, leaned our feet against the stove, opened the door and looked at the flame, and listened to the crackling of the wood that came from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated – we talked – we didn’t text each other every day via chat rooms, text messages.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew so much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is nice to remember, especially if I supplement these memories by looking at the albums where neatly glued black corners are evoked black and white photos.
And in case I didn’t know how old I was then, the back of the photo is always written year of taking the picture.
I can see that although the cuts were not very good for us according to the pot and we had pants like our cousin two sizes bigger, no one had laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
I'd rather go back to that step forward - to reality.
Until 2013 and I will wait for what the modern times will invent for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me are now for the young adolescent generation at least somewhere "one hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they are losing a lot, that they will not experience this "premonition" time either.
I wish they did!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which holds thousands of patents for the defunct Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, a company it auctioned off in the wake of Nortel’s bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's $4.5 billion patents, has sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of infringing seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps link search terms to relevant ads, according to the lawsuit, which is at the heart of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which competes heavily with Apple’s and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its bid several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the patent battle, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business driven in part by Motorola’s patent group.
“Despite its failure to obtain the patents at auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to infringe them,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because, according to the lawsuit, the patent was intentionally infringed by Google.
Miloslava Cejpková: The November Smile
It came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she put aside her smile, one that she kept displaying as a defense against the supposedly friendly environment.
That was a relief for her, because it was a mask she decided not to put off in public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she was a grandmother and had grandchildren Elinka or Adíka around her.
And of course, when her sons called.
She remembered the lesson of the endless courses of business skills very well.
Now they've finally come in handy.
So as not to grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew to the corner.
Like a disguise at a costume show.
November, or any other month, can't do that miracle to make her really smile, like when they were on a trip with the one who hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt announces first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi has taken the inaugural oath, but his triumphant day will hardly put an end to the political unrest in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was inaugurated as the country’s first freely elected president, after Husni Mubarak, who had been ousted 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He swore an oath in front of 18 judges dressed in black talars in a mansion built overlooking the Nile that resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are working for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of fierce attacks by individual governments for most of its 84 years as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small convoy of cars, hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pomp of the Mubarak period, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the column could pass through the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs in the south.
Morsi’s personal prestige, ridiculously referred to as the Muslim Brotherhood’s non-charismatic “reserve tyre,” has risen sharply since his victory and Friday’s speech aimed at presenting him not only as an Islamist candidate, but also for all those who want to end the rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said, wearing a blue social suit and a red tie in a wooden chamber where he was sworn in.
Morsi later traveled to the University of Cairo to deliver his inaugural speech.
While standing alert, he received an official welcome from a military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the chanting “the army and the people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of the Islamic student movement.
Morsi took a symbolic oath Friday in Tahrir Square, where the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year was born, and vowed to retake the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council that took them from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to make an official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he yielded to the will of the army, indicating that the struggle for power would continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghettos there will probably be police specialists, to ease tensions
In ghettos in the Czech Republic, police specialists should work in the future.
They would spend up to half of their tours here.
They'd be overseeing order and solving problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior is counting on this.
According to him, to improve the situation in the country would mainly help "accelerated provision of social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
About 80,000 people lived there, mainly Romani people.
Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
Bullish usury.
According to experts, the problem areas in the meantime have increased by a hundred.
Relationships between their residents and others are tightened.
Anti-Roma marches were held in several places.
People from the surrounding area also joined the extremists.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police in areas with ghettos to maintain security and order.
A key condition is "consistent application of equal access in law enforcement".
However, this is impossible to achieve without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
The specialist would go on errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he'd be overseeing order.
He would also know the locals, so he could solve problems or offenses better.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a wide range of illegal acts," the Interior Ministry said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive surcharges of 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers in troubled areas should be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations started this year, a detailed proposal is now being prepared.
The project is expected to run until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded locations is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the report's authors said.
How many specialists there should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will identify the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release for these officers after the end of the project every year.
According to the project proposal, the selected police officers will first undergo an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should go through this training each year.
These will be the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special training for police officers who will operate in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the ideas of the interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with well-defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would have social dwellings that would be comparable to ordinary housing.
The tenants would have to comply with an integration plan drawn up with them by social workers.
They would have to follow the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send their children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would advance to a higher standard of living.
According to the interior, the permeable housing system should operate for at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in a pro-integration-motivated environment".
The model of social housing is prepared by departments for local development and work.
They are due to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhlí<0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Carboniferous Hill is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with several others, evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník at the time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruptions were at the beginning of the Quaternary.
Viewed from a greater distance, the white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Pomocna, built in the years 1755 - 1765, stands on the top of Uhlí<0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch.
It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn next to the church did not survive.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley of four rows of linden trees, about 1 km long, was planted.
The crossroads on Uhlí<0xC5><0x99>ská vrch is already the third version, the original was here after 1916, the second, from 2001 lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden sculptures made by the local art carver Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Nedomlel.
He used different types of trees from the Low Jeseník region.
Similarly, the pedestals of rocks from the area form an interesting geological exposition.
At each stop, the name of the sponsor is also indicated.
The Coal Hill is a remnant of a young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric age measurements vary slightly, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudny (aged 3.3 million years) and older than the Venus Volcano (aged 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born from an explosion.
It ejected a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the substrate, which became reddish-brown when burned.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption erupted red, brown-red and sometimes black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters, and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tuffs are noticeable volcanic bombs up to 1 meter in size. The second eruption ended with a lava eruption.
At the end of the activity, lava flowed out of the volcano, which today forms a powerful layer of slag basalt up to 50 m.
Volcanoes in which volcanic ash eruptions alternate with lava flows are the most common type of volcano.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone gradually underwent erosion.
However, he was threatened only by the extraction of rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in 1953 - 1962.
Tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mining was stopped under pressure from experts and the public, thus preserving this unique place.
The problem, however, is the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which quickly weather, decay and slide down the slope.
The fracture disappears quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
Correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites.
You can get to Uhlí<0xC5><0x99>ská vrch by a green tourist sign from Bruntál or from Silesian Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ov.
Motorists can use the free parking at the beginning of the lime alley, where a short educational trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel house.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts in O<0xC5><0x99>echovka.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move with a small severance payment.
Therefore, Ivana was quickly looking for an alternative housing for herself and her then-older mother.
From friends she got a tip for apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the vast forest park and the dam on the other side excited me," Ivana remembers from the first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a three-year temporary.
"We have lived here for more than thirteen years now, and not only because of gradual reconstruction I would not change," adds the owner.
At that time, the mother and daughter moved from a 120-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2, and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The action was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be made, such as painting the doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner knocked down the core, but the owner was most annoyed by the impractical and unnecessarily large hallway, and vice versa a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to delineate the individual zones and divide the room, which allowed for a new location of the lights.
The first thing she decided to do after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step towards a partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of PVC floors with laminate floors.
Ivana didn't know how to use the bathroom.
For years, I've been subscribing to housing magazines and looking for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On the recommendation, I approached a young architect Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rová.
"It was actually the most important step for the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was possible to modify the available hallway at the same time.
The architect combined the space of the toilet and bathroom, and replaced the two doors with opening wings with one sliding one, thus saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also barrier-free enough.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, in the toilet bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Doudérová continued.
As part of the program How to build a dream, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin <0xC4><0x8C>en<0xC4><0x9B>k also participated.
In the space created by combining two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, a dining room, a living room and a sleeping room, without using the classical principles of optical partitioning, for example, half-spans or Japanese walls.
"As a result, this would violate the openness and uniformity of the space," explains the architect.
It was possible to separate the sleeping and living areas in an original way.
All you had to do was turn your back on the two sofas and put a custom-made duvet box between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and the paintings.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used a high-quality marmoleum, the sliding door was revived with wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette, if necessary, is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new anti-allergic marmoleum floor has a number of advantages over the laminate floor: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of plasterboard niches and ceilings highlighted in color is an example of how you can work with space in the panel house.
I left the colors on the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
"I like orange, the same shade I had in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphene lining with the motif of blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
For a warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which emphasized the modern functional style.
In a small apartment it was possible to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled from a distance.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new one with the older one works perfectly, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier and quality art objects that Ivana has been collecting all her life.
The kitchen was the last to arrive.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect subtracted their numbers and rearranged the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface softens the slightly pearly surface.
A washing machine, a dryer and a dishwasher fit into a small space thanks to an ingenious solution.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived the all-glass cladding of the walls above the worktop.
Unique graph glass with a digital printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is perfectly maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers that reminded her of the favorite neighborhood she had lived in for years.
Now she seems to be happy here.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathtub and washbasin, to the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiles.
The large shower enclosure has Ronal glass doors.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the environment in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We unified the interior materially and colorfully and tried its elegant, cozy, not too crowded appearance.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of everyday items," adds Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rová.
The Supreme Court has ruled that timelessness can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as could also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS deputies Ivan Fuksy, Mark <0xC5><0xA0>najdr and Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>, on the other hand, he decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until they gave up their mandate last November, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knoetig said.
With this decision, the court rejected the proposal of Prosecutor Ivo Istvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the MPs.
According to him, they accepted bribes in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not making it difficult to pass laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to prosecute the former prime minister who offered them these posts.
An Anti-Corruption Police Officer Arrested With Vito Bárta
Bárta's lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of MPs of the Chamber of Deputies, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client also in this matter, but due to the protection of classified facts, I cannot comment further."
According to the Law, the case is handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS).
The tn.cz server said that Bárta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizapravy.cz, the case could be related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment Bárta allegedly sought.
However, the latest information shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
Police Presidium spokeswoman Eva Kropá<0xC4><0x8D>ová declined to comment, saying the case was being handled by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
It is the applicant there who supervises Bárta’s case and, therefore, it is indirectly apparent from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under the regime of secrecy.
The reporter of Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Klasnova in the morning before their residence in Klárov in Prague.
She was just loading her suitcases into the car and leaving.
She declined to comment on the whole incident.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement, Tomio Okamura, spoke about Bart's detention.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
“Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties in our candidate, and as I have repeatedly said before the election, he was not and is not a member of Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tomio Okamura,” he added.
Vít Bárta, who ran unsuccessfully for the Tomi Okamura Movement for the Dawn of Direct Democracy in the Pilsen Region in the recent early parliamentary elections, is known for his corruption case of bribing MPs for Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month delay.
Subsequently, the verdict was changed and Bárta was acquitted of the charges.
I want a contract in the NHL.
Juice, lust and enthusiasm I still have
For Prospal, family has always come first, which is why he wants to submit to her at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he's out of hockey.
"I want to play the role of dad and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite the fact that he is a renowned worker who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can pull off his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," she says resolutely.
The New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and also have two injured supporters - attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like when you join the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have something on paper, it's not worth it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post saying they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere has it ever been confirmed that this has actually happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it is simply not so.
You haven't heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
The point is to get into a situation where the contract really comes.
For example, when a player gets hurt or someone does not succeed and the manchaft does not work.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get the contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York, aren't there?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make it into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
But the second thing is, you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten any yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality I have to live in.
You're going to America on Friday, are you expecting something to go right?
I have the same expectations since July 5, when the free-lance market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
I'm going to Tampa to see my kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
It is because I am a father and a husband, and everything depends on it.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of dad and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday Vasik has two hockey matches, it is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in quotation marks on a full-time basis?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games due to knee surgery.
And I really, really enjoyed it.
One day it will come to such a stage that all the goals, wins and passes will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You’ve had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - in addition to the family - is sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that is where family life comes in.
My children, I'm sorry, our children -- my wife and I -- grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
We would love to see them continue this trend.
Because what we're going to tell ourselves is, in America, the possibilities are all over the place.
That's the chance we should offer them.
Are you planning to stay in the US permanently?
We will continue to practice it as before.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia in Hluboká and around <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
And in the winter again in Tampa or wherever our footsteps take us.
It's perfect to be warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say that I went to meet him, it took a lot of strength and sacrifice, and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who crave this so that they can choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have the will to work hard, train hard, and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
Today, I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have in the NHL, that I am still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay there.
It's unplanned.
So you can say that this season you will wait until it turns out and then decide what to do next?
I'm in a phase where I'm going day by day.
Recently, the CEO of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ announced that he was postponing the decision to build the 3rd and 4th units of the Temelín power plant until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and the approval of Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current CEZ management is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should make a recommendation to the shareholder, not hide behind it.

Police evacuate Los Angeles airport after shooting
Shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport, allegedly terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, said law enforcement officers shot and killed an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, said there had been a shootout that injured two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration.
How many people were injured and whether there were any casualties is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an incident with more people injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
On Thursday, Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported.
The Israeli press widely reported about the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
An Israeli military spokeswoman asked CNN not to comment on the attack.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
According to a U.S. government source, the targets were rockets and related equipment that the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, said that the target of an Israeli airstrike on a target on Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 missiles.
A second Israeli television channel reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles, according to the DPA.
In addition, they reportedly featured SA-3 missile batteries, including a command center with radar to track the missiles and their targets.
According to Israeli television, the missiles have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will target any supply of weapons to Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorists.
Is the internet the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual pre-tax baseline profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, up from $305 million to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half of the year and began the second half of the year with rapid growth, mainly in Australian and British off-road travel.
“To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading for record annual earnings before interest and tax,” he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
Recreational business boomed in Australia during the second half of the year, offsetting the slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreation area, while business clients spent less.
U.S. trade recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to deliver a third consecutive year-round profit.
Flight Centre's shares were up 3 cents yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September to protest planned oil production in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported today by AFP with reference to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
She said the original allegations of piracy had not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a nonviolent action against an oil rig in the Arctic have been transported from a detention facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," Greenpeace said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned relocation.
Environmental authorities first accused the environmentalists of piracy, for which they could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But they announced last week that they would replace the allegations with milder riots, imposing a lower sentence with an upper limit of seven years in prison.
Greenpeace said in a statement that the authorities had not withdrawn the piracy allegations, as they had promised.
This means that the detainees are now charged with two crimes.
The powerful Committee of Inquiry announced last week that it would replace the piracy allegations with those of rioting.
But when 30 prisoners were brought before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not dropped.
Instead, new charges have been brought against everyone," Greenpeace said in a statement.
In mid-September, the Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom’s oil platform.
The ecologists were on board the Arctic Sunrise, which was flying the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they filed an appeal, but the court dismissed them all.
Environmentalists are complaining about the conditions.
Greenpeace chief Kumi Naidoo said the move to St. Petersburg would make it easier for detainees to meet their families and consular staff.
However, there is no guarantee that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they could be worse," he said.
One of the detainees, Faiza Oulahsen, asked King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to speak about their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It says Maliki is a major contributor to the resumption of sectarian violence in Iraq, partly due to fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At least one of Shakespeare’s plays, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards will have to be studied in English literature classes.
The test will also include “hidden text” to motivate deeper reading;
Combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to have a language matriculation exam, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective course.
The Ministry of Education is due to release a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
For other major subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Ofqual office, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new grade system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In a speech last summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “wide consensus on whether we need to reform our exam system to regain the trust of society” and insisted that the graduation exam be “more demanding, more ambitious and more stringent.”
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
In comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year on math, and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive math exam – along with more emphasis on the subject in the scoreboards – is likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Before the elections, a long smoldering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD broke out.
It all came to a head when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, went to court for undemocratic candidates.
However, the actors of the case did not want to express themselves too much, so as not to harm the party even more before the elections.
The votes of the voters are now counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD urged the mayor of Ostrava to step down from the party on Monday evening, and it is likely that he will also press to lose his post.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What is going on in the disputes and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for Diary.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
Surely the CSSD was expecting a much better result.
Did it hurt her in our country that disputes within the party were resolved in the media before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have had a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is now.
It’s a party that has internal problems, it’s internally sick, and people feel that not everything is okay in it.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through a recession for some time now, and unfortunately similar things are happening in social democracy now.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, moved to the people in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and influenced them.
This is related to the fact that the police go to the offices of the Ostrava municipality and collect computers.
This shows that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps also in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>kovci and Sobotkovci.
This too has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a foretaste of what is happening now in Prague.
Hasek's wing gradually took up positions, so that after the election it could create a situation that would weaken Sobotka's wing.
In politics, people sometimes have to make compromises.
However, everyone has some internal boundary, when these compromises can no longer be made, and this is also my case.
Initially, I did not want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> Zaorálek that I would try to get to the regional candidate in order to strengthen Sobotka’s wing as the mayor of Ostrava.
But Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek's wing gave it a stop.
Why do you stand on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek?
Slavek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD program and, to a certain extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I have to admit that I have not heard anything like this from the other side.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can simply begin to recall the chairman of the party.
This is a struggle for power, no matter what, and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek ended his political career with what he has now shown in Prague.
How did you perceive that the Ostrava leadership of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD did not approve you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on a competition to determine which of their members will be ranked.
The competition should be largely based on programmatic visions and on the ability of these people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have much ability or vision, but the political party is an elevator to the money they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is that when these people start to come to the fore because they break the rules without scruples, they break the party statutes.
With their practices, they turn political parties into mafias and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to consider whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties start respecting the statutes.
So, before the elections, did you file a motion to the court for interim measures against the form of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by being able to abolish organizations that do not suit it, purposefully establishing new organizations, gradually throwing out inconvenient party members.
An example is the fact that they wanted to exclude Richard Bedna<0xC5><0x99>ík from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and then they preferred to cancel the resolution on his expulsion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the party’s statutes through the courts is the last option, but at the moment when the other methods and control bodies within the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD have ceased to work, it is the only option.
The leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, headed by MP Adam Rykala, is trying to remove you from your position as mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, has a keen interest in this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything in their power to recall me.
They promise people positions, win votes, and for those votes they consolidate their power in the party.
If I go back in time, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could label me as a person who puts money where it doesn’t belong.
The city has acquired a property that is strategically valuable to it.
How do you feel about your stay as mayor?
The District Committee already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
I think it’s like a thief shouting, “Catch the thief!”
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in Ostrava’s social democracy who would initiate and promote, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a science and technology park.
Still, everything makes me uncomfortable.
I don’t read it any other way than to prevent others from reaching the places they desire.
Will you continue to fight against these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, so must the political parties.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state if it cannot even manage itself.
So I am not considering leaving the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD now, because I think that it is not me who is causing the cancer of this party, but these people who are trying to expel me.
Olomouc will open a public skating rink in the historical centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Spálen<0xC3><0xBD> said that the preparatory work on the ice rink had started on October 26 and an ice production unit was in operation from Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has an area of 375 square meters, the podium occupies 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two stands with punch.
"We have expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire area of the podium is covered so that skaters can comfortably change their clothes," Spálen<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the upcoming Christmas.
Last year, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square to repair the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice area could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate directly in front of the town hall in 2009, when the skating rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural programme, will open on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Eve.

The brutal murder of a senior in the Zlín region will be solved again by the regional court
The Regional Court acquitted a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech man for lack of evidence.
The men denied the guilt.
They face between 15 and 20 years in prison or an extraordinary sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court annulled the decision of the Regional Court and returned the case to him again for consideration.
The judge declined to comment on the grounds that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the young men assaulted a seventy-seven-year-old man in his home.
The senior died an agonizing death.
According to the indictment, he was strangled, beaten and kicked all over his body, and was hit in the head by about three dozen blows with a metal object, apparently a gas pistol.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull bone, brain swelling or bleeding to the brain, which he succumbed to at the scene.
The young men reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the regional court, the only evidence against the defendants were odor traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal instructions.
Smell marks from the crime scene and on other items were consistent with the defendants in more than a dozen cases, but they were initially treated by the police as factual and not as odor marks.
In addition, some mistakes have been made in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants has not been unquestionably proven.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
The dead elderly man with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
Neither of them were alerted to a violent death by an ambulance doctor.
After a few days, the criminals were contacted by Olomouc doctors, who found signs of violent death during the autopsy.
Police were no longer able to work with all the clues from the crime scene that relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Hungary-Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
He is now serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who are responsible for the robbery of a jewelry store.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopn<0xC3><0xBD>.
The younger of the accused in the murder of the elderly man lives in Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins reconstruction of the stadium
In early November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who will rebuild the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages in order to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week of Strings of Autumn
The saxophone giant and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make a point next Wednesday after the 18th Strings of Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform in the Great Hall of Lucerne on November 6 with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation by PKF - Prague Philharmonic under the direction of Martin Kum<0xC5><0xBE>ák.
Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra will include Pegasus from his new album Without A Net, as well as his older tracks Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which proves that the Prague concert at Strings of Autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of artists he worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitou<0xC5><0xA1> and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom they set the course for a new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the last thirteen years, he has performed mainly with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
After the festival, there will be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and the young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles, will present to the domestic audience.
Damková says she is banning UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the arbitration committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing penalties for referees.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview with the newspaper Pravo.
Otherwise, they would be threatened with a penalty.
Damková also refused to side with the football players of Pilsen, where she comes from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of a vote, I can lose 1-6," Damková said in response to the criticism, which was infuriated after Pilsen recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Thus, although the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R has stopped publishing penalties for judges in recent months, Damková assures that the judges are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the panel finds out that the referee made a mistake, it will restrict his delegation, regardless of the match," Damkova said.
According to Damková, the reason why the penalties are not published is the ban imposed by the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and severely punishes violations."
"We are very suspicious and we are looking for something behind every mistake."
"We published the restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, there will be severe sanctions," Damkova said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the disclosures continue, the Commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of arbitrators.
"And they're very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program for the education of judges," Damková added.
Bárta’s detention is related to Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and Bém: Is he behind the wiretapping?
The President of Public Affairs Vít Bárta was arrested by police on Thursday.
Along with him, Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek, the head of the anti-corruption police’s department of analytics and informatics, was arrested.
The arrests are linked to wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the wiretaps, which came to the server Novinky.cz, was confirmed by a trusted source to the Czech Press Office.
The wiretapped phone calls between Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and Béma, published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which the two men address each other as "Mazánka" and "Kolibrík", show Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's influence on the city's actions under Béma's leadership.
They were acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007 and leaked to ABL two years later.
It was owned by Bart at the time.
The server Novinky.cz warned that the detained criminalist Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek moved to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretaps, at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravsk<0xC3><0xBD> of the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are preparing intensively for the forthcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only 8% of companies surveyed said they did not address issues related to both key codes in their company at all.
This is according to a survey by the law firm Ambroz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
With both key codes approaching their effective date, it is only at the last minute that many managers are beginning to realize what a significant impact they can have on the business of their companies.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Due to the labyrinth of politicians, the business sector has long been unsure whether revolutionary changes will eventually occur or not.
“Now, however, they have only a few weeks left for the transition to the new law to take place without complications for their companies,” said Jan Spá<0xC4><0x8D>il, partner of Ambroz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 per cent of companies that are intensively engaged in the new codes, 26 per cent said that their companies have already taken all the necessary measures to be ready in time.
In addition, 35 percent of these companies are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
In contrast, one in five companies has not yet dealt with re-codifications, yet they have a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and are unable to assess the issue.
Only 8% of companies admit that they have not yet dealt with issues related to re-codification.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts for the largest number of companies (21 percent), followed by the settlement of business conditions (16 percent), as well as changes in the cadastre of real estate and liability for damages (ten percent each).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important innovations of the entire codification will take place, namely the unification of the regulation of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which the contract law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom in the arrangement of relations," said Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Poddan<0xC3><0xBD>, lawyer for Ambroz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In connection with the law on commercial corporations, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
The following are topics related to the changes in the convening and the course of the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means a tightening of obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where a company is in danger of going into bankruptcy or going into bankruptcy.
“In practice, this means that if the members of the board of directors and the CEOs of the companies do not act with the care of a proper manager and do not prevent the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefits gained from the performance of their duties only in the last two years,” he added.
Pierre Rainero: I’m trying to make Cartier’s style a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things, so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains Pierre Rainero, Director of Style at Cartier, in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year Award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year contest, you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious over and over again, going to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon’s capital, Yaounde.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he developed a hematoma that caused him problems for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you are not first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwell’s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if doctors could visit Cameroon, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffering, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on weekends, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people cram into vans, attach medical supplies to rooftops, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by luck.
More than once they have to push vehicles through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his broad smile and unbridled energy – is very eager to join in the local cheerfulness.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition," Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different medical care.
Many are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches or donated glasses or a birth certificate for free – a document that many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs a simple operation under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, town hall or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes to a recovery site to free up space for another patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and hygiene equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay up and keep working, they play the drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students – performed 700 surgeries for free last year and is aware that their help can mean a lot to local residents.
One man said he would be able to work again after hernia surgery.
"It will change the future of our family," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that this second work finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when he’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who is a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and works as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it’s a great practice they wouldn’t get at home.
"We washed Dr. Bwell's hands thoroughly and removed blood stains or held his tools," O'Malley said.
You’ll never experience that as a second-year medical student in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for a trip to Cameroon on their own and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive at Yaounde, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation, and study.
"He's a hero, no doubt," O'Malley says.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, constant harnessing is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, ease their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holcát re-established the position of Head Sister for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I think it is essential that this function be clearly defined and formalized so that nurses have a representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves proper attention from the Ministry.
In the exercise of this profession, it is necessary not only high professionalism, but also a human approach and personal convictions.
“I will gladly and with all responsibility endeavor to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses.”
"We have excellent and skillful nurses in our healthcare sector, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients, so that they carry out their profession with all empathy and help us to improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>mídová.
The newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena <0xC5><0xA0>mídová, on the occasion of her inauguration, also said that she wants to deal with various aspects of the nursing position and intends, among other things, to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I do not want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each with their own competencies and together with other health professionals, they form a well-coordinated work team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the practice of nursing, these difficulties I perceive and I intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks burden nurses unnecessarily and take away their time, which they could and should devote to patients," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>mídová.
Other areas that he intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with each other in the team and with the management of health care providers, adjusting competencies, as well as employment issues, such as compliance with the labor code or not overloading nurses with their insufficient number at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous grievances, which, however, are not documented on a specific case where violations of the rules could occur out of fear of possible punishment.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, so the function of the Chief Sister of the Czech Republic in this case could serve as a guarantee of preserving the anonymity of such a complaint and have the relevant authorities investigate the specific case," concludes Alena <0xC5><0xA0>mídová.
Mgr. Alena <0xC5><0xA0>mídová graduated from the Secondary School of Medicine in the field of Nursing (she graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (she graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been working as the Head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical disciplines and recognition of qualifications in the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bed in the internal department, then worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she was the main sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, she has devoted lectures in the field of nursing.
He is not a member of any political party.
So that I won't be silenced by hatred
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, V<0xC3><0x81>CLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Present.
The number of pages comparable to his most famous work Hous<0xC5><0xA5>a (Petrov, 2001) suggests that it will not be a narrow volume.
Another prominent Czech writer of the present – Emil Hakl – spoke for Salon Kahuda.
What made you write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it-- so I wouldn't get sucked into hatred.
To see around him always new clones of this foolish human pettiness, young organisms afflicted by blind selfish endeavors.
I'm not even talking about us, the faces ruined by helpless lust, the souls of the Veslak and the reverse polarized ideologues who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a little mercantile whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my heroic friends, strangers and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning out of life on this planet.
I like to go for walks and then read books at night.
You're talking about loss, hate.
Has there been a breakthrough in the past that has affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The break came a long time ago, at about ten years old.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, I lived after that.
There's still a quiet boy in there.
I see other lone exercisers, each in their own tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I am taking part in this enormous, thousands of years-long movement of the system of life on this planet—the birth of an unfathomable future.
This immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir of our present.
We are the players of a sad and beautiful game where through trial-and-error, another generation of beings emerges, creating some kind of superhuman, artificial intelligence in trillions of interactions per second.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or have you started from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather the dialogue that the right and left sides of the brain hold, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
As periods of peace are interwoven with silently sleeping metastases of wars that may one day awaken, so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I could feel the silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I did nothing, one day it would quietly overwhelm me.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and laid down by layers that are stored in the darkness "below the level of consciousness."
The neocortex, the gray cortex, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient rings of the brain tree.
He talks to furry beasts, asks snakes, seeks the answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express the ego metaphorically – could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to a constantly changing presence, in a relentless effort to name and understand their surroundings and decode important messages.
Occasionally, there are congestion disturbances.
Analogously - as if you "fallen" your PC, from a speech emulator program and a foreign language translator you would get entangled first in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarts ended up at the dark green flashing screen of Bios, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about, I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the current functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there is a gap.
As Nietzsche said, “He looked into the abyss so long that the abyss looked into him.”
Pure feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, psychologically "die" and a new quality enters.
Why do I care about it personally?
I answer with a parable.
Once one fell into a sink and drowned, days, months and years passed, he was still drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a "diver".
Hopefully someone will help some sentence I wrote, as Hrabal's texts helped me once.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word and sentence formulation."
From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo's submarine, ran through Stinadle in dark streets.
In the end, too, behind all the ramifications of the authors and their message, it reads: "The bright sun of the other worlds of Karel Hynek Mácha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On the retrospective that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, perhaps years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are in fact "lives" or rather "worlds."
They are encoded in characters of letters, they carry the experience, the history of the regions of the language.
At any time, we can awaken them to life by letting their sentences flow into the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
This is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book is published, as usual, a chain of author’s readings awaits you.
I remember you used to like to read.
Do you feel happy again, or do you feel differently after years?
I'd rather just tell it today.
And what did I find out?
There are smart people everywhere.
Their basic character - they are inconspicuous, do not pay much attention to each other, they have a friendly radiance, you do not feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>erven<0xC3><0xBD> Kostelec there was (and I hope it is still alive) a curly bookstore (it is appropriately called <0xC4><0x8C>ervenka), a cheerful buddy and a good girl bull.
During one piaty, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Housing.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a shredded, read copy of my book.
In embarrassment, I set aside the morning gloom I had just read, and cried briefly as a man.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and weeping drunkenly.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't stand it and leapt from the window into the snow.
It was downstairs.
We ran out into the night landscape and were captured by the happy rage of the sensitive, the aching soul of the countrymen and the sorrow of the fallen patriots - howling and moaning like werewolves until the morning.
Each book is formally and substantially different from the previous ones.
Is this also true of the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one country beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his novel Sukhodol, Ivan Bunin puts into the mouth of a folk healer the words of an old Russian myth: At sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a bitch lying there with a gray chest on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we were the devils in hell a long time ago, drawing lots to see what role we would play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to let it go again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, like the movement of continents on a planet, affects our desires from such depth and breadth that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so we are acting with absolute certainty exactly in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded by the influx of dopamine, endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Occasionally, there's a breakdown, and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the shore of the ocean of the unconscious and in a leaky sail made of a dirty handkerchief catching tides of damp wind.
I have to write to be human.
Obama withdraws from health care
After a wave of criticism yesterday, President Obama backed away from his often-repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Citing hundreds of thousands of notices from providers, Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama withdrew from his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
Given what he called the “media turmoil” about the statements, Obama urged the Americans who received the announcements to look for new insurers in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration says it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
“I’m telling these Americans frankly: you deserve better,” Sebelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
Annoyed, Sebelius uttered this sentence, caught on the microphone, yesterday to the adviser sitting behind her at yesterday’s Committee meeting, which took place after a tumultuous exchange with Republican Billy Long, a Missouri deputy, about whether she herself must get involved in the Obama program.
For more than three hours during the hearing, Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance and purchased a program through HealthCare.gov that is now imposing on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you be talking to next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from the agencies and from behind the scenes, they are already hand in hand.
The transaction is expected to be announced in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for LTE networks, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications, the company launched an auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to the general surprise, until then, the taste of the company to penetrate the telecommunications was not talked about.
But Sazka is now headed by a very experienced telecommunications tycoon Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing director of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), later became the director of Slovak T-Mobil and last headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now admitted that she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it gives logic.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers to its network from its own virtual operator.
Under normal circumstances, Vodafone would not like this, but according to Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny, it could be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between rival operators O2 and T-Mobile, which will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
That could be Sasuke.
If it succeeds in the tender for LTE networks (as a newcomer can auction a specially designated spectrum), Vodafone does not have to enter the auction at all, or he will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will release Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or the newly built 900 MHz LTE network), allowing the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building a costly LTE network that Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The money saved could then be spent by Vodafone on some provider of fixed Internet or cable TV.
What about Kellner?
By acquiring the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech branch), he would immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a big moth that will wait for restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would have acquired the LTE networks already for O2 and very likely in cooperation with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already announced that they will be sharing the network.
Thus, the auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business versus global giants.
Will Czech Television ever do without signing events?
It has entered the era of President Zeman with a legendary scene with an ashtray, so it is not difficult to listen to complaints that gather evidence of the castle’s company.
In the past, no one has documented the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík in this way, let alone to sign it.
True, the editors took the lead.
However, the described cases do not answer the question of where such a preference of some journalists for Zemanites comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or, to avoid using vulgarism, a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathic accommodatingness.
And assuming a general rottenness, we cannot forgive ourselves the question of whether other, no less unscrupulous, power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity, do not seek to change the conditions of television.
Those who say that there are no obvious attempts to intervene by politicians in broadcasting in developed countries are right.
However, the truth is also that this does not mean that there are no complaints about the public service media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be a tendency inherent in them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven’t reached this stage of civilization yet, and this situation is not here.
But perhaps in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of the blurry situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings collide.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the verge of power
It is almost a rule that at key moments in the country the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill his state duties.
If T. Masaryk had been physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidency and the events around Munich would have been a little different.
We probably wouldn’t have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly across the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight hard for its legitimacy.
Above all, the nation would not have had a hangover from that surrender to this day.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> was not a statesman and he was still in shape during Munich, but during the war things started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
Had he been a little better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
He was elected on the grounds that “the president will not be put in a position to make decisions.”
But he had to, although it was probably not a big decision with a knife on Hitler's neck in the chancellery.
Until the last days of March 1939, the head of the intelligence service, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Moravec, said what should be done so that the occupation, which he knew exactly on the day, would not go so smoothly and with such a profit for the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, neither believed him nor feared him.
Gottwald had his old comrades executed as Moscow had ordered him to do.
Ludvík Svoboda made his participation in normalization completely impossible and had to be deposed, already completely senile.
The fact that Husák was a helpless and sick depressed old man in November 89 made it easier, but that is the only good thing.
Havel was fortunate not to have met him in office in recent years, being spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, many of his deeds suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks what he looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the country.
Or maybe it's a threat, it just doesn't look like it.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is not (historically) good that the president is not entirely in power.
But this is not normal.
Couldn't we elect a president in this country once again with an acceptable mind and an acceptable health?
Distant planets, black-and-white movies, or a bit of fantasy about extraterrestrial life on Earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw in vain.
In terms of his quartet, which will conclude this year’s Strings of Autumn festival in the large hall of Lucerne on November 6, everything has to do with everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of the musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues have to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, the newly-eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, the winner of nine Grammys, the former teammate Miles Davis and today probably the greatest living jazz saxophonist - does not like to explain.
He does not talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my 80s, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is to let life surprise you.
“Too many people plan everything and then get disappointed when things turn out differently,” Shorter says.
How Insects Raise Sales at a Paris Bar
You may be grumpy about insects and not know that you eat about half a kilogram of them every year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are definitely trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you also have a unique experience.
Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar, placed the offer of insects first on the menu of his establishment in Paris in early October.
The bar, inspired by William Burroughs’ Naked Lunch, is located in the fashionable 18th arrondissement near Montmartre.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can taste not only various larvae, grasshoppers or water bugs, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packaged deliveries (so that the insects do not damage their wings, twist their legs or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it is common elsewhere.
The owner of a Parisian bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons why you should eat insects.
The first is the ecological benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finances, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"Moreover, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just passing on a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be delighted with the idea of eating a beetle decorated with pesto, but the reaction of the customers of the Paris bar to the served insects is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics will eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest bites and then choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Union of Entrepreneurs in the Construction Industry in the Czech Republic Václav Matyá<0xC5><0xA1>: The new green economy should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been struggling with a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the lack of interest of the state in solving the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measure, will save considerable amounts on heating, but also for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
For every billion invested, more than 2,700 new jobs will be created.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state there are significant leverage and multiplication effects, it is also one of the most important measures for growth.
Therefore, the Association of Entrepreneurs in the Construction Industry in the Czech Republic fundamentally disagrees with the Government’s resolution and calls for the implementation of such steps that would allow further continuation of the program, so that further calls could be announced within its framework.

The dog summed up the carpet, the president stumbled and ended up on crutches

In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry hinted at softening the U.S. defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying in an unprecedented admission that in some cases, espionage “has gone too far.”
The Secretary of State also acknowledged that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as “autopilot” in view of the furious revelations about NSA espionage activities made by whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The leaked information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry said in a video link at an open government conference in London: “There is no doubt that the president and I and others in the government really learned about some of the things that inertia did because there was that possibility, with reference to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, 9/11.
He became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that abuse has occurred.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was committed to good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow up people and attack governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed, because we can already know about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are preparing to go to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad about alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans that they need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about their threats to stop participating in counter-terrorism organizations because they were disappointed in watching the National Security Agency (NSA).
"It is really important for the national security interests of the United States that Europe stays with us in the same boat, with a view to joint efforts in the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs.
And I'm headed to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism regardless of their anger over the NSA's programs.
Reports in the media that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some US allies, even though the agency’s chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended allied espionage as necessary, saying it was a common matter on both sides.
In the midst of the turmoil, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year, hoping that members of both parties and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other lawmakers who intend to participate will be published.
He said the program is still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the goal of the trip was to help mend relationships, he added that "well-meaning educational measures" would also be in place.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they have used for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realize the fact that we are not the only ones doing espionage here,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry is on his way this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the animosity generated by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Thai Prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket after falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially indicted on June 15 by a provincial court on the island of Phuket on false charges when she told Thai police that the taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly detained her, assaulted her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, an industrial television footage later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Phuket Island police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in an adult women’s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked the Canberra Department of State for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was “extremely worried” about their daughter’s fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously it's a difficult time, but we hope they will return to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia indicate that in the meantime she was spending holidays in the Krabi recreation area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to legal proceedings that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in an adult prison.
But after the recent murder of Australian travel agency employee Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to fix a bruised image for tourists, which may have just been behind the acquittal.
He joked, "A golem from a break?
He got a puck in the defensive zone and no one caught him.

"After watching this video, the director of the Czech Railways contacted my agent Peter Svoboda and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!"
They say we're a lot alike.
I guess I'm gonna have to quit my night training just to keep up the pace.
"I'm afraid the Minister of Defense might come forward and want to advertise the jets!" he added.
New Jersey won their second straight win.
"And most of all, you've noticed - the treatment by Maria Rottrova works," Jagr concluded.
Instead of post-election candle post-election stew
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a bunch of losers.
These are not only the parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD due to their internal split.
Politicians served us post-election stew instead of a festive candlestick on the weekend.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s movement, which promised voters to change the current political style of government, became the leap forward.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party is recorded by the political will of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
The president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, but there are still a few ways to get him back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the Czech Social Democratic Party (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) is distancing itself from the chance to get the prime minister’s seat in my eyes, the entrepreneur Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is getting closer.
The post-election development is still miles away from the early and smooth formation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the leftist government of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD supported by the communists, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Due to the loud resistance of the ANO to get together with the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the coalition of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO and KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL (a total of 111 deputies).
Given the split in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which has thus become an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations can be quite depressing for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The minority government of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD composed of "aliens" in the Castle is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD participates will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further splits within the party.
So I ask myself, "Aren't we going to have another early election?"
The next election would rather be a referendum on the strength of the ANO electoral mandate.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s plans to introduce sectoral taxes, to increase income taxes more significantly or to build a state-owned bank have hopefully fallen under the table.
The parties <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL and <0xC3><0x9A>svit, on the other hand, agree, for example, on the promotion of entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the promotion of employment of disadvantaged persons, reduction of the lower VAT rate on selected goods.
Friction surfaces are most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
YES, but now it is at the top, so the program of the most likely coalition YES, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL would lean more to the right.
Which, from my point of view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with a tax on everything that still moves in the economy.
