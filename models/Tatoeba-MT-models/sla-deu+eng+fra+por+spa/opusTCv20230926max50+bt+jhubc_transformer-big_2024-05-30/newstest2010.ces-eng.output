Barack Obama will be the fourth President of the United States to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo for 26 hours as the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
He will be awarded a diploma, a medal and a check worth $1.4 million, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of a committee that selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple are then scheduled to meet with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to receive it in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The president does not want to avoid this topic, because he realizes that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
The war effort was further intensified a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasize.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate to charity, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The busy program will then take the president and his wife to a banquet where, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will be invited.
From the beginning, Obama has been rather restrained about the price.
He said, for example, that he feels that he does not fully deserve it.
He also reiterated several times that the prize is not just for him, but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "call to action" for him.
Protector of Nature Accused of Blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police have accused the chairman of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Conservation of blackmail.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, for the withdrawal of appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Conservation is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers Brno does not smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort packaging from drinks, in South Moravian villages you can meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
Set aside a few minutes before you find a suitable garbage can.
I don’t mean to say that waste is not classified at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that for being the second largest city in the republic, the councillors do not care enough about this problem.
Brno is in the forestry league of waste sorting not only because as citizens here we can still throw only paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but above all by the number of dumpsters for such waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a PET bottle into a collector basket?
It's a perfect match, but it takes time and nerves.
The only place I have come across so far is on the Moravian Square opposite Potrefená Husa.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but it doesn't seem like much.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste sorting.
Many of my friends prefer not to sort the waste.
Laziness.
They are far away from the garbage.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw away a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colorful dumpsters in sight on Kounicova Street.
Luckily, I came to the right place on the way to the shawl.
The rubbish, however, overflowed from it.
After all, this is still the center of Brno, which probably represents the city the most, isn’t it?!
But ecology and some aesthetics probably do not interest the Brno socialists very much.
The city would rather buy an extraliga hockey league, which would disgrace us all over the country, than buy a couple of extra containers and offer to sort other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption after a while of browsing on the Internet and official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is indeed the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for pensions and sick leave
After the left added farmers or officials to the budget, despite the government’s opinion, there may not be money for pensions, sick leave or building savings.
But also on interest on the national debt or on international litigation.
This will create problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for a raise for some groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave to be borrowed by the government. "It's just putting off problems for the future, laying mines," says Janota.
More and more interest is paid on borrowed money and must be paid back sometime.
The state has no choice where to take it.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
People don’t have to worry about pensions or sick leave, which have lost 1.8 billion dollars.
However, at the cost of the state getting more indebted – next year it will not be only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janot, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the transfer of money to several groups of voters, next year there will also be a shortfall of five billion for the construction of highways and railways.
These are mostly already competitive and dismantled sections, which can not be redesigned and possibly discounted.
At most to preserve, which is also not free.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major construction projects, and the drawdown of European money is also at risk, Karel Hanzelka, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport, warned.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed that the loss of money would be solved in a salamounic way – it would reach for the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which the state owns for the most part, and add to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, let alone a bottomless source.
Last year, $18 billion went into the budget.
Every year, dividends pay for the liquidation of environmental damage, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
In addition, under EU rules, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
However, the Carnival of Transition does not end there.
Nearly $3 billion was spent in the budget on various compensations for victims of communism and crime, or on expenses for litigation, even on building savings.
If the state can do without this money, it is not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the ministry or, in the worst case, reach for the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already launched two-billion-dollar Treasury project, which is supposed to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities spend on.
The first phase will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a single button.
Revealed plans sound promising.
With just one keystroke, you can transfer from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
VMware, an American company that focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers, is aiming for this option.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which simultaneously ran Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains afflicts hoteliers
Bare slopes are not only a concern for mountain lifters.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That is why in the Giant Mountains you can still find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our site.
People go through the offers, find out the prices, but so far they are afraid to order bindingly.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this Christmas will be on the snow or on the mud," said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Who wants a New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly as he wants, he should not hesitate with the order.
Who prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is second only to him, he can still try to wait a few days.
<0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC5><0xA0>pindler
I think they'll try to turn them in for a while, but then they'll let it go and go for a shorter time.
And then the vacant rooms will quickly run out," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates are still offered by the Vrchlabí travel agency Ingtours.
What we're most interested in right now is the Christmas week, which hasn't sold out yet.
Half of the seats in our offer are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," Ingtours director Petr Schiefert said.
New Year's Eve in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e Mountains can still be offered by the Vrchlabí travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February go well for sales, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will be sold out as well,” says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou are slightly better than last year.
We are about five percent better.
We have the last few places for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January and it is selling well in February as well," said Karel Rada, the director of the best hotel in Pec.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are occupied by the hotel Omnia near the central parking lot in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the other hand, half of the beds in the newest Janská Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> hotel are still available at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which we already have about sixty percent occupied at the moment.
February is a little weaker so far, but once the snow hits, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will surely increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
For now, however, the hoteliers of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e Mountains have to let go of their taste for more snow.
It is supposed to cool on Thursday, if there is any precipitation, the mountains should be snowy.
But then the warming will come again, said Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the Hradec Králové office of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It is ridiculous how hard Barack Obama, a president with a reputation for being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered the dumbest, in the Afghan question.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it from Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate even to use the title of Bush's January 2007 declaration as the title of his own declaration: "A new way forward".
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to a civil war-torn Iraq as an “irresponsible and catastrophic decision.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only one possible and highly successful, so much so that there is no mention of Iraq in the news today.
It did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively left his successor with a much more grateful starting position than one might expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the hesitant shooters at the White House, despite subordinate customs.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so at least he cheated the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to squeeze out the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic thing about Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as little as 18 months and to end the process in three years.
Many doubt that a halved increase will yield the same fruit as the Iraq process.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is marked by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied on and no agreements are respected.
Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing masters every day as they please, are poorly prepared under these conditions.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain just a Potemkin village, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the vagueness of the situation, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even building an “accessible state”, which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, does not seem very realistic.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy strikes with its voluntarism.
The situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated over the past eight years and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent to the war turmoil for the purpose of "swift return home" will work a miracle here, can only a truly romantic soul, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in combat operations in Afghanistan is dwindling.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy relates to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and heightened sanctions do not impress the Iranians, the United States will face an overwhelming question as to whether or not to try to resolve the problem by military force.
It will have to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will proceed to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election, and therefore there is enough time left for him to come up with another strategy if this turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash rewards
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not be paid in cash this year.
This was announced by the company, which reacts to harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, which will be available to sell no sooner than five years from now.
In addition, the shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has been the target of criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion in prizes in the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the company’s total remuneration for this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political issue in many countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that bankers' bonuses in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately <0xC2><0xA3>712,000) will be charged a one-off 50% tax.
Similar steps are being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines except physics.
A record five women in Stockholm today received from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden this year’s Nobel Prize in Science and Literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The Chemistry Prize went to Israeli Ada Jonatha, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for their work on the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics was Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic administration.
The only professional category that did without a holder this year was physics.
The prize was awarded to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each recipient received a diploma, a Nobel Medal and a certificate of financial reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million CZK) for each category.
If there are more than one of them, the reward is divided among them.
The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to US President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award, as he is just at the beginning of his career, and in addition, he is the leader of a country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defense of his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janot, who is considering staying in the government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for next year, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps Janota’s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to discuss his next term with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget law, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
On Wednesday, however, the House approved proposals from the left to move money and increased money for salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed Social Democracy’s proposals for secretly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the left on one side and the government, Klaus and the right on the other side, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen, due to which a question mark is being raised about the further work of Fischer’s official cabinet, which was agreed to be formed in the spring by the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially liquidates the austerity package the Fischer government pushed through in the fall, which it says is meant to stop the state’s debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget law, said at a discussion breakfast with businessmen that politicians had been neglecting the “serious problem” of the “unsustainable deficit” of public finances for a long time.
He no longer thinks there is a good solution.
Improvements could only be brought by a strong government, which, moreover, could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, the president believes.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget is frightening and the government should consider further existence.
Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, Deputy Chairman of the ODS, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words “strong statements.”
The head of the Czech Social Democratic Party, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek, responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year, which will exceed CZK 200 billion, is frightening.
On Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD declared the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also pleased.
Mandela starred Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood novel
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories despite some criticism that the main roles are portrayed by American actors.
The story is about sport, race and Nelson Mandela.
A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story is represented by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 91-year-old Mandela asked him if he could play him in an Eastwood film.
Matt Damon also plays an important role.
I told him, ‘If I play you, I’ll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won an award for his role in Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby, has played the leader of the slave-abolishing movement, a fictional president of the United States, and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who is as alive and as important as Mandela to many people.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela’s story on the screen.
I had no other goal but to play this role in such a way as to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
Most importantly, he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I squeeze your hand, I take your energy, it transfers, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, who is dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it for me, and the first thing I said to Françoise Pienaar in my life was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their actual masterpieces under the direction of Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated received positive reviews, and there is talk of Oscar ambitions.
Film critic Todd McCarthy told the Daily Variety: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the glow over Norway unraveled: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile, dubbed the "Bulava" type, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests did not have the proper effect on the success of the test flights.
The bulava usually did not take off at all or was damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers refer to “Bulava” as a “missile that does not fly”.
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights up
This 13th attempt was normally done at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that the equipment was damaged again.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, the Bulava was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows to fire from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a broken "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time, arguing that one cannot speak unequivocally of failure.
The first two stages of the missile survived, and the accident affected only the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Although not a single trial run was completely flawless, only six out of thirteen were considered unsuccessful by the leadership of the Ministry of Defense.
The nearly 50% success rate therefore fills the generals with optimism and thus still claims that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total mass of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again perform in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow in need and will probably play in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulja<0xC5><0xA1> was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to finish some formalities, the AP quoted Moscow club coach Sergei Nemchinov as saying.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of other players, said Nemchinov.
Fetisov will become Russia’s oldest professional ice hockey player if he returns to the ice.
In the NHL, at the age of 51, legendary forward Gordie Howe played the entire season for Hartford, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic golds, seven world titles, the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships in the Soviet Union.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit jersey.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has complied with the unions. Cancel all overtime
The leadership of the automaker Hyundai has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, unions declared a strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, which is essential, that is why a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz wrote that the company of employees who will work the Saturday shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
People will get it back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the company decided to change the way to motivate employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they have to pay an overtime surcharge or they can take an alternative holiday on December 28, and thus extend the Christmas holidays by a day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive a paid fare and lunch.
Due to the fact that overtime was the most urgent and urgent point in terms of comments and complaints of trade unionists and protesting employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for the month of December with immediate effect, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, employees of the automaker were forced to work two hours of overtime every day after an eight-hour shift.
After the signing of the agreement, the unions will withdraw the strike emergency
The next meeting between the company and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the union, Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99>, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the automaker escalated last week, with about 400 employees spontaneously on strike over the constant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged bullying.
The management objected that employees had to make overtime to meet car delivery requirements.
The unions also demanded that workers who stopped production on Wednesday should not be penalized by any sanctions.
In the area of overtime, unions are demanding that the company reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns for it this year.
Hyundai currently employs 2,000 people.
The company launched serial production last November.
It has produced around 80,000 vehicles by September this year, with a current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on 'hardened' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound does not act on the common variant of the virus as strongly as some already available drugs.
AIDS is not curable yet.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of virus multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the Academy of Sciences of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metallocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metallocarborates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists have come up with new ‘enhanced’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to a viral protein.
Metallocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made up of boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms are bound together by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by the cleavage of HIV, mature infectious viral particles would not have formed.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in a tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metallocarborates on a common enzyme variant is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical treatments thus make metallocarborates interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology and Institute of Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry.
The ODS has taken on Fischer, he's defending himself.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year “scary” and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS statements strong statements.
He says he's taking the time to analyze.
Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, Deputy Chairman of the ODS, said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to lean on a minority in the House to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, pointed out Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as.
The House on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments worth more than CZK 12 billion.
The House increased money for salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s criticism of the Social Democracy proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, thus complying with the government’s wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will evaluate the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that if Janota had seriously threatened to leave office in case the amendments were adopted, the situation could have been different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the prime minister on Monday after the government.
He said he was considering staying in office.
This is due to his disappointment with the budget.
If Fischer speaks out for a further fight with the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the nominees of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in the government have nothing to do with the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sick leave, pensions, or an amendment to the Civil Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by ODS are not guilty
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the United States.
He reminded that in several ministries there are people in deputy posts who have voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of combating the level of public deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct that he will lean on the left majority, which is currently in the House".
He said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn’t think about it, and when it is up to date, I will focus on it, Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated by the Civic Democrats to the government, told reporters in the House.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for a European Council meeting.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS resigned.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as also stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday, unless the Prime Minister explicitly asked the Civic Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he then answered the question whether the ODS was burdened by the absence of the party chairman in the parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
Already when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the bolshevism of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
Under the new <0xC4><0x8C>D rules, fewer trains will run for almost the same fare
From December 13, Czech Railways will abolish or restrict some less busy fast trains and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of the new timetable as compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava will get more connections to the capital, the tracks will add one set of pendolino to this track.
On the other hand, the high-speed train will stop going to Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, and direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be significantly reduced.
From the regions, the railways are planning the largest reduction in traffic in the Hradec Králové Region, a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice are also cancelled and the operation of several high-speed trains on the route Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice is limited to some days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovice has to transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
Passengers will no longer travel to Bratislava by pendolin from December 13.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more
Fast cars are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, to pay for the so-called proven losses will give the railways next year four billion crowns, as well as this year. Locals order the regions, in total they will pay eight billion crowns next year, while less than three billion will contribute to the regions by the state.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The railways have a new ten-year contract for local and express trains, so far the contract was always for one year.
The tracks praise the system, and therefore apparently did not raise the price of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will be made only for one-day network tickets of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and cheap internet tickets of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will be based on the distance traveled, so far it was uniform for the journey between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Filipino militants still holding more than 50 people, children released
Armed men have kidnapped 75 people in southern Philippines, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostages as human shields to escape police.
Local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the extradition of the remaining hostages.
The militants are part of the New People's Army (NPA), an armed force of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the kidnapper was initially pursued by police for violence that required settlement between two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, martial law has been declared due to the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Thirty journalists were among the victims of the November 23 election-related massacre.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao.
They resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (official title in Czech is Invictus: The Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela, will be released.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, who was said to have been chosen by Mandela for his portrayal years ago.
The male side role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film in cinemas, they arise from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mwes, South Africa.
He was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1988, and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, along with de Klerk.
He was the President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup in South Africa are at the peak, but at the same time the media are shaken by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, reviews of the new film in South Africa have so far been positive, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the main roles by "spoiled" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and was well prepared for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to - as they say - draw on his energy, he said in an interview after the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can use the film to recall Mandela’s personality and message.
It is the story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the jersey of the national rugby team
Based on a book by British writer John Carlin, with the loosely translated title In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela, the play that gave rise to the nation portrays a South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Throughout the film, Morgan Freeman tries to bring together two racial and long-defined groups of the population, and as Nelson Mandela did in 1995, he plays the South African national rugby jersey on the pitch of the World Cup, which South Africa won.
For entering the lawn in a jersey that is considered almost sacred in South Africa, Mandela received a big ovation from a predominantly white audience fourteen years ago and gained the acclaim of the white population.
Football may be able to reunite people into one nation, said Chester Williams, who was the only black player on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve is yet to be seen.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as exemplified in a recent interview with LN by a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsk, a transformer is burning for tens of millions of crowns
In the morning, the transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps in the substation near the village of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lou<0xC5><0x88>ská caught fire.
According to the spokesperson of the <0xC3><0x9A>stí Region Fire Department, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, six units were involved in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted the transformer to burn out, but later they reconsidered and the fire was extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical fault, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatová, the accident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be possible to quantify it exactly only after the end of the fire.
The destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one.
In ten years of operation of <0xC4><0x8C>eps, nothing similar has happened, defects of this type are rare, she added.
The supply of electricity was not interrupted, according to <0xC4><0x8C>EZ spokeswoman Soni Holingerová Hendrychová, the operation of households, authorities and companies was not affected by the fire of the substation.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive operator of the transmission system, 400 kV and 220 kV electrical lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and a 4,339-kilometre-long line route.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura filed a criminal complaint for defamation of three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD governors
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, will file a criminal complaint today for defamation of three social-democratic governors.
To Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík from the Olomouc Region.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura said this in Twenty Minutes of Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The lawsuit relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
In the end, all regions signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors are attacking us and talking about the fact that we choose raisins, while we have brought an offer only for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
This is for slander against the Student Agency, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
At the same time, he said that he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken their actions in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers the filing of a criminal complaint as a further continuation of Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for his company and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my and my county, and I will call on other governors to do the same.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clearly shown that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, said Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it will invest several million crowns in advertising, which will warn about the unfavourable step of the regions.
He told Radiomagazine that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and did not issue tenders for the order of around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such an act is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train traffic in the regions, according to him, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>urov was also threatened by a deputy for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know who the master is, I will not say his name, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today.
Vaccination against pneumococcus will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcus since January will break established habits.
It should be the first for families free and at the same time optional.
But there are already voices that mandatory vaccinations would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are at their peak.
The medical institute already sets maximum prices for vaccines to be paid by health insurers.
Experts are already clear on the vaccination process.
New Vaccination
Free vaccines for children in August
Since January, children born on August 2 and later can be vaccinated against pneumococcus free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of the vaccine.
Those who started the vaccination last year or earlier must pay for their own revaccination.
The first dose must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily had their children vaccinated against pneumococcus.
Parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
When vaccinating the youngest children, four doses are required.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccine doses.
But it will save on the treatment that children would need without vaccinations.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 per year for all vaccinations of children.
Vaccination was introduced by the so-called Yanot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections, including inflammation of the membranes of the brain and blood poisoning.
According to the survey in hospitals, up to 28 children under 10 years of age die from pneumococcal infections in our country per year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, about 40 countries have introduced paid vaccination of children against pneumococcus.
Will vaccinations be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination may be mandatory in the future.
Since January, it has been covered by insurance companies and is optional.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the civil association Vozlás, suggested that mandatory vaccinations would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at the international conference, which our association attended, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been enforced.
I think that's the path we have to take now, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcus.
At the moment, we are not thinking about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>en.
Voluntary Vaccination Has Its Disadvantages, Says Doctors
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Society of Pediatric Practitioners, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of boosters could be considered "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," however, says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect that more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcus by next year.
Vaccination against pneumococcus is also a breakthrough in that it is paid for by health insurance companies, not by the state, as the first vaccination of children.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thereby saving on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy their own drugs.
This, however, has to do with the concerns of pediatric practitioners regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in a similar way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MEPs feared that insurers could "draw money out of health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the drugs and wait for the insurance companies to pay them back.
According to estimates, individual pediatric practitioners will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It's not going to be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist ‘stealed in a museum’
Frank Frazetta's son has been charged with attempted robbery of $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
Named Mr. Frazetta and a second man used a excavator to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, aged 81, became famous for the creation of the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying Mr Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by long-running family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr Frazetta, Jr., aged 52, issued an oath stating that he had done so at his father's instruction "to get into the museum by any means possible and to move the paintings to the malting areas", according to the agency.
Mr Frazetta senior denied granting any such permission, as stated by the Agency.
Labour resists planned tax hikes
The ministers defended tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Torys “squandered” the opportunity to show that they were serious about postponing the deficit reduction decision until after the election.
Even the chancellor has come under fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Anger about Social Security
Trade unions protested that low-income workers were being punished for a recession they didn’t blame and warned ahead of time of “problems.”
Social security is on the rise – an increase of around <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion a year – which has outraged the community of entrepreneurs who said it was an employment tax while there should be a focus on economic recovery.
This increase, limited to these incomes of more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF PBR
Social security will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers' bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax for depreciation for small companies
Tax cuts for electric cars and wind farms
Increase in pension allocations by 2.5%
According to the estimate of the state financial administration, some income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and some income of <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while some income of <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will be increased by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers announced that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "complicated decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall on the top 5% of people with the highest incomes.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increases and spending cuts would be a “drop in the ocean” compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he believes the economy should grow at the turn of the year.
But making forecasts for future economic growth — which will affect the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced — must be taken into account after the chancellor was forced to revise past amounts.
In his opinion, the downturn in the economy this year was 4.75% - far worse than the 3.5% downturn predicted in April - because loans were <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A Wasted Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday warning of a "debt crisis" by Labour, called the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 trillion loan unbearable over the next six years.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how this could be paid for, they added, "cynically" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that was feasible," said Shadow Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit faster and on a larger scale.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to support spending next year rather than to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said about the timing of the announcement – for example, the above-mentioned inflation will rise and there will be an inability to pay benefits next April – that this could lead to the chancellor being charged in the election campaign if the money was hard to get back a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people are in dire need of it and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"Suspicious Budget"
Although ministers did not release details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that a cut in public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term cuts.
The acclaimed Institute of Budget Studies said the Chancellor’s figures indicated substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the future including transportation, higher education and defense.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director, Robert Chote.
“All important statements will come after the election if we win,” Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the Deloitte account supervisor, said in a statement.
"That was a report about a suspicious preliminary budget. Markets are implementing it."
The FBI is conducting an investigation into ‘American prisons in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating five Americans suspected of links to extremists in a Pakistani prison.
The men were arrested for attacking a house in Sargodha, eastern Punjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were reported missing in the last month at their home in Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also seeking information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were held there," Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been informed of the imprisonment and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed missing students," she said.
Pakistan's embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of the men's uncles.
He said the house had always been the center of attention of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, but said the United States must "cooperate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism that is rampant in the recruitment and training of individuals."
The disappearance of these five students from a home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Refusal of amnesty for Iranian torturers.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report details "ways of torture" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential election in June.
One of the men said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above-mentioned criticism of the report on respect for human rights.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been imprisoned and dozens killed in Iran since the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were put under arrest and prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent John Leyne, now in London, said that earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini declared certain forms of torture unauthorized and banned their execution in the Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
"False Confessions"
Amnesty International cited a report by 26-year-old computer science student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protesting the election results.
"I've been beaten in the face a lot," he said.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Five days later, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the elections and tortured to death in prison, while others were raped.
Senior Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in the Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and government reactions, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees should have been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a monument in Bristol into a ski run for the race.
The ski run for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the ski slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short ski jump in front of the 100 m long ski slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said that it was a beautiful view from the top of the ski run, but that it was truly depressing.
It was a beautiful sight of the city's blinking lights downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
The awards were given for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the ski slope.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and alarming reports about the alleged Islamization of Europe were spreading in general, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate — and whether they would integrate — into one of the continent’s most open secular societies.
After reading this book, some of the readers became admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French do not like headscarves" (2006), this elegant and debated study of the controversial issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the root.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now care for 5<0xC3><0xB7>6 million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that worry them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-based banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly secular issues that are being debated and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others well-known figures, including Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a debate about how one can be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are inclined to assume that this is the opposite of Selafi—the purist Sunni Islam supporters of Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but it influences European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
He asks himself how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so stubbornly defend the lay public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
He believes that Muslims are probably less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he found "tightening the bolts of values".
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may tend to say "Yes, but not now."
The most disappointing prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet’s environment.
The boundary ice is melting at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water resources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers as they wake up.
In the book "On Thin Ice", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, tells the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling, he describes a long tradition of polar explorers trying to capture a polar bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson with a brave fourteen-year-old lifeguard who fought only with a musket flask is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 75 polar bears in one circus tent.
Even today, zoo enclosures typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adult individuals in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they are hunted from helicopters and Indians on skis, and all are armed with powerful attack towels to blast off their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the waters north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, On Ice, Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and dismal accountability of science for the Arctic and an eye-catching glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have the answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.
For lack of exams.
Fridtjof Nansen's research trips in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated how floating ice was moving.
The submarines of the Cold War then mapped the sliding dividers as they submerged them.
Satellite exploration and vast fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but much is still being done thanks to fearless individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson takes a glimpse into the extremely fragile world of the slope system inside the Arctic ice, created by the drainage of salt water that shrinks as it freezes.
But from the height of that bear to the microscopic wonders inside, all of this is doomed to perish as summer ice moves, which will happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that could be us'
6,000 Marines lay wreaths on Arlington tombs
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
"In a few months, when we board, it could be us," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me in a way that honors me as I am trying to do.
He was one of the more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the Veterans Cemetery in several wards during a feast in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a feast in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition that Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this journey every year, stopping in different cities along the way to honor the memory of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profits in this, wreaths across America, which they lay in other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, the tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the memorable site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Ms. Hunt stated that this was her way of returning what she did to the victim.
It is a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in cloaks of warm cloth, the volunteers walked through the cemetery through the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older tombs from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War because these are not visited as often as newer tombs.
The mood was positive as the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine tree to the grayish tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red arch bellow the top.
In the vicinity of ward 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there was a real silence.
Associated service organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some sincerely wept, others prayed, and families and friends clung to each other in the cool air.
Some read names engraved in stones aloud, while others bowed down to see the little black and white namesakes pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped her tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the last resting place of artillery sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free . . . my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. contractor jailed by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has imprisoned a U.S. government contractor who was importing mobile phones and laptops into the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., a Bethesda-based company.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was detained on December 5.
Certain accusations have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical statements, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country in order to take over the prices, but permission has been denied.
The detention of the U.S. contractor may be the result of growing tensions between Castro’s communist brother, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was seen as a “deterrent tactic” in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the New York Times' imprisonment on Friday night.
The new policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used to send text messages, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one daily wage.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often wish to register must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detaining an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in Cuba’s prison are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Ms. Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
Imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which in any other open society would be legal - let's say free cell phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. human rights group's program, who recently published an unfavorable report on Cuba's freedoms, titled "New Castro, same Cuba," as a reference to the leader of the older brother, Fiura Rau, as a reference to the country's installation of Rau Rau.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said all solutions would be rather political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States just as the two countries are heading for a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials have uncovered a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of a conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters spying on the internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray rebel figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of the men posted a comment approving the terrorist attacks to the YouTube video site.
Saifillah took over the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get to a remote area of Pakistan in the Pakistani indigenous tribes zone, home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaida commanders and that the men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern district of Sarghod, far from the formidable mountains in the northwest, which became a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
The official said why they were dropped was a matter of anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain permission to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of the five - who remained in Pakistan and were questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role recruiters play in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has prioritized attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The organization’s recruiters act as guards, eliminating those who are not serious enough about their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
U.S. fake recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American targets and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years about allowing Kohu to approach them, as U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to infiltrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more web-based.
Tens of Thousands Protest in Copenhagen to Call for Climate Action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched in the streets this Saturday demanding more climate action from negotiators at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The protesters cited the number of many hundreds of thousands attending the event, but police exaggerate that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day a small incident occurred during UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists were walking through the city carrying banners with the English words "This is not Planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish proclaiming "Earth Says 'Enough'."
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had travelled to her mother’s birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the country’s bleak state, which is being affected by climate change, which is still happening.
That is part of the reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go around the world and appeal to the world's leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided all the time.
Police prevented protesters from approaching Bell's centre, saying they had detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating spectators, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and in black suits laid several charges near Copenhagen's main canal, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, starting with flares, but then there were "several large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
Asked if the demonstration had had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of."
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful, depending on the prospects of everyone.
The focus of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change are seen, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of other persons.
Test Data Reveals Persistent Racial Differences
Last week’s Federal Certificate of Achievement in Mathematics was a welcome element of good news regarding the District’s public education.
Although the district lags far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate showed greater progress in fourth and eighth graders over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest editions of the National Attestation Center for Teaching Advancement are the persistent differences in knowledge attained between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders in the District of Columbia has increased from 267 to 270 points over the past two years (out of a possible 500), but their African-American peers have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the gap in knowledge attainment increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant one point off from 245 to 245.
The average score for white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the district, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly came close to 58.
Some district education advocates have said in the past week that the results celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) have been more widely stimulated by white students where they have already had high scores.
This would suggest that we have increased the amount of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group advocating for equal education in the district.
I don’t jump up and down because of a two- or three-point variance, said D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticising Ms Rhee's administration style, Ms Brown said that reporting the test results means secondary education in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what is terrifying is that we spent almost no time and energy that needed to be devoted to our secondary education.
Ms Rhee said the district's effort is to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new reading curriculum, Wilson’s reading system, aimed at high school students and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their collegiate careers and are significantly lagging behind their peers.
The daily mathematics and math curriculum for the sixth grade, emphasizing the games and real-life experiences that came to the precinct under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think that we should continue to work and do the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the class level, said Mrs Rhee.
Others stated that the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and funds for low-performing schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
“It’s a certain distinct dilemma for Mrs. Michelle Rhee,” said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional remedial procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political repercussions that go against an important agenda.
But the reproach also belongs to other city directors who are trying to maintain a middle-diameter between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We must strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on their children to be provided with excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now head of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that a fundamental element of reducing the gap between achievements is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, in order to realize the eligibility of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who contracted his teachers' association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he sees as a "symbol" for looking for a bigger raise next year.
Making Higher Education Part of a Better Future
The tour bus entered the Gettysburg Dorm with a loud break.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
Until now, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on the campus.
Now she and other eighth-grade students in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their status was more than frightened visitors excited prospective students.
Yes! that's it! called Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully, as the low ratio of professors to students was revealed.
Pennsylvania College was one of seven that they visited on their three-day tour, and now they were completely intrigued by the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where.
However, this is a bearable problem regarding the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from universities or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this “long generation” of Spanish college students – remarkable results achieved – indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, have arrived in the United States without graduating from college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, as it underlines their point of progress for a generation that has played a marginal role in the country’s workforce.
Those who have attained higher education say that they had a natural inclination towards school and an innate drive to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and the millions of children who would like to graduate from college – especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we consider that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point will not solve this, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these children with a catch-up net in preschool age in all ways to get them into college.
The federal program that funded Graciela’s railroad trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run college preparatory programs that start for students from low-income groups in high schools and continue until those students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than 1% of whom have entered colleges, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's oil ministry reaches agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their infirm infrastructure during two auctions on Saturday.
Ten deals have been struck by Iraq’s oil ministry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in rebuilding Iraq’s oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have left with a capital stake in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one of them made a lost offer.
The two American companies reached agreements on the fields, which were auctioned in June.
The narrowing of the participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans on the way first, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news site.
That will be long before anything else is on sale in Iraq.
Security concerns highlighted by Tuesday’s massive coordinated bombings and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to discourage U.S. companies from doing much more business in Iraq, which has proven to have the third-largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
American firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have noticeably lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the Department.
Leading U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with Iraq’s oil ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts, which were awarded at the end of this week.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in bids for more contracts than all other companies and left with large stakes in contracts in two major fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological power, oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be comparable to its competitors and will honour its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the ministry at the price of a barrel, and the ministry is willing to pay for strengthening output above the current level in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A U.S. missile strike on the Pakistan-Afghan border this week appears to have killed al-Qaida's top operations planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car near the city of Miran Shah in Northern Waziristan province on Thursday, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have uncovered that the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA in the area of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were pointed at a white car heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency who was calling from Miran Shah.
The official said the local militants approached the point and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said Somalia was about to die.
Somalia has been cited as a senior al-Qaida military operations planner who led the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the establishment around the world, said a senior official who does not wish to be appointed, who cited the sensitive nature of the US air strikes on Pakistani territory.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the top leadership of al-Qaeda and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was rapidly advancing in the al-Qaida hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way in order to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the Indigenous tribes zone, and three other top post-operative leaders.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has declined since summer from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to the Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit group.
The cuts may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing people they suspected were informants.
The top U.N. delegate to Kabul has resigned.
The top U.N. delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would like to step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that has been marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed presidential election in Afghanistan.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration decides to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for reducing the situation, which starts in 18 months, should be a call for other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel helping in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he had made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has started searching for a replacement.
Officials said the decision was between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian descent and had previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenne, a Frenchman who had previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country’s presidential election by masking the presence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations, but said the accusations against Galgraith -- who was released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the top citizen representative to coordinate relief efforts at the U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, saying he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of his efforts in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermine her ability to use her capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have only had the opportunity to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "other significant sanctions" on Iran over its lack of engagement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of areas at war in Afghanistan and Iraq, underestimated the prospect of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about probable developments.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of those sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said a “package of incentives and deterrence” would require “to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons” because “its people will suffer exceptionally” sanctions.
According to a statement issued on Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will suffer serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN nuclear safety committee and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for the urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be pulling out of the interim agreements – partly because, the expert says, the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly speaking, as far as Iran’s stubbornness towards the international community is concerned, in the case of some proposals that it actually agreed to in early October, I think it has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to seeking other elections, including monitoring, what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “degrading sanctions.”
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called “unfounded and unfounded accusations” before some members of the Security Committee about Iran’s nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers to “achieve a reasonable long-term solution.”
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich region of Kurdistan to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions remain between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly due to borders, property rights and income distribution.
Ghets urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delaying US plans to limit the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading “Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children” and “One more child means one more grave.”
Then they learned that when official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We didn’t save anything for others, says Wang, 31, a HR manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China’s more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child was introduced, creating two generations of only notorious chubby and pampered children, affectionately nicknamed “little emperors,” a country threatened by a population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six before the policy went into effect, according to UN data.
The distribution of the population, where the population aged 60 years and above is predicted to skyrocket from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with populations with higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to “help reduce the proportions of the aging population and reduce the number of the workforce in the future.”
He says it's about "being old, it's not about being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual soothing
As enshrined in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced under the Communist Party.
Couples who violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s official sites promoted policies that helped the country prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned in advancing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to have abortions on their second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually moderated in their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions -- including city dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were single children -- and in 2007 they eased the diction of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Population Research, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of the regulation detailing how to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
Annoying response
While officials in a rural city around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples wishing to have a second child after the campaign began, most city districts have not reported changes.
Huinan City District, with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city is still expected to be only around 165,000 in 2010 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people didn’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who only have insufficient health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a vital interceptor network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is in a relationship with her first child in the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
It's about the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a HR manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: “We were the center of attention of our families and everyone took care of us.
We weren’t used to providing care, and in fact we didn’t want to worry about others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who runs a translation company, expressed this much more openly.
For two-career middle-class parents who have reduced birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds see their parents as the breakthrough of the early days of the Chia experiment with capitalism, and they don’t want this way of feeding themselves, he says.
One child puts enormous demands on the time of parents, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the questions of the space -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have your resume ready by the time the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher nutrient standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unruly stances and mutual slander -- re-focused Friday on releasing a document proposing ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the near future.
The text, which can provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But important progress was seen in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc task force, this text discreetly sets out how much money rich countries should provide to those poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a full palette of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon emissions, and what the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers will still be able to tolerate should be.
This adds a lot of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, chief executive of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutjajar, who proposed the six-page document, a 180-page briefing from the meeting to focus on what UN climate chief Yvo de Boer described as a "big picture".
It outlines the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent within a year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent during that period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union urgently discussed on Friday a pledge to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
But Friday still featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated last week’s talks.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern rejected a speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrialized countries compared to volunteering for major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had set a tougher line against China by Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not agree to the treaty without transferring major developing countries and carrying out actions, Stern said, also complaining that the text was insufficient to secure restrictions and should be reviewed by external observers.
Stern made the comment an hour after Chinese deputy foreign secretary He Yafei told a U.S. chief negotiator on climate issues that either a lack of “peasant reason” or “extraordinary irresponsibility” led earlier in the week to the message that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global issues.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, tensions have broken out both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States for fulfilling their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world’s most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative to take more forceful action.
Ricardo Ulate, Costa Rica’s delegate, said it’s not surprising that major powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of cutting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers from acting responsibly in their actions.
It’s clearly a game of having a new economic hegemony unfold, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated they would like to continue pushing for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said a political agreement would be the best outcome of the talks.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate talks on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations "has caused a political turmoil for the entire political process" in part because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations sparked a new urgency once the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of government competed for an agreement.
High-ranking officials such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s Deputy Minister got off the planes and ran through Bella Center halls to the closed doors of meetings and new conferences so they could set out the claims to be assessed next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering – with 13,000 people moving daily from and to the convention center, guitar-playing activists staged at night ironic spectacles about the countries they thought had sent them out, hand-to-hand submissions on paper rather than e-mail – driven by a challenge.
The intensity is just a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen, and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state.
“We’ve gotten into high categories,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister of Global Policy for International Nature Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain's first train at 140 miles per hour redefined feelings this Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle slashed through the darkness to signal the departure of a train that had revolutionized Britain's transport.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent, to St Pancras, London, and cover a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train outside London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland with London.
Neglected stagnant waters should shorten transport times in passenger transport and on commercial roads, and switching from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
Theoretically, the three main political parties were allowed to win for this vision.
But the dozens of trillions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects, and environmental concerns now hampered the construction of Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasible study, handed over its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
She provided him with a detailed map of the routes for the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route of London's connection to the West Midlands was designed to be within five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods where the impact on the environment could be problematic.
In the open countryside, up to 25 m of the final route was planned.
HS2 also envisages identifying three options for an extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped conformation, where one high-speed line should lead to West Midland.
The track should be shared near Birmingham with one branch running from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
There should be a route to Scotland.
"It looks like the most powerful choice has been made," said the railway expert.
Once this is done, the journey times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open until 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 2,250 miles per hour, making the UK's network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already being designed to accommodate 400 m long trains capable of carrying 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Given the capital constraints, it is expected that the existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts say that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the network should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be put into operation not on high-speed lines, but on already existing lines north of Birmingham, and keep running times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the revolution on the railways.
Taxpayers paid a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 mortgage on the Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory front seat in the House of Deputies, paid thousands of pounds last year for the orangery he built in his house in the electoral district.
A party spokesperson for the prison, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "from rations," raised his mortgage to <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-lined extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds a month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in a timely manner and so Sir Thomasen Legg, who was inspecting the membership expenditures, was not questioned. Last night Mr Duncan voiced his demands "it could have been cleaner or easier".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two-storey village houses in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
There's a kitchen, a living room, and a dining room on the ground floor, but the IRS agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is marked as "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as a "greenhouse for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan converted the pupillary security into a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage from his London estate to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the House of Representatives.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 a month.
The interest of RBS in the repayment of Mr Duncan’s mortgage could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all this was intended to finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard RBS mortgage repayment variable fell in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March this year, while remaining.
The latest document from the municipal authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1250 per month in May this year.
Mr. Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed him and said MPs had to survive “on a ration” after the spending scandal.
"It's basically nationalized, you have to live on the ration, and you're treated like shit."
He said: "I spent money on my garden and the claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his releases in May when it turned out he was claiming thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the tax office approved that it “could be considered excessive.”
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr. Duncan’s lawn in protest after it was revealed he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked last night about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said: "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the tax office and subsequently by Legge."
He added: “This is not a contentious issue of hiding and twisting or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's an absolutely straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's all.
This could not be in many other ways cleaner or simpler.”
Come and take a close look at the cottage on the Brighton coast with the Advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new meaning to life in the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages shop-like creativity, has urged 24 owners to decorate their huts for each day in December, and to use Christmas collets as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when visitors were allowed to view the last chat from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and with a bishop's loaf and mulled wine, provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, and The First No<0xC3><0xAB>l, where the hut represented the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-scholarly priest in the Diocese of Chicago and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we, as a church, expect people to come to other people's old buildings? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar in the huts arose just as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way.”
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which is expected to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, a demonstration around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday, which could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said the growing global mobilization, as evidenced by the current demonstrations, had contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of a possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to AFP, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, began breaking windows with paving stones and hammers.
The police immediately intervened vigorously.
In total, police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups that had already manifested themselves in April at a NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "indiscriminately" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and sitting "held in the streets as early as Saturday evening" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A podium was erected for the speakers, before which a spiritual candlelight meeting was held with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue cloaks, held their first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the urging of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today, we are going to the streets to demand the settlement of ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: it's time, said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying up, we can walk in them today, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement for another world has come closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world ".
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, marched in red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
Several hundred protesters took to the streets in Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Canada to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elects its own president, Georgia denounces it as 'fake'
Abkhazia elects its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, while Tbilisi says the move is a “farce.”
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz election commission, participation was 58% just hours before the closing of the polling stations.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which has condemned the elections.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen to Russian domination," his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of the territory, with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After secession from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, Kvar<0xC4><0x8D>ija Svetlanova, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagap<0xC5><0xA1>, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to vote at the school in the capital, Sukhumi, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Across this small country of 216,000 people, huge billboards with Bagapsh are placed alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who had come to oversee the successful course of the elections were warmly welcomed by District Mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We Abkhazians are grateful," he said, referring to Moscow's support for Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, and toasted it with a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former vice president Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized contracts signed last year with Moscow, such as a deal that allows Russia control of Abkhazia’s rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive duel must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which is expected to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, a demonstration around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A podium was erected for the speakers, before which a spiritual candlelight meeting was held with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP reporter, the incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began breaking windows.
Police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several demonstrators to the ground.
In total, police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were in particular members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
In the late afternoon, one police officer was injured with a paving stone on his jaw, and four cars were set on fire near a squat near the incidents, resulting in the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters blew up again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, including London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue cloaks, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create a "blue wave" for a "fair climate".
Today, we are going to the streets to demand the settlement of ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, one of the figures of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world ".
Oxfam has summoned several celebrities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
In Manila, hundreds of people demonstrated in front of the city hall, mostly students dressed in red and wearing scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters also met demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general gymnasium, said Chatel.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said Sunday during an interview with JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" as part of the reform of general gymnasiums, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the final year of the gymnasium with a focus on exact sciences.
All second-year students will now have four hours a week, and the same general culture program will be available to all, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "hypocrisy must be stopped" because, according to him, the S specialization is no longer focused on exact sciences, but "in essence, it is the best students".
The ES and L specializations cannot be for S some sub-specializations, he continues, stressing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals complaining that in the last year of professional grammar schools they do not teach geography and history".
A survey by Ifop, which was published by the daily Humanité on Saturday, showed that seven out of ten Frenchmen (69%) disagreed with the government’s project to abolish compulsory history and geography in the S-grade high school graduation class, which is why many intellectuals and teachers criticized the abolition.
The Minister, on the other hand, added that "it is not an option" to cancel the philosophy in the specialization program S graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform of teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday’s mobilization against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical education of future gymnasium professors.
As part of the Master's Degree 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will undergo an entrance exam focused on their field and at the end of the year another exam verifying their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of the Master’s degree and will perform as an intern professor in front of students in the first year.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission procedure, you will gain more experience with the students, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which so far does not exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite École Normale Supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the call announced this morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (GIEC), at the initiative of the University of Ecole Normale Supérieure on Ulm Street.
According to one AFP journalist, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a kind of one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions from experts who will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to learn more, explained 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after the fish from the local pond, which the students named so.
About twenty contributing experts from different scientific disciplines will be selected, specifying that the selection is based on their charisma.
"We can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic targets in minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking to fifty listeners without any preconceived remarks, using only graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will recognize that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
Videos shot at these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February, and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry guards in prisons, planned measures
Prison guards unions announced a "general mobilization" on Friday, demanding bonuses and overtime payments by Christmas, which were postponed to January for financial reasons.
Prison FO (2nd Guards Union) asked employees who would not be on duty to attend a demonstration held on Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities to “block” them, warning of “theft of their wages”.
The CGT for Prison Guards (3rd Division of this Sector) called on them to "convene assemblies in individual prisons and begin a fundamental mobilization" with the view that it is "disgraceful and unacceptable" that "overtimes and surcharges for night, Sunday and holiday work" done in October should not be paid.
The first union of wardens, the Federal Union of Prison Wardens (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) to express dissatisfaction and indignation".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased significantly in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison wardens’ unions assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts that prison personnel are making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system.
I have ordered the prison administration to take immediate action to ensure that the situation created by a poor assessment of the number of overtimes will never happen again in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
Thus, the December wage will be low, with the exception of executives who receive famous bonuses for performing the function and meeting the goals, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those "there is always a place in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the inter-regional FO union in Marseille was outraged and announced its decision to boycott until the recall of "all meetings and subpoenas".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or public holidays unless they are paid the allowances for these days of October in December, as well as for overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
“At a time when we are given more work and more assignments without being provided with additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking staff to pay for it,” the CGT prison guards in Bordeaux said.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds are scarce, noted Ufap Secretary General, Jean-François Forget.
Obama Says He Gives Better Gifts For Christmas Than He Gets
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to the “goddess” screen Oprah Winfrey that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: “I give better gifts than the ones I receive.”
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special issue of the show, which will air on Sunday evening on ABC, about how they are going to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, gets his share.
Jesus also likes Boa, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will also “obviously” receive a gift, according to excerpts from a preview of the show.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband’s claims about the quality of gifts, which she receives: “Not that way, I gave you great gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Well, that's true, of course, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards, with humor, he pointed his finger at the First Lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
In this one-hour, very relaxed show with a famous presenter who has been a staunch supporter of Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obama spouses also spoke to Obama about their most favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a wheel with a ten-speed gearbox, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father had given him for Christmas, which he rarely encountered.
I remember seeing my father come to see us for Christmas and he gave me the basketball, the president told me.
It wasn’t until long afterwards that I realized that he had actually given me the ball.
The first lady remembered the dollhouse again.
I didn’t know how to organize everything in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday Surged Again, RTL Says He's In Artificial Sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to "injuries" caused by a larger operation he underwent in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while RTL said the singer is in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors noted “injuries resulting from surgery” on a defecated disc he suffered in Paris on November 26, his press department said in Paris, saying the lesions required “legal surgery.”
However, the singer's press department tried to reassure the public, saying the situation was "under control" and announcing that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours.
According to RTL, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to prevent "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will be a little more sure, RTL adds.
At the request of AFP, the press department did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also said that "some sources" said no drainage had been installed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a defective disc.
The surgery, which was planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in the art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the information provided by RTL.
After the operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection that occurred after the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, told RTL radio on Thursday that his boyfriend was going through a "bad time" but added that he was "not worried" about the rocker because he was a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing something stupid, because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, singer-producer Jean-Claude Camus calmed the situation, saying Johnny Hallyday was “responsive to antibiotics” and that the infection had been “stopped”.
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laetitia, the singer’s wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a "small tumor of the small intestine" and then for a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, each of his health problems is very much monitored and commented. Fans and journalists noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to deny the news of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet's premiere in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a large pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championships in a small pool in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, at which overalls were last allowed, only three world records were broken, although much more were expected.
One of them was surpassed by the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200 m positional race and the other two men's relays of Russia in the 4x50 m positional race.
A big grief for Bousquet, who made his mark on the world record in the 50 m freestyle, which he already holds in a large swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50-meter freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which ten swimmers premiered instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croats Duje Draganje (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30), as he had predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The overalls have helped set 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which hosted them for the first time in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the overalls this time did not help the German Paul Biedermann, a two-time world champion in a large pool in Rome in the summer, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the 400-meter freestyle record (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't put everything into that race.
I knew I wouldn’t break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zola's Romance Sarcophagus Plate Auctioned for $1.5 Million
A Romanesque sarcophagus that belonged to no one but French writer Emile Zola was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, much more than estimated, art dealer Sotheby's said.
The price of this two-meter-long and 63-cm-high front plate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satires and bacchants, is a rare work, there are very few such pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, Vice President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still underway, but it is probably the most bid for, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola acquired this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The album was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated her bathtub with it in her private hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly the President of the Council before Marshal Petain took office.
There she remained in the shade for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered during a search of the Louvre museum database that the plaque was part of the "remains of Emile Zola" opened from 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
President Zelaya's resignation from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure, were not met.
“After the phone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything so far suggests that there is no way to make this transfer happen,” Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
A Mexican government plane that flew to El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya flew back, a source at the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The coup d’etat government wanted to force President Zelaya to “resign” and to apply for political asylum abroad, only to give him the opportunity to leave safely.
But the ousted president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exiled head of state.
The coup d’etat government “failed yet another time when it wanted me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, often referring to the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the ousted president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, playing a couple of chords.
The Mexican embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told the Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
"I will not seek asylum from any country," Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
“If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people,” he said.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military has stepped up security.
Brazil’s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the government’s stance.
This shows their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who became close to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of there, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of “treason” he is accused of, the Putschist government says.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election to replace President Zelaya on November 29.
In the controversial elections recognized by the United States, but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance spurs optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended in growth on Thursday, and the results of the US trade balance show an increase in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with technology dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegzo of FTN Financial commented.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on a "half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focused primarily on the U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
Analysts were expecting an increase in the deficit.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week unemployment rose against expectations and the number of jobseekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen “to the lowest this year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market also declined.
Treasury revenue over 10 years rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening and revenue over 30 years rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters chant "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime on Thursday whistled at the wives of political prisoners who had gathered in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners were whistled directly on the street by supporters of the Castro regime as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, the journalist said.
Away with the Yankees!, “The mercenaries!”, “The streets belong to the revolutionaries!”, “Long live Fidel and Raul!” the regime’s supporters chanted with a raised fist to the dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came to "ensure security".
The day before, there was a similar demonstration in Havana against "Ladies in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana's Vedado district, about ten civilian police officers were detained as they were also about to manifest on Thursday to mark World Human Rights Day, a journalist told AFP.
According to the journalist, police loaded dissidents who were whistled by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
Arrests of dissidents under similar conditions last only a few hours.
The winners of the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, "Ladies in White", organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” paid by their mortal enemy, the United States.
A finished miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of supporters of the regime against "revolutionary opponents".
Cuba, led by the Communist Party and one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disregarding human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during rush hour Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28, allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in or in front of the pharmacy, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
An elderly gentleman, born in 1929, died in a hospital, according to the Alliance Police Syndicate.
In or before this pharmacy, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, about 30 years old, began to defend himself and was wounded.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where the 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second wounded is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transported to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, then fled into the street, still on Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
He wounded two others, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, as it all took place in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, head of the Alliance Syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, reportedly tried to stop the madman and disarm him.
I saw a 30-year-old man in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A mob rushed him, including a city policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to apprehend an armed man and were wounded with their fists, a police source said.
The incident took place in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passersby came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a big wound on his stomach, Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about 30-year-old, who had also been stabbed with a knife, arrived.
The man, who did not have his identity documents, was later arrested by the state police.
The prosecutor in Nanterre referred the case to the Regional Police Investigation Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, waiting to be questioned.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said six police officers were needed to take him to the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "completely out of his mind" like "all the madmen of this kind whose power increases tenfold in action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer calls for an end to prosecution
Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski’s lawyer again asked on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) for an end to the prosecution of his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a moral scandal that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, a legal counsel for the director of "The Pianist," criticized three judges in California's Second District Court of Appeals for serious misconduct during a court hearing at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now, said lawyer Hummel, adding that Laurence Rittenband, the judge who ruled the case at the time, "had a chill in his back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) was supposed to negotiate with the prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail – a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the state prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refuses to suspend the criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will request a court hearing in which he will be able to present evidence of his claims.
The prosecutor reiterated what had already been said in the first state, namely that there would be no serious study of the application for a stay of prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before a court ruled in a case of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy Attorney General Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
In this case, do we want to send a message not only to Roman Polaski, but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?
He believes that the director "requests favor from the court and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel was not the only one who demanded the suspension of the criminal prosecution of Roman Polanski.
Victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, also called for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the perpetual harassment every time the Polanski case emerged, adding: “Nobody in this room can say that the trial was fair.”
Thirty-two years, that’s enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26.
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest in his Gstaad cottage, where he awaits possible expulsion.
Wall Street ends without a direction, it is slowed by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, the market is swinging between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased significantly, and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that "helped improve market sentiment in terms of stability of the economic recovery," summed up analyst Charles Schwab.
In the U.S., retail sales grew by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary index estimate from the University of Michigan, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising sharply to 73.4 in December from 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices were hampered by a new rise in the dollar's price against the euro, which is at its highest in two months, "pushing downward sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology stocks are losing ground.
The stock market has fallen.
Treasury revenue over 10 years rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday evening, and over 30 years it rose to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month-long journey across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream of being voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great beauty celebration was held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year, and so far five candidates have won the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargboo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Mao from Canada were selected as either Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
“I’ve seen so many things and I’ve had so many experiences!” confided Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which is being held in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not have dreamed of a more beautiful country in which I would put my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, confided Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa bore the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "breathtaking country".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, Miss is now focused on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who is also running for Aishwarya Rai, the winner of 1994, who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former beauty queen of South Africa Michelle McLean and the chairman of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome a world with a warmth that is hard to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Unusual for the president, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will be the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm.
According to David’s son, reports of Hallyday’s condition are “very positive.”
The news of Johnny Hallyday’s condition is “very positive,” as his son David assured us on Friday’s arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The reports are very positive.
“It’s very strong and it’s going very well,” said David Hallyday as he got off the plane from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time.
The singer's son, who appeared calm, said he would "as soon as possible" arrive at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-operative infection following an operation on a debilitated intervertebral disc he underwent on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press release, the singer was given a night in Los Angeles for comfort "induced to artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday has already been put to artificial sleep by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, France. He was hospitalized due to an infection after an operation of a degenerated intervertebral disc on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance at a French lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
Yves Catone, head of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, said he was leaving for Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I spoke personally with the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this trip is not a problem, which surprised me greatly, since I have already suffered from intervertebral disc protrusion twice, he added.
He told RTL radio that the singer had apparently left Paris after the operation without a drone, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he worked at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma from a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted of cases of neglect of medical care, tax evasion and fraud.
Medical Attorney Olivier Metzner called him a "scrupulous man" who is "regularly" summoned to the medical chamber and cannot be "recommended from afar".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the procedure was "completely well" and the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, so the introduction of a drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer's health problems have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains with a question mark.
It is clear that the date for the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and urges the Nouveau Centre party not to continue to use their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançais Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, to appropriate the abbreviation of the former Giscard party, saying it must not use the abbreviation in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to adopt the abbreviation UDF, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to carry her legacy after he reached out to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Movement Nouveau Centre (NC).
His move gained the support of Hervé de Charett (formerly for-UMP now for NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF brand as the first to have it registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, a committee of the UDF Association led by friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to be expropriated, stepped out of its silence and filed a formal request to the minister and MPs to stop using the abbreviation and hand back ownership of the trademark, under threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised alarming statements about proposing to your political movement to +retake+ the abbreviation UDF, the Association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem party or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance center.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF today+, the signatories of the letter also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, the UDF Committee explains, asking the NC movement to “immediately remove all references to the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (its) websites.”
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners".
If you do not, we will go to the courts to ensure that the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members are respected.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "choose" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002, to establish the UMP.
According to them, the Nouveau centre has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 voted to join the MoD for three years and to create a committee tasked with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the mark", he was "not a member of the UDF for three years, but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used a non-existent acronym registration to do so at his own expense.
This intactness begins to turn into a crime, they claim, and then ironically comment on NC’s strategy: “It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to make a name for oneself than to step out of anonymity by fraudulently adopting a name to which we have no right.”
Liliane Bettencourt’s case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of a state of weakness.
A court in Nanterre on Friday decided to try artist François-Marie Banier and rule on whether he exploited the weakness of the 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of some of her fortune, which his daughter Liliane Bettencourt accuses him of.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of celebrities, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of a state of weakness, which is a criminal offense for which a maximum penalty of 3 years and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000 are imposed.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter attack each other and fight for the management of the cosmetic empire of L’Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt to be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L’Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010, while commenting on whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and in what period.
I think he's going to go through it.
I'll talk to her about it," Ms Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for François Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
Expertise will show that he manipulated this old lady (M. Banier) who needs protection.
It’s been two years since Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter opened criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artisan who she accuses of using her mother’s weakness for years to collect a billion euros in cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always denied being manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-time friend.
While the court had to assess the merits of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' lawsuit, Friday's lawyers' court speech turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer submitted three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she expressed her distrust of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, "Could you explain to my daughter that I have been writing to Banier for fifteen years once or twice a day.
Ever since she got married, I’ve never been able to talk to Françoise.”
The prosecutor’s office in Nanterre again found the complainant’s conduct unjustified, all the more so since the custody judge rejected her request to initiate proceedings to grant legal protection to her mother in those days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of attending the court, not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for her," said prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided to rule on Ms Bettencourt-Meyers's legitimacy at the time of the trial.
The Managerial Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been useless.
For more than a decade, the behavior of the management of large companies towards employees has been reminiscent of the attitude of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about making employees identify with the “values” determined from the mountain, as it used to be, when it was necessary to impose on the consumer products that came from the ideas of the heads of factory technicians.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution has aligned the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction...although authoritarian efforts to impose products other than customer preferences are regularly coming back!
The passive attitude of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that affects mostly managerial staff.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI “requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to anticipate” and requires from employees commitments that are completely at odds with the revenues of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that aims to put employees at the center of the company’s interest as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Will internal opinion polls – such as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees – contribute to a revolution in management practices?
I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of the new situation, the structure will return, after various turns, to what it has always done!
Furthermore, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of engineering colleges, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of convenience, they are adopting an old behaviorist theory, now revived by “neurologists” from the US and widely disseminated without much knowledge of scientific institutes and the media.
The fact that it is possible to move the "levers" (sic) of the involvement of managers, showed a recent survey by the agency Ipsos on the site Figaro.fr, which only confirms the managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating a basic insight into all the intentions and practices of management: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is dealt with only by studies of Motivational Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined dox, which will allow them, through the image that speaks about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and put their HR management "on the right track".
This creates a breeding ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
With his speech in Oslo: “A Just War,” Obama won praise from the right.
The U.S. right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had defended the concept of a "just war" against enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who initially mocked Obama’s Oct. 9 award, applauded the presidential speech this time, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, to USA Today, adding that she herself expressed herself on the topic of the "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs, which are just coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists should be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used the speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives congratulated, acknowledging above all the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech to be completely historical, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is considered by some to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was excited to see a "left-wing president" reminding Nobel committee members that they themselves would not be free and could not hand over the Peace Prize if the use of force did not exist.
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a “very American speech.”
Not only did he present himself as a “world citizen” as always, but he “speaked like an American president” and reminded Europeans “that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves and that they are not doing too much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few right-wing dissatisfied are Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as “uniform, pompous and uninspired,” according to the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
“When we wrap war in the envelope of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he said.
However, the middle-left press takes a commendable stance on the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to view the awarding of the peace prize to Obama as premature, it has rated his performance as "overpowering", even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decision-making in conflict resolution, the fight against poverty and oppression.”
Obama “made the speech that was needed,” the New York Times said, calling the speech “simple and instructive.”
Road hauliers: three marathons to a deal that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons, the unions of road hauliers and the TLF, the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for a strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau said he was "rejoicing" at the signing of the agreement on Friday, following several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions on Friday, the negotiators broke up early in the morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Despite the fact that three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the meeting.
But it took another more than six hours of the meeting, which began at 11:00, for everyone to agree and at 6 p.m. to sign the agreement.
The conflict “would hurt businesses greatly” and “would run the risk of disrupting holidays at the end of the year,” Bussereau said.
The text includes wage increases of 4% for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we will order our members to avoid blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are unhappy,” he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was difficult to admit a hike in high salaries due to international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a deal of common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic deal".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a revaluation of travel expenses of 3% and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow focusing on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million reduction in corporate wage taxes" that was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on by the National Assembly on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate for a "concurrent" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the entire field, in case of extension by the Ministry of Labor.
It will take place "as soon as possible," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be delayed by the disagreement of employers' organizations.
The FNTR is talking about "bad trade" as <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million "has already been offered to the sector as part of a carbon tax compensation".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to take emergency action, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger turkey eaters during the upcoming Christmas holidays, complained Unostra.
For Otre, the deal threatens to "bury a large number of small and medium-sized businesses" over the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: traffic interruptions over the weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP's proposals.
The interruption of traffic on the RER A commuter train line, the largest public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the unions and the RATP management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the issue of the premium request.
On Saturday and Sunday, days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, the trains will run only between 10 am and 8 pm, on the main section (between La Défense and Nation) will run every second train, outside this section only one train out of four.
Connection to SNCF will be interrupted at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP has tried to secure connections to large department stores".
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by the RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one out of two trains was at the top of the line, and virtually no trains were in the off-peak hours as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, among other things because pupils and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to make sure he arrives on time".
The Saint-Lazare railway station was not overcrowded, the SNCF state railway announced, as more law enforcement officers and law enforcement officers were predicted.
Suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a metro connection.
The next general meeting of the strikers will take place on Saturday and Sunday to assess the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the leadership, which the unions rated as "weak".
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains in all respects, working hours adjustment, career progression, etc.
But this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (CommitteesSouth).
RATP has even postponed proposals for the premium for the time being, making it worse for the CGT, saying the management "had not been able to solve the problem, while the travel agents and the SNCF were able to do so".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for the exercise of the profession will be reviewed more closely," RATP said.
Which is why trade unionists think the company "is making fun of weekend travelers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the company's committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to meet in the interest of "calm down".
There is a risk that the conflict will spread to RER B on Tuesday after Unsa and the Independents announce a strike alert.
The unions are demanding a premium of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>120 (Unsa) and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150, including <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Independents) and complaining about worsening working conditions on the route, which carries a million passengers a day.
RER drivers earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,200 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,700 in gross wages and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>650 in non-regular hours and Sunday and public holidays.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved for the Kurdish side, and this decision carries dire consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled on the abolition of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately sparked protests and demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to lend a friendly hand to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been disbanded as it has become a “nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimously passed by 11 judges, where a majority of seven votes was needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and lawmaker Aysely Tugluková, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tuglukova and the confiscation of the party’s assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party’s leadership warned before the verdict that MEPs would rather leave Parliament than serve as MEPs without political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of a trial launched in 2007 by Cassation Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, accusing the DTP of obeying the “orders” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries regard as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
The party says it has no "fundamental connection" with the PKK, but refuses to identify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes as the government extends a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offers a series of measures to strengthen their rights, and tries to curb Kurdish support for the PKK to end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations have erupted in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is mostly inhabited by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or shot rocks with slingshots.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said the justice decision would only "promote desperation".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning the party, he said in a press release.
The government, made up of the party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are against the principle of cancellation of parties.
This is not the case, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete blowout of the democratic proposals initiated by the government, commented the political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for the reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
A nice crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter technical services department of FES.
But so that its employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, they will drive out to 20 so-called sections of the A-splitter, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and passageways such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and downhill sections such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle over a maximum of three hours with damp salt, which holds better, about 1040 kilometers.
Therefore, FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the roads are free when the transport to work begins."
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for the spreaders."
It is only when it does not snow that the access and interconnection roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße, take place.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll be complaining there.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES pedestrians set out on the road, preferably cleaning dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually cannot take care of all cycling trails.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that monitors the bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As the ice sheets form quickly, the spreaders leave as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-high animal ran over two powerful hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with sickle-tailed claws, and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues write in the Thursday issue of the journal Science that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily traits.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then located in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window on the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about kinship, distribution and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
“Sometimes we find a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Triassic sediments,” said team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The finding confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are very rare, usually only fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is generally questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards were divided into three most important developmental lines: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, as well as birds, "long-necked" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivorous animals such as Ornithistors and Trinithistors.
Tawa hallae is the original terapod after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, researchers found evidence of air bags, which even the descendants of theropods have birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related lineage of giant sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, he created this useful innovation probably already a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migrant waves to North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists concluded that lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, the three lines of development soon split and spread from South America to all the continents that then, as the supercontinent Pangaea, formed a single Earth mass.
The team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related, theropods.
The three cannot come from one common, migratory ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could bring together a distorted picture, as many primitive dinosaur fossils have survived in South America, and they are rarely found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs have shown that they evolved from a relatively rare secondary lineage of the reptile genus to the ruling vertebrates on earth during the Earth's Middle Ages, it remains a mystery.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards, and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species evolved, while relatives became extinct and the interface between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction, which the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but not the reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could squeeze out the competition.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, the impact helped another group of animals that also evolved in the Triassic and have lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clearing of the occupied Goethe University casino in Frankfurt has caused a worldwide uproar.
278 professors and lecturers at Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the presidium-instigated police action.
Because the walls and artworks were scratched, university president Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers on strike evacuated last week.
Five students were injured.
Damage to the cause, according to the signatories, does not justify the "forced dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police command".
Evacuation is an “unacceptable interference” with the freedoms of research and science.
Exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "unauthorized and criminalize protest" and distracts attention from the content.
The Presidency has avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturers call for an end to the criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support material damage.
Justified protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi’s mysterious Earth Youth, Alexander Klein.
Hessian Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is defending the university president's move and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupancy are totally unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in the Current Stunde (Actual Hour) in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have sympathy for the protest, but we have no sympathy for vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it differently.
The CDU is taking painted walls as a pretext to criminalise the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of addressing the students’ arguments and demands, there was a clean-up.
Linke filed a motion calling on the interior minister to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, it was a strictly guarded location where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district of 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Major micro and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established contacts with the Riedberg Science Centre in Frankfurt - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several visits took place and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Ridberg signed a "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow’s Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Zelenograd’s Prefect Anatoly Smirnov, and by Chief Planning Officer Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchanges
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be allowed to settle in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, major Sitronics and Rossiskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which the research facilities are located.
The Stuttgart Brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be prepared at all.
For supporters of the project, it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
Well, the S21 is more than a station launch, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a decade of desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks, which ended in the city center, were then considered to be transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as the brakes of modern rail transport, because it took a huge amount of time to clutch the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Drive, stop for a while, move on - that's how it should work.
That is why the main stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is why the slogan is "the heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Very ambitious planners themselves realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities the start of construction is almost unfinancial.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, the main stations no longer have problems getting in and out.
Still: Starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
This was done by local and local politicians.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state concern.
Urbanistically, the project can still be excused in some way.
There will be a new urban space that - if we believe the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
The S21 is harmful to the rail system.
The transit station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
A modern transport policy must, however, first and foremost be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight car transport on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to steep ascents.
More importantly, the S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
A good <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion was to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts estimate that 10 to 15 billion are real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other nodal points and bottlenecks in the network.
There are sixty major projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of a 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this route has been built at a slow pace.
It would have to be pushed hard here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Rhine Valley will become the bottleneck of international freight: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the ruling on the airport.
The state government has left open in the Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court of Justice (VGH) on the ban on night flights and let it be revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally review the more than 400-page ruling by the VGH, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today explained in writing that the state would have to amend the night flight ban if the planned northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport were to be built.
Permitting 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the provincial government, does not correspond to the statutory protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to seek a review of the ruling.
The opposition criticised the delay and urged the government to abandon the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to the promises they made before the election to ban night flights, otherwise it could be considered a "violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word," Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said in a reference to the FDP's election slogan, "We keep our word."
Minister Posch dismissed Schäfer-Gümbel's reprimand, saying the country's government was trying to get to its night flights through "twisting the law and tricks".
Precise legal control takes its time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "rapid first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction’s statements about the ban on night flights have never been the same as those made by the opposition.
U.S. Banks Are Paying Aid
America's crisis-shocked big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America repaid $45 billion in bailouts from the Tarp bank rescue fund on Wednesday.
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup also plans to repay the state aid.
Thus, the institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have occurred by accepting money - limiting bonus payments to managers and paying high fees.
Bank of America has secured $19 billion in net money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest from her cash register, which was filled, among other things, thanks to union sales.
The bank’s chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday evening: “The money injections have helped us through a difficult time.
The Monetary Institute took over Merrill Lynch Investment Bank at the height of the financial crisis.
Citigroup wants to free itself from its obligations to the state also by obtaining money in the capital market.
According to CNBC, the bank could have announced a capital increase of about $20 billion on Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid back the aid.
Quick dial
It went faster than expected, after all.
The station unveiled the successor just two weeks after the ZDF board ousted editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the Bureau wanted to agree on that person.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in Berlin.
However, the station did not confirm this - officially, so as not to preempt the process.
But the role could also have been played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal did not pass the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Bureau.
The result of the vote was not known before the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter went bankrupt on the board of directors with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him, and Brender's loss of the mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although one could have expected it.
The EU's majority on the board of directors had already signaled several weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Resistance to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that under Brender the quotas for monitoring ZDF news broadcasts had fallen.
Until shortly before the election there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
More recently, 35 state lawyers have intervened in the debate, deeming Koch’s actions unconstitutional.
It was useless.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for the Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the main ZDF studio.
After Brender, who was elected journalist of the year by Medium Magazine on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced they were filing a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the chief executive's staff proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from the ZDF’s supervisory boards.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, commanded the board a clever chess move - immediately after Brender's dismissal, he strongly criticized the board for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing the face of both Schächter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without getting into the suspicion that the party had been pushed into office.
In party arithmetic Frey is already ranked among the left liberals.
Studying Gets Rid of Harp
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, the Ministers of Culture finally went to the Länder on Thursday: At a conference of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors, both sides agreed that there is a will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the exam load: In principle, each study module should be completed with a single exam.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed, and a "real and defensible rate" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to create a more flexible common structural mandate for bachelor's and master's degrees.
Land deviations should cease to exist.
Less Exams
Since the start of the student protests in June, the ministers of culture and the university rectors had winged words about better studies in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council has decided that the number of exams will be partly drastically reduced: "Each module will usually be completed with only one exam," says the 30-page report, which is partly to re-regulate the approval of study fields.
"A significantly lower test load," said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the Accreditation Board, "is to be stopped from the erroneous development that significantly reduced the complexity of the study."
To do this, the "demand of study" should in the future be the "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and contents must be "hardly checked" to "not unnecessarily restrict students' choice of
of seminars."
Students should have a “demand for space that enables and supports self-initiative”.
The rules are to apply to the approval of new fields of study, after review, but also for existing fields of study.
They need to be “re-accredited” every five years – but that means it will take until 2015 for all fields of study to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies across Germany are responsible for this, subject to accreditation councils set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the federal states to act on the agencies in such a way that the curriculum is not too large and the examination regime is not strict.
In the individual Länder, universities and colleges have already agreed with the provincial ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
From the money, universities should primarily pay for consultancy programs and study counselling, and strengthen examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to her, only one exam should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the studies should be even more flexible, in order to guarantee the recognition of exams from other universities and to facilitate the accessibility of the master's degree.
By the end of next year, the demands of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of the Juso Higher Education Groups urged that the formation of education policy should not take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word" should also be spoken by students as concerned persons.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of Higher Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn Resolutions did not go far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a superstructured master’s degree.
Secondly, the Länder must ensure that today’s generation of bachelor’s degree students will have ample opportunities tomorrow in master’s degree programs with the best possible study conditions, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The states must employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their opinion on free access to the master’s programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting into and out of Germany is nice, almost no control...” is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who in this exhilarating piece of language thematizes the experience of a dissident who gained his freedom but lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, and worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A significant non-literary upheaval took place last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich about “German literature in Romania in a mirror and the broken mirror of its security files.”
Apparently insecure and confused, Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to his fellow writers, the Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, that he was a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts at recruitment began inconspicuously, at first in 1971.
I am, Söllner went on, "someone who hasn't resisted Securitate's attempts at intimidation enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is the undercover agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary dealings with the mechanisms of dictatorial government, the literary scene, and in particular the Romanian community of German authors, is shaken by a case that identifies the depth and shamefulness of control and the political system behind it.
Werner Söllner is not, at least as far as the current state of knowledge is concerned, just the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
Secret Agent Walter played a role in the Securitate files, said Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive influence on himself of Secret Agent Walter.
“He was cutting me down in all the essential points for him,” Markel says.
He has a moral duty to make this remark.
Söllner's statement in this form and before this audience was unexpected, but absolutely surprising, confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when she read her own 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Securitate spies.
The touches, it can be assumed, will speculate and in some cases probably know which name is hidden behind the code name Sorin, Voice and also Walter.
Apart from the domestic, in the meantime very sure inspection of Stazi files, the handling of the Securitate control legacy is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been thwarted and curtailed.
One of Birthler’s offices, which corresponds to the National Securitate Components Processing Council (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issue of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 there is a law governing the management of folders.
The fact that former members of Securitate are still very influential in Romania was confirmed by an interview with Herta Müller, in which one of the former heads of Securitate from Timisoara spoke negatively about the laureate.
She is said to be psychotic, after all, she was only questioned once.
The disgrace of power was expressed in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, there are unavoidable questions about the Söllner case, as in the case of the concealed offense.
The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes us expect that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the desire for knowledge than by the assignment of guilt and shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Saturated deposit Champions League
It looked as if a clean-dressed salesman had come from a cute Christmas party where a sports goods manufacturer was handing out candy as a new VfBr Christian Gross coach, accompanied by an orange-coloured sponsor's bag, was boarding a midnight, quarter past midnight in a summoned C-Class Mercedes.
A man with a striking baldness let himself be drove around a strange city because of him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with luck was a 55-year-old man too little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we will continue to work.
Or it's just beginning.
In the words of just three days engaged Swiss: "We have reached the eight-finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to a 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be dazzled by the success: It will be a brutally tough fight against the descent."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mainz the performance from the royal class even on an ordinary league day.
And prevent obvious weaknesses after three quick goals Marica (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Drawing
The Champions League Finals (Match 16/17 + 23/24 February/ Match 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s successor’s sudden ascension will thus be preserved.
Not just with the supposed healer, who gave the uncertain Stuttgart professionals, within a short period of time, self-confidence, a willingness to commit and the joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be more courageous, explained soul healer Gross, a simple-sounding successful recipe that under the influence of therapist Babbel proved no longer effective.
Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, admitted that "when a new impetus comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a weeks-long hiatus due to injury, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and work practices of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Obviously, Babbel lacked it.
VfB Stuttgart not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before there was a nasty wake-up after a 0-4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt reminded that while one goal was achieved in the season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not out of the water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to weekend events that came to life in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions made by others and not by Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He threw a weak leadership to the board and decided to change coach after pressure from teenage fans.
Even the cancellation of his day off after the matches, Lehmann described as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formulate pure egoism," Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the goalkeepers.
The 40-year-olds will no longer enjoy life.
In any case, they are one with the others that without the work of the deposed coaching team, such a strong and combative performance would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants had “a big share of the success,” Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously – and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
Category: World Heavyweight Championships
A passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked with the words and gestures of world champion Vitali Klitschko.
However, after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The ruling of the arbitrators was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson by a unanimous vote on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
This is Klitschko's third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Earlier, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t come out the way everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional duels, twice defeated due to injuries.
Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th battle.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bern arena, Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko drove a 2.02-meter-high duel mainly with his left hand.
Eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of Klitschko's era before the duel, was retreating before the strikes of the world champion, so Klitschko could not strike the decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
All in all, Passive Johnson did little to challenge, and he was just trying to get into the next round.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his strikes rarely hit the world champion.
Still, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000 to fight Klitschko for a full twelve laps.
The challenger took care of the riots in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschko as "a disgusting zombie" who "doesn't do anything right."
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion was provoked, removing Johnson's sunglasses from his nose, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained undefeated after his return on 11 October 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreol of the United States in defending titles.
In this fight, I received only one shot and I am physically in good shape, Klitschko justified a quick return to the ring.
His dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Bratr Vladimír is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt is worn by Britain’s David Haye, who deposed Nikolai Vulayev in November.
Haye canceled a fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promotional company is reportedly planning a fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Leading attack from the opposition: Greens faction chief Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) call on the Chancellor to provide explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two tankers in September was "consciously false," Greens faction leader Jürgen Trittin told ARD's "Tagesschau" news program on Saturday.
Let's call it the usual expression: He lied.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report that Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not only about the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. airstrike, which was demanded by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, killed or injured up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel needs to explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Bundestag - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have endorsed this new strategy, has been called for by Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised about the ministry’s account of the background to the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs correctly and completely informed about the background of the attack on the tankers.
Officially, they were supposed to deny the existence of NATO reports and withhold sensitive details from the minister.
However, it was reported from the vicinity of the two senior officials that they had even brought to the attention of the Ministry of Defence several reports, including a two-page document by Commander Klein and a report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that in the meantime Wichert should have asked in a letter for clarification of the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be dealt with in the investigative committee of the Bundestag, which will be appointed next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others cannot see or hear.
It is not only the mentally ill or drug addicted who draw the line between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest imaginations and fantasies.
But those who experience dream states in their wakefulness, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in today’s Western world they tend to think of themselves as crazy or drug addicts, or at least as strange.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in drug addiction.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination, and reality are merged here and there.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, at best called visions, at worst delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of delusions, psychoses and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise when the balance of the brain’s neuronal transmitters – primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and acetylcholine – is derailed and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of dreaming in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "the great similarity of delirium with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, delusions of the senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and strikingly colorful.
Gravity has no power over it, it floats by the ceiling of the room.
He feels kicked.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red grimaces, cherishing their teeth.
He chases him, kicks him with heavy, fiery shoes, throws him against the walls, feels pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls the two cables out of the stereo, loops them in a loop and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop lets go.
Learn, yelling chorus voices ripping his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was triggered.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressed, taking medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness and has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fears and the deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people get schizophrenia at least once in a lifetime, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most people with disabilities can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, and they get into an over-awakened state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Hearing voices – voices that command, comment, or conduct dialogues – is particularly common.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain is unable to filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
Perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the University of Heidelberg’s General Psychiatry Clinic.
The schizophrenic is at the center of everything, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible with them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience a hallucination
Otherwise than in a dream, says Fuchss, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality, which one perceives in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience occurs within a real framework.
Scientists still face a riddle as to why our brains are doing this kind of sweep.
Exceptional states can lead everyone to lose touch with reality in the short term, Fuchs says.
Not everyone develops into a psychotic.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that the affected people have minimal brain damage.
It is believed that neuronal maturation of the brain will be damaged at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery as to how a neuronal system disorder will occur, which has not manifested itself for many years.
The role is also played by environmental influences - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if there is a disposition to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, as they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains are boiling
Crazy is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf".
Hallucinations belong to the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, illnesses such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma are also common.
Surprisingly, even the brain of a healthy person hallucinates under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or little suppressed; when our brain is boiling or when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries with love or other other exceptional states.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the local grammar school.
Quite a normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the patterns and the voices.
During breaks, she may be approached by a cologne with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her can see and hear this boy.
This shy girl is considered a tight-knit dreamer, but Sarah K. does not dream, she knows it.
He's awake, he hears and sees the boy, just like he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night the appearances are rather depressing
Often, delusions are a burden.
As she sits in the classroom, she can’t watch the lesson how many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else audible and visible on the board of mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are rather depressing.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, he is often unable to distinguish whether he is awake or already asleep, whether the images he sees, grimaces, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and feet, arise before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she hasn’t gone crazy.
Delusions are also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is deprived of stimuli, they will be more likely to have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain does not have enough work and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she calls dad since she thought for herself was not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain regions that process real perceptions and sounds are active, it is difficult for afflicted people like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain work, which is why it acts so real.”
Also night dreams are evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Therefore, Kasten advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The boundary between dream and hallucination
In our world too focused on awareness, the imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - the illusion is also the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard investigated the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered dream consciousness.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person considers real and cannot even distinguish them from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis at full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and of himself, for example by a persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between a dream and a hallucination.
Since it is not possible to manage a situation in reality, the worlds will change, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intense form of sensory support and sensory transference in some unbearable situation that allows people’s own ability to form, to pass in an instant into a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Also, art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of Hearts) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness went on a several-day journey, while his body lay motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he had created, visiting alien times and places: becoming an old man confined to a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility who make narcotics out of blood.
On a motorcycle, he is abducted by a Greek man to his homeland, surfing on a hotbed in the Alps on a hospital bed, and meets a Korean mobster.
It dives completely into the imaginary story, everything is real, even later in the memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are still clear after years and in unimportant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile even in the waking state our inner images of external reality are.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, “can lead to a distortion of what we call reality.”
A fact that can also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
The new head of Kallen is a transitional solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding will be 100% owned by the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda has long seen his business in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says 69-year-old SPIEGEL man.
We dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked only afterwards.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put your children at the head of 7,500 employees if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would step down from the chairmanship of the board of directors from January and named Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a board member of Burda since 1999.
He was in charge of technology first.
Later, with the Treasury section, responsibility for the company's assets was added, and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also Direct Marketing, Foreign Affairs, Printing and Finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would have been 42 today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to “bring us through 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
The holding should still be 100% family owned in the future, Burda says.
Referring to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from extinction: "It has always affected companies that have been infected by the desire for capital, who have speculated and thought that they can become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had “dreams of world power,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as the political preceptor of this country like Springer was, and I don’t want to play the World League with Time, these deals are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is approaching and this is the time to find out what celebrities are wearing and adjust their festive wardrobe to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to emphasize the figure, which is necessary to note.
We make a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Hall, founded the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE' (Logistics for the introduction of electric vehicles) office will set and manage the roadmap for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will ensure the agreements in the field of mobility, will handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, collect views and work results in the sectors involved.
Overall, the purpose is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electrical cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in a project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government as part of the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa when it comes to promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in the European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects, e.g. G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'peaceful period' for the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is awaiting a "peaceful period".
In the Prime Minister's 2009 economic report, Zapatero summarised the measures that had been put in place during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Competitive Plan for the automotive industry, we would be facing a state of abandonment, the closure of some of our main manufacturing enterprises,” he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of the individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm for this industry, which is our main export sector, is foreseen in the future," he added.
In this sense, he noted that the competitive plan, which is part of the Integral Plan of the automotive sector (PIA), has allocated 800 million for projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment exceeding 3 billion euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government measures in support of the requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is implemented in cooperation with autonomous regions and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan allowed to reduce by 6% the average level of emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, and secured a "significant increase" in entries, namely in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Car Show will open in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of motoring.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Casa de Campo in Madrid’s Glass Pavilion.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real treats for collectors and curious people.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renovation; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renovation; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialized company of Mercedes Benz.
Tests of eligibility in the exterior
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports performances, fitness tests, presentations and auditions.
Eligibility tests will also be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in a customized circuit outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining a sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative impact on sports style.
And that’s why the Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system – also christened kaki-Stop-, which is a device that is currently only available with a 2.0 150 hp petrol engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics, which it achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent in the Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
Using a set of tools and a console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style is partly reminiscent of the style also presented by the Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that the Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and specifically even more with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system is currently only available with a two-liter petrol engine and a 150 horsepower six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very soft, characterized by a reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most popular Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a number of serial elements.
In the case of standard equipment, it is necessary to mention especially the lane monitoring system (RVM), which prevents the formation of blind angle, thrust and stability control, speed control, light-sensitive internal mirror, on-board computer with large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth slainy.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an additional fee of 1,500 euros: adaptable dual-xenon lights and BOSE sound system with a CD holder, among other components.
CONCLUSION
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and a high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more kilometers per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a gasoline engine 2.0 and 150 hp.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21,770 for the Luxury version and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. has a red carpet, soft as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand 'Nine'. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view mail, without the ability to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid for an iPhone data plan, for example.
After its success, the company began offering two new devices: one dedicated exclusively to Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was unveiled yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is limited in the same way as its American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The monthly cost of maintenance is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or to look impatiently for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) in order to view mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission has repeatedly called for lowering roaming tariffs to make them accessible across Europe, which is still not having the desired effect.
There is a legitimate concern about using data services outside the home country.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (interestingly, it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) will achieve this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various offers to compensate for their data network.
The Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and paid for on purchase, not after months.
And that’s exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it’s an option to purchase with permanent access as Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on my phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the point of view of the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
The Color That Michelle Loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama, she chose a dress and coat in this color, the same color she chose when accompanying him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with shimmering effects - in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of an Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes both models significantly different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
They also change accessories: green shoes with a medium high heel, nowa similar model, but in gold color.
He also wears a variety of hairstyles: this kartdrdol, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related maternity problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among women of younger age who are planning to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and careers of Spanish women', conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to maternity.
The study highlights that at the beginning of a partnership cohabitation there are many differences in views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, as well as on the type of work.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner earlier, give birth to their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable jobs, especially in the public sector, postpone cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted most of their life to achieving their stable employment and therefore had to postpone the cohabitation of partners and the arrival of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong impact on maternity, although it has a minor impact on the time it takes to start cohabiting with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage andthe birth of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 and 32.1, respectively.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education marry and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education prefer to get a stable job before marrying and having their first child,” Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan "Because I'm worth it".
Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l, one of the world’s most elegant actresses, joins L’Oréal Paris with other celebrities such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Penélope Cruz.
Even before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Millionaire from the Hut") joined this select club.
The male part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangelina's partner in "Lost").
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, past and present - gathered for the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted best model of the year.
Manuel Vicente Poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Ace Poker' (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente) thirty X-rays of writers he has encountered in his literary life (and in some cases in everyday life).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent spares no excitement or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s enjoyment, even when read repeatedly.
Here are some observations.
Albert Camus: "I have found in the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the pleasure of counter-fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote by his own nature and not by his intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humour, meaningless, as if it were the blade of a knife that nearly killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man has been woven with passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is the spiritual privilege of reaching heaven by the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
Of himself, he said he was the heir to the county landowner, sometimes he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the insane cry of this man from Munich to carry his echo into the night of the twentieth century in his literary form, fleeing from himself and calling to the future and sharply speaking to the worms."
Dorothy Parker once knelt down and prayed, “My dear God, make me stop writing like a woman.”
On his grave were engraved Spencer’s verses: “After effort comes a dream, after a storm a calm harbor, after war a rest, after a full life a death.”
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depressions in his baggage.
The husband completely agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
“No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.”
About Pío Baroja: "What else was going on with Martin Santos but focusing Joyce on Baroja?
What else was Benet up to except having Baroja executed with Faulkner's weapon?
What was the purpose of Celus but to make himself famous at the expense of that man's fame?"
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood, in the Fuenlabrada district, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 walked through a circle and our dog, a crossbreed rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, was kicked twice without a word and severely injured.
Our resentment is all the greater because we see nothing funny in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal, which, moreover, was on a leash.
Moreover, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, also began to worry for her own safety, because such a devil-possessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint against the nearest commissioner, but we doubt that it was of any use, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
The indignation prompted us to announce this fact.
We don’t understand what happens to today’s youth when they have fun tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship, and friendship.
We don’t understand where the good manners, the respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for wearing helmets
Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both entities reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to underline the importance of the use of a helmet, as it is the only means by which head injuries and possibly deaths can be prevented in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin says the campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "means more than just designing and manufacturing even safer products", and confirms that it seeks to fulfill this purpose in other ways, i.e. in the form of an instructional and informational campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of a helmet when riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 motorcycle repair shops will be equipped with signboards to bring them to the attention of the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that road safety "is a constant problem" for the company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheelers and whose main goal is to constantly increase product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and what is more, this is the first increase after 22 months of continuous decline, according to figures from the patronage organization of manufacturers Anfac and dealers Ganvam.
However, a favourable figure is better placed in quarantine, as November 2008 is a considerably poor period for comparison and represented a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pickups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the cloud most damaging to demand hasn’t disappeared, even if it’s bought by private individuals, most of the purchases have been made by small and medium-sized businesses, and almost 100% of these are third-party financing.
In addition to the constraints arising from the closure of the source of bank loans, other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation need to be added.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, support for the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention alsopeople doing business on the trade list of small and medium-sized companies who intend to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam again reminded that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles, as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Retailers expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and, according to calculations, sales for passenger cars and 4x4s will fall by 19%.
The handbrake assistance system is already a mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with ESP stability control, handbrake assist systems, all this will become a mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment for all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others a deadline is set for the elimination of the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, while working in a way that can help prevent many collisions.
The handbrake assist system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects when the driver pushes.
However, it is not always possible to maintain this pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the car parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not press the brake before a collision, and half of them did not use the full brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 pedestrian-related fatalities per year could be avoided.
Reducing this number would be even more striking—according to calculations, one in four accidents with an impact on people would be avoided—after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, in addition to light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if a collision cannot be avoided, the device will affect the brakes as intensely as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones Opel plan to January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably April 8 - as Javier Ortega reported, the American manufacturer warns that it will take more time to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
And as a result, it may happen that the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production facilities are located, will be issued late in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in those days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to reach an agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to Chinese Baic.
Saab will be closed at the end of the year if the sale fails.
Driving with the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
On the basis of this, in the first place, the automatic sliding roof is in a canvas design with manual control, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; further aluminum doors such as the GT3 were used, which means an additional 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to the reduction of the fuel tank from another kilo to another 19 kg, and the addition of sports wheels to a further 7 kg.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means an extra six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means an extra kilogram.
Also available with a PDK dual-clutch transmission, one vehicle with a manually shifted six-speed gearbox was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountainous stretches with many intricate turns.
His behavior can only be classified as inviolable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the vehicle does not press onto the asphalt.
Quite the opposite: we haven’t tested a model so small and light in a long time that can also convey such safety when cornering, even at high speeds.
He's a small athlete capable of warming up his muscles on a short ride for the time needed until we order him to sprint, brake, and re-use the engine...
Whatever we want. Thanks to the steering, which is as communicative as it is accurate, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine according to the will
The sound of the 320-horsepower V6 boxer (10 hp more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced by the possibilities of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used in the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
Curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads through which we pass with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car coped well with the debris.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; however, in some corners we hit ice and gravel at dawn even in the advanced morning.
Definitely, this ultra-light car is one of the most entertaining on the market, as it’s a bit more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70,831.
"Bag Girl"
Girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon series and occasional 'starlette' at the 'company' shows, the singer shows her face of the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basque Country Wins Victory in Israel
She won a brilliant victory in 82-91 while playing on the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus came to the head of her group after the big performance of Mirza Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the team (29).
The Vitoria team succeeded in replacing the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas, or Mico with a large dose of commitment and collective work, although they had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, great accuracy from the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match began in front of the blues, who from the beginning stood on the mark.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli squad very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team opted for Barac's internal play and the work of Eliyahu, who was received by a whistle and applause on returning to his original position to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although "without six" in the rating of Splitter already indicated that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But even though the match was tough until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their field, and 'by Elías's hand they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to the yellows’ return to the sunlight (50-49).
More unsuitable
The Ivanovics, wounded but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to catch their breath, and then a machine gun appeared, Mirza Teletovic, who, with three almost triples in a row and the help of English and Ribas, returned the score to a reassuring number (54–67), which they achieved locally at the end of the third quarter (57–67).
The Alavese have skinned themselves in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to deprive them of their well-deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70–77).
Despite this and with Splitter expelled for foul seIvanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match already had the winner andTel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos and left him the lead of Group B in the Euroleague match, which was marked by three attacks from Unicaja, but above all by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the environment of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion, nor by its rival, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Rubio, brightened the field s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, though the locals' arsenal in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic, and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22–20, minute 13, a moment when the battle between the USABeverley and Williams supporters meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to function and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to injury to Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez burdened the team Unicaja
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
The Impossible Retaliation
The third part was very offensive from Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, proved superiority and even managed to equalize the difference from the match in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the drawbacks, Unicaja's lead and triple points and Lewis's contribution left some hope of winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and supremacy in centimeters in his zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalizebasket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja withered and handed over the leadership to Olympiacos.
How much should you collect for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads from the real estate, employment and motor vehicles sectors in Spain.
The How much should you take? tool calculates the salaries of users based on the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using the form available on Facebook, where you need to put the profession, years of experience, age and the city where the candidate wishes to work.
During the week the app worked, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally “feels poorly paid,” explained Albert Rivera, who is responsible for the product Trovit, in his report.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paying.
A British programmer takes 45,226 euros gross per year and a French programmer takes 31,059 euros gross per year, while a Spaniard receives 24,000 euros gross per year.
The driver also receives a net salary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 per year in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid job in Spain is as a waiter with 11,592 euros net per year, followed by a salesman with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are a driver, a part-time job and a social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, charge d'affaires at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that Mel knows it must leave the embassy, where it has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the elections on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
That same week, however, he attempted to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum that the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, was trying to impose on him.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing sentiment in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not come as a surprise, since this is already a natural state in an environment where executives make decisions about a future that is in itself uncertain.
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market was the monetization of debt by direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could buy offset assets.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended, and without questioning their disproportionate liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into gear, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in the return of a reduction in risky returns.
The movement of the stock exchange and the differences in bonds of the companies again gained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level that they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which once again affected public debt.
Once again, the pressure is on quality, and the U.S., Japan, and Germany have become investors’ chosen havens, expanding the differentiation of eurozone countries against Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but Standard & Poor's came at the time and threatened a new revision of the qualifications of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless in silencing the moral hazard advocates, who once again tried to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy because of the inhibition of the devastating consequences of restricting credit to employment, when in fact a new Thanksgiving day would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirates for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides deficits, elections, and a new government is coming.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member state to default on its obligations.
What makes sense, however, is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to be transparent and to hold its own citizens jointly accountable when extraordinary measures are needed to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalization of the temporary risk premium, after some excesses on the supported positions would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase in the same way as the bonds of European companies, we need not worry.
If European disparities are reduced and ours are further widened, this would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's issue is just anecdotal. When our leading indicators force most studio services to anticipate their renewal scenarios and revise their 2011 ascent scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not bode well for the Spanish economy to live to see this warning fulfilled.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "careful, comrade driver".
Related Sectors
Iberdrola President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before a subcommittee of the House of Deputies, where a strain of these days discusses Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by a speech by President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán made a few remarks to the press regarding the proposal he submitted to the subcommission behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 million by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60,000 million from that date until 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this did not happen, the necessary investments would not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that investments over the next decade should focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
From 2020, the issue is changing and there will be a need to increase the performance.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supporting energies".
Galan, who believes the government-approved sustainable economy bill is in line with the line demanded by the company, did not want to let go like a royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which runs counter to climate change policies.
In his opinion, a "clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "accurate" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
However, Galan believes that investment decisions, albeit long-term, must be made now, because they are ripening and a stable tax framework is needed to launch them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary Swissport will act as the preferred partner of Irish airlines Aer Lingus for cargo services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet resulted in economic deadlines, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of cooperation yesterday to create a Centre for Innovation in Intelligent Infrastructures.
The association expects an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will be made by Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the research of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona aims for its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is battling for its first concession on a highway in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water company.
The construction in question is a tunnel estimated at A$1,700 million (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The five-kilometer tunnel in Brisbane, Australia, on the east coast, has become the nearest option for ACCIONA to settle in the country as a construction and concession highway company.
City Hall wants the tunnel to be completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to initials in English) for further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has the final list of candidates for the construction and operation of tolls.
The bids are expected to be submitted in May, with an expected investment of A$1,700 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million), and in the final phase three companies with a significant presence in European construction are competing.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia’s largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s largest specialists in underground construction.
Northern Direct with the presence of British Laing O’Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues are in the game against Acciona.
The third and last company to pass through the sieve is called LBRJV and is owned by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), also the local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and a major company specializing in civil construction Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large-scale construction and privatisation, but carries with it a clear difficulty of entry other than through the intermediary acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of the cited Leighton.
Millions of Assets
Acciona bets on the geographic area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of businesses that build and operate desalination plants in Adelaide with a budget of $700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the combined energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The toll road promoted by the City of Brisbane's Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link (northern junction), is to connect the west highway from Toowong to the Kelvin Grove circuit (see map) of the 5 km tunnel.
The calendar set by the local administration is scheduled for the summer of 2010 and the start of work in December next year.
Although this paid passage would be opened in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the works is planned until 2016.
The tunnel was started in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit for Hochtief, as it announced yesterday a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
ACS, through its local Leighton subsidiary, will put into operation the infrastructure of the national broadband network with a fiber optic cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide the German company with work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work was just beginning and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O’Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centers for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awarded tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, received a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million grant for the construction of a 2.1-kilometer tunnel for the motorway in Slovenia.
The company received the contract a few days after carrying out works on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
Work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got an ad in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services for the last two years to Sra. Rushmore for an estimated amount of three million euros per year, the railway company said.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year.Sra. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves in a tender announced by Renfe, of which four went to the finals, among them TBWA, which was responsible for creating the ad over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for designing and producing the campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million for braking competition
France’s competition regulator has fined France Télécom <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the country’s Caribbean regions.
According to the institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the verge of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has bought more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the Office, which oversees competition, considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that, consequently, there has been a recurrence.
The App Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet in order to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought in 476.4 million Madrid and Barça since the beginning
The Champions League has been a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned $476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition distributed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million among the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in this event since the establishment of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money it received for participation, and the only one, along with AC Milan, to win the main prize three times.
The Catalan current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992 is the fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that charged the most money for participation in the last Champions League.
Both of them lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to win the most money through Champions, despite having won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
DISTRIBUTION
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to earn 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA donates $413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received $2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million for their presence alone, in addition to an additional 550,000 euros for each match they participated in.
There is also a prize premium (800,000 euros) and a draw (400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four will receive $4 million.
The champion will earn 9 million, while the second finalist 5.2 million.
Thus, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four assigned places.
The champion of last year will receive 40% of the allotted money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has announced the details of its offer to buy shares, with the help of which it wants to gain a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,5025 per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this deferral of 1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos' shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa evaluates the company by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumas, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the sauce further changes the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to stay on the verge of possible bids to buy and settle the judicial swings of its former leaders, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the election of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a high position in a food business.
This is a newly created post, which will be directly subordinate to the group president.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company continues to be immersed in a legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the companies of the Salazar brothers.
De facto, it is impossible to shred the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new transfers of funds
As for the Salazars’ credit, yesterday the former council members Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified before the National Court and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV allows option to exclude Paternina, who participated in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized the exclusion, in which Inversora Mer participates, of Federico Paternino on October 9.
The Authority explained that it authorised this operation because it understood that its conditions corresponded to the applicable standards and considered that the content of the explanatory brochures submitted following the amendments introduced on 2 December was "sufficient".
The CNMV clarified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company’s capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized, which could not be transferred in any way until the offer was concluded, which he specified that the price was set by Federic Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for car valuation
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car repair shops make money.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insured event are towed to a repair shop, where an expert has to estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated job.
Manually calculate the cost of repair from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Service providers and solutions for estimating claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information that manufacturers provide to them in order to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain Audatex, from the American group Solera is the leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of valuation tools and development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, sales director of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers work in Spain, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is steadily increasing, as more versions, variants and motor solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
This is a very feverish work, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "punch out" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week, if the process is very fast.
As for the minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but not, for example, Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of rolling stock in circulation, they exceed 99%.
Audatex has eight centers around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million a year in developing these databases.
2.5 million data are added every month and customers receive updates every two days.
Processing this huge stream of information allows businesses to make different uses and deliver different products.
The most common uses focus on repair and maintenance, but there are also country-specific tools to manage spare parts or to calculate the sales or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
With the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This business offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard premium valuation solution designed for connoisseurs.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is paid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.75 for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
After that, each insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow full identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to discard vehicles with a total insured event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying tendencies, performing geodemographic analyses, or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many modelsCertain brands have been serviced due to an accident or how many have suffered a serious insured event over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for connoisseurs, as well as providing digital images, access to parts or prices, and the official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, accidents or maintenance of cars.
Gt Guia valuation is its reference historical product in the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and accounted for 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the office installation in Paris began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of her brother's origins are in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global invoicing of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $ 557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange for $1,000 million, and now its shares are valued at a total value of $2,400 million.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's index.
Online auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an online base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insured event.
The operation envisaged subscribing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million of the company’s 85% capital, which could expand next year by the remaining 15%.
The purpose of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively guaranteed to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, repairers, spare parts sales and professional resellers who must register before starting operations.
Established in 1996 in Germany, the platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among the main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site currently has more than 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been discarded cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with a historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been discarded, after preliminary driving.
Service budget in four steps
With Auda-Taller, Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding a spare part, creating a budget, and generating a budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for older professionals who are more or less reticent to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, for use, you need a computer with an Internet connection.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical representation of the model appears, and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor cost, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include a workforce estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome because it allows, for example, to select a door and turn it to show the inside.
