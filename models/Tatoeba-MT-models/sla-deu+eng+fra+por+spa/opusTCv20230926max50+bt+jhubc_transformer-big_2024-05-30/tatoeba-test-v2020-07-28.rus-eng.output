Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to win time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, while living among the people, spoke a terrible, from the Jewish point of view, Galilean dialect of Aramaic instead of Hebrew, thus showing the inadequacy of claims about the existence of any sacred language, the use of which in prayers especially brings closer to God.
Eventually, Tom changed his mind.

In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.

I didn't fall asleep until after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
It wasn’t as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake up Tom.
They say the movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.

Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I love the bitter pepper.

I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.

Tom stood in front of Mary.
Take some more.

The typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was doomed to death.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Power is in Tom's hands.

Do it before it gets dark.

That's the truth!
Let's go get the tree.

Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he says he is?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Bluetooth, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could have stayed longer.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad has happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He was wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You're not allowed in this room.
You had other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.

He got hurt when he fell.
We are impartial.

Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her in my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald’s is world-famous for its hamburgers.
Tom gave Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have an opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?

Have some cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
He wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom is a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was it too easy?
What Alice faced while waiting for an answer was a sudden howl. It was a loud noise, so sharp that it tore her eardrums, and so loud that it reached heaven.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary take things to the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom was reluctant to give Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You should have done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
The stone was so heavy that I couldn’t lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
He will respond as he responds.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I am learning is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom is the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President reigns for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Couldn't you sort that out?
And Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
There's 20 floors in the building.
If you're not coming, I'm not going.
You wouldn't happen to know when Tom's coming back, would you?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a minute?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She's not gonna fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I will be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom did not have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as stubborn as an ass.
I think I can count on you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a hunch that Mary was bringing her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but there was a girl on the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with children.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom's got a little moustache.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't piss her off.
I'd rather stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom has to go to Boston next week.
Do not walk in a strange land.
Tom was watching in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom staying?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
What do you think of your new class?
Be afraid of your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough to eat.
We need a new curtain in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
That's a risk we can't afford.
I'd like to talk to you about something that's important to both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom swam?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it very often.
I hope we don't do that again.
How many times have you helped Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it's opening time.
I'm not sure what size it is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas stepped away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary had been adopted.
Who does not admire them?
He and I were crying.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like that?
From milk you can make butter, cheese and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I've smoked before.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary's happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Have you thought about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I'm eating like a pig.
Can you say that in human language?
No one was hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
Not a single snowflake in a snow avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve the problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
This time spit.
I really liked this book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she would stay the night.
Tom didn't tell the policeman his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was in pain.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him. Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl had a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.
I called you here to ask a question.

Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.

Tom should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you're gone.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.

Don't worry, the test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don’t know which book to choose.
Tom didn’t understand anything.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He is dressed in a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I'm gonna have to wait.
Yesterday was a Sunday, not a Saturday.
Does anyone here know them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his shortcomings.

It's all right, man.
There are many wide avenues in this city.
What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She has a double chin.
We cannot force people to do that.
Let me take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I hate this color.
Are they sleeping together?
We are very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
Neighbors complained.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never spoken to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has flaws.
I wonder why Tom would do that.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom isn't the only one from Boston here.
Will you support me?
What don't you like about this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We were neighbors once.

Where did you even find him?
The meeting was delayed.
I recognize you.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!

Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?

I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you associate your childhood with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the floor jack.
I'd like to lie down.
Lend me some notebook papers or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight. I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here tonight.

I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I convinced her to marry him.
I've waited my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane got into the saddle.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had the time, I'd be happy to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You are photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let’s talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
“Hello,” Tom said timidly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in a lot of pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
On the attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don’t have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new sentence is like a message in a bottle: someday it will be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started working in her new office.
Let us take care of that.
I'm assuming you're sitting in my seat.
I planned to do it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink now, isn't it?
My parents don't like my way of dressing.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
It's gonna be interesting.
I hit him skillfully and hard.
Is it worse?
It's inexpensive.
Can I hold your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom stayed up all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
You have to start watching the show when all the seasons are over!
Road accidents happen every day.
Where did you go skiing?
Were you at the hairdresser's?
The prospect is depressing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ballpoint pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Go away.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed the exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The footballer made a big mistake.
Are they coming, too?

The explosion shook the entire building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged.
That's my cat.
Do you already have children?

Tom is a conceited idiot.
It keeps me up at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I guess you need some help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat go.
I know you're all cowards.

Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I have no doubt.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom rubbed the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
It's the nicest I've ever met.
How much did it cost?
I need to see you now.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.

Tom doesn't swim very well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a shadow of himself.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom doesn't really want to go to Boston with us next week.
Don't let them in.
Anything can happen.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm just a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Paul kissed Lily on the lips?
Why don't you go in there?

The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw away my PlayStation.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Don't move!
What's your favorite TV show?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for bothering me.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's on fire!
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father is a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog is yours.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm gonna go over to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to disturb him.
The officer instilled courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying something like that right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've cooked grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why would they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became famous.
Everyone knew that already.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was who I thought she was.
Tom showed the policeman his driver's license.
I get my hair cut every month.
I told you, I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's a sour apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalog.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Do you take the job home?
According to mythology, Prometheus stole the sacred fire from the gods.

All passengers managed to get out of the bus before it caught fire.
I want to help you sort this out.
You speak French better than I do.

You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We accept checks.
My bike is gone.
The stars glittered in the night sky.
I don't think Tom's gonna win.
"Eh, you're so bored here." - "No, my boy, everyone's looking for this world." - "Here I am! Your Majesty, Ganon and his servants have seized the island of Koridai." - "Hm-m. What can we do..." - "As it is written, only Link can defeat Ganon?" - "So what can we do?" - "Hey!" - "Hey!"

Tom slept without blankets.
Pray for us.
What music do you listen to in the car?
That's what I was told three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French Revolution began during the reign of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It will depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He is old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our city was shrouded in smog.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We were talking about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, there is no food.
It will snow tomorrow.
You should have quit smoking a long time ago.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are noobs, they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like the bike?
I thought Tom was awake.
Tom was not allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Hurry, please, Tom's waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She looks very much like Marilyn Monroe.
I know who we can turn to for help.
I'm stronger than you are.
She was deeply saddened when she looked back on her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I didn't see her.
I really loved him.
Tom and I nodded in agreement.
In politics, respect is hard to earn, but easy to lose.
Stop acting like a child!
Let's go.
They begin to believe their own lies.
Don't pick him up.
Tom wants to dye his hair.
I've never seen her here before.
Why should I work with Tom?
I think it was your fault.
Do you think this is the best way to govern?
If I tell you how it is, they'll kill me.
Reading is a habit that, once acquired, will never be lost.
Tom can stay in Australia for another week.
There is not a single thing in the world that cannot teach us anything.
I haven't paid them yet.
Let's hope it's the last time.
If your answer is right, it means mine is wrong.
Are you sure Tom can do that?
F = ma is Newton's second law.
What do you have against her?
He likes to sing.
I've got some tails to clean.
Is Tom okay?

Neither Tom nor Mary learned French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.

This soup is delicious, isn't it?
A huge crowd of people was waiting.
There's a bottle in the fridge.
I still can't believe Tom hates Mary.
Tom didn't say when he'd be here.
Tom likes you very much.
Can you do that for me?
There's not much I can do for you right now.
I'm here because I was asked to come.
Shortly before the explosion, a man was seen behaving suspiciously.
He sits with his legs crossed.
I definitely heard a scream.
There are many foreign tourists in Asakusa.
I wrote this for Tom.
You're not married?
Tom must have been drunk.
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
He's no richer than I am.
If only I could tell you!
She missed the train.
In the summer I go to the sea and in the winter I go to the mountains.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
You know all about me.
An elderly person lives alone.
You're so stupid.
He almost never gets angry.
You're kind of tense.
I don't know how to do that.
What would make you happy?
I'll be there on Monday, Tom on Tuesday, and Mary on Wednesday.
Is it safe to eat raw eggs?
What is the height of the Empire State Building?
Hey, how are you?
Neither Tom nor Mary did anything illegal.
Unfortunately, it's true.
Can we lock this door?
I don't know what to say.
What are you all doing here?
The police arrested the robber.
Keep Tom in the dark.
I'm not going to school today.
You two come with me.
Tom drank red wine and Mary drank white wine.
I read the article.
It used to belong to them.
He doesn't even notice me.
He's a disgrace to the whole city.
Did you make it?
The pigeon whispered everything.
That's my favorite.
I don't think anyone's noticed what Tom's doing.
I will not sell my soul.
This isn't my house.
They should move fast.
I think you paid too much for it.
I'll take it.
I wanted to eat pizza.
She said she didn't want to sleep.
You don't have time.
You are superior to all of us.
I was born here.
I asked my boss to raise my salary.
Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused?
Could you walk me out?
Mary covered her face with her hands.
What if he's wrong?
Tom looks a little like his dad.
We never talked about that.
I know what that means.
I had to act quickly.
Mary said she would do it herself.
Don't you remember me telling you all this?
These girls just want to have fun.
I spoke to the doctors in French.
Robots are used to make cars.
Tom's punctuality has never been different.
Tom and Mary are asleep.
They were all amazed to see me there.
Drink to my health!
He cut himself with a knife yesterday.
The singer suddenly switches to a falsetto.
You don't have a fever.
Thank you very much for this information.
I can't afford to buy a new bike, so I'm gonna have to go with the old one.
Tom doesn't think there's life on Mars.
I can't spend all day here.
I became a lawyer to help people.
I went to see Dan.
I met him a few months ago.
These gloves belong to him.
She does not look more than sixty years old.
Can you trust her?
She's a talented singer.
I've done this many times.
Don’t play poker with them.
Tom's very upset about something.
I'll call her right away.
I want to dedicate this song to Tom.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
He held the rope with both hands.
Tom doesn't pay attention to Mary.
Tom lives in the same building as me.
Don’t blame others for your mistakes.
I thought Tom was coming to see us.
I never lied to her.
Tom burned his fingers on the stove.
They took her.
Mary could have done it if she'd tried.
Tom asked Mary where she wanted to go for lunch.
Can I have one too?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his lessons?
Tom likes oranges.
This is the current plan.
We want Tom to say yes.
I think about them all day.
I can neither read nor write.
How's Tom doing now?
Tom left on time.
Tom stayed there for a few days.
The X-ray showed that two fingers were broken.
Tom said Mary's really hungry.
Tom should have gone there.
It was a fantastic day.
I said good night.
Try to escape.
Let's wait a little.
Laws must be respected.
Tom made Mary wait a long time.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I'm doing this for the money.
We were just talking about you.
Excuse me, can I get the check?
I thought you'd laugh.
Mary wore two sweaters.
If you see Tom, you'll understand.
I want to take them to work.
I'm sure he's smart.
Which way should I go?
Were you born there?
I'm not hearing the same thing anymore.
He said it was nine.
The butterfly flew.
There's no time for that.
Both of these suitcases are mine.
Prices are rising.
She's not wrong.
Today I'm finally going to tell Tom what I'm really thinking about him.
Don't be mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Do you like to sing?
I love the winter.
Show me a picture of her.
They trusted you.
He was born in America.
Tom doesn't think so, of course.
He called me just as I was about to go to bed.
If I can do it, so can you.
The sun warmed his skin.
Tom promised to come back.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
