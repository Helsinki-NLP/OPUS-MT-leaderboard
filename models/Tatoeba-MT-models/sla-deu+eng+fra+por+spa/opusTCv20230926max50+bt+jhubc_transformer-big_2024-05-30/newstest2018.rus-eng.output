The President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed the law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in the procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address the very acute problem of non-compliance of customers with their obligations in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not receive payment under already fulfilled state and municipal contracts was ubiquitous.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who entered into unfunded contracts, tried in every way to evade the obligations on payment and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic throughout the country.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders, the Prosecutor’s Office has submitted 9,700 submissions, according to the results of their consideration, 4,500 officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 have been brought to administrative responsibility, 75 submissions have been submitted to the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural inspections, 46 of them have been opened criminal cases.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
And these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
To fabulous debts led to numerous, systematic delays in payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a tender for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The man invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but he did not receive the money on time.
The result is a growing financial pile of debts on wages, taxes, loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought help from the prosecutor’s office.
In some regions, the problem has been eliminated as much as possible.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor’s office operates in the mode of manual crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally holds out-of-town meetings with representatives of the local authorities, during which all violations discovered by prosecutors are thoroughly examined and measures are taken to remedy them promptly.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in Regard to Establishing the Administrative Responsibility of the Customer's Officials for Violation of the Term and Procedure for Payment for Goods (Works, Services) in Purchasing to Ensure State and Municipal Needs" will be able to qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public customers, which was signed last week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by an official of the customer of the period and procedure for payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novelties in practice.
Civil Rights Advocacy Group Announces Traffic Warning in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement reads: “The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Travellers’ Warning, valid until August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri citizens to be particularly cautious and cautious when traveling across the state due to a number of dubious incidents and racist backgrounds.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the movement warning was prompted by a recent Missouri law that made it harder for people to win lawsuits related to discrimination, as well as the state’s law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities.
“Your people are being subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on roads because of their skin color, beaten and killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, told the Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization against the state of the United States.
The group cited incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was killed in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while on a state trip, and the Missouri State Police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
“The purpose of the warning is to keep people aware of the situation and alert their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared one way or another, whether they take the bail money with them or tell their relatives that they are traveling through the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, making it the sixteenth state to report hate crimes.
The move warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that will make it harder to prosecute a legal entity for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after those states enacted new immigration control laws that required local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said was meant to increase the number of racial checks.
Traffic warnings are usually issued by the State Department in relation to other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unknown gunmen fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters citing the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
Two people, including one policeman, were killed and three people were injured in the shooting.
All wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was arrested, the second managed to escape.
Rosturizm supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
Head of Rostourism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC TV that he is "positive" about the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage transportation for non-refundable air tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have baggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has baggage," he said.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, you will not have to pay for the transportation of outerwear and a mobile phone in hand luggage.
“It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and declare it, to say that it is to the outerwear, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad or even to some computer will not have a relationship,” — said the head of Rostourism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm on free baggage in case of non-refundable air ticket.
The airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the protection of Baikal that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and contractors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full-fledged rehabilitation of contaminated territories.
"It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the wastewater treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," the president said.
He also added that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of recreation.
“I want to emphasize this: not everything in a row to check, here too, the measure needs to know, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures,” he said.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office reported on the reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
We will remind, on June 15, Vladimir Putin in a direct line said about the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special regime of protection.
About the problems with the conduct of economic activities he was informed by the inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
There will be a new temple in Yugra.
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from representatives of the indigenous small peoples of the North "Rakhtynya", together with residents of the Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a road beacon for fishermen.
According to representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now the domes are installed, church bells are available.
The Igraim EW of the fleet provided transport escort.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as he is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, fishing gives the settlers work, feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school essays as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are the laws in Singapore being enforced?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while the cigarettes are carefully stored in an iron box taken with him from the office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - a hundred meters to it - and throws the bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place is $500 local, Chang said.
You know, since I was a child, I just developed a reflex: you can not throw a candy candy on the bridge, immediately fined.
There are video cameras everywhere now.
And indeed - the pavements of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, as if in a museum.
Three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced to flogging.
What?!
Imagine that.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the buttocks and spent a week in prison.
Corporal punishment is not uncommon.
How Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, understood on the spot observer "AIF".
No one here is thinking about abolishing the death penalty,” explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been indifferent to the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this issue.
If a person transports a large batch of drugs or sells them, he is hanged.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian man was arrested at Changi Airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
The Australian prime minister defended him, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope.
The man was eventually hanged.
After that, drug couriers diligently go around our country.
The fact is that in Singapore, it is assumed that the laws must be observed by ALL, not only modest and poor people.
It doesn’t matter who you are – a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
One option in this case: if you find half a kilo of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a lot of warnings, you are astonished - how many bans in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the prescription (!) of the doctor.
The tourist on arrival will not take away the gum, but it is worth sticking "rubber" in the subway, they will paste a fine of 1 thousand local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around their necks: “I was trashing.”
In addition to the fine, smokers are often sentenced to "exile to the janitors" for a week to clean parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. pays "criminal" who forgot to flush the water in the public toilet, and when trying to cope with a small need in the elevator of a residential building, a special detector is triggered - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the quite exotic laws - prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of a houseplant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers cannot carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how you try, you will definitely violate something.
This is not at all the case,” Mohammed Kabir-Kajariya, the owner of a local travel agency, tries to dissuade me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone attracted for their violation.
Why do they persist?
So that the citizens do not relax.
The observance of the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, then everyone in the chain will be punished: the store owner will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will be hit with sticks on the "back", and the seller will also be beaten and put in prison.
Due to such strict laws, offences in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the policeman will not let go for a bribe, will impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and will be sent to prison for years.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a visitor from the United States was horrified by the general wealth of residents, "frighteningly clean airport" and "cultured nature".
To say, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and you are afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you grasp if you go to the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India area, and all of a sudden - "the pattern break": at the bus stop there are plastic cups.
“What is it?” you wonder.
"That's it," laughed the Singaporeans.
Anything can happen.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you should know that if you are calculated, you will not retaliate - after all, you violated the law.
This is often enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the government in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often grab smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty homeless and beggars.
In our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage in the urns.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the quietest, cleanest and safest city on Earth.
You'll think.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was strapped to the wheel until they began to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the law.
And we have to think that in Russia, people would also be happy with clean streets, no garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with a public toilet.
Here's the bodily punishment - thank you, don't.
In other words, the laws of Singapore are at least worth a look at.
Nothing sacred?
The Trump White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of a regime change is when it starts fighting with statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the Trump administration’s key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he carried a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a bitter argument with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue itself.
Hordes of boat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he had tried.
But he infringed on its meaning, and especially on the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when poems by Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller moaned at Acosta, “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are referring to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller put the facts right, but as he said, it’s not really about the story.
It is about the current sound of the striking words of Lazarus, the only one in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely / The unhappy garbage of your abundant shores."
Never before have "unfortunate garbage" been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not do literature studies - he made it clear that in America these people are not waiting for Trump.
This controversy about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a controversy about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to put her words on the pedestal of the statue after her death - knew very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was designed to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiled.
The combination of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though changed it back.
The loud Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist who announced Trump’s arrival, argued in 2010 that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neoconservative carrying the flames of America to a world lying in darkness: “Freedom is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to illuminate the way to the United States.”
Contrary to the usual Limbo really hit the point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by the exhausted, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream of hearing.
And, of course, that’s not the kind of perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake praises the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Aileen Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the UK national team
Neil Blake, director of the UK Athletics Federation, said the 16-member Scottish squad at the World Championships would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 London Championship starting on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is being born in Scotland and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand that and we're going to support it as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
“I talked to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks they have to work with what they have done.
The British Athletics Federation: what they have done, you have to work with.
People on the street think the same.
I don’t know why this is happening, but it’s brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish athletes are claiming medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m distance; and Ailead Doyle has been chosen by the team as their captain.
"Aylid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
“Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have left this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Ailid put into it were wonderful.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will run the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Cup, says 16 Scots in the British national team are "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
In front is Laura Muir, who specializes in middle-distance running and broke five British and two European records last year.
She will run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will take part in the 1500m race, is another Scotsman worth paying attention to: behind him is a successful season, in which there were victories in the qualifying competitions of the British national team and in the Annual competitions.
Doyle recalls her first World Cup, when the only Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will qualify for medals and fight for the final.
“The captain of the team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but to know that your comrades voted for you and elected you is a very special thing for me,” she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who have joined the national team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all accomplished athletes who will strive to get on the podium of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be in the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to enter his arena and take part in the competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful.”
Facebook Critics Block: Don’t run for public office unless you’re willing to listen to voter criticism
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn’t stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he did not shut his mouth to his critics.
As Washington said in 1783, “Freedom of speech can be taken away and we, the deaf and the mute, will be led like sheep to the slaughterhouse.”
I will now turn to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit null and void, and the commentary on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well what".
“It’s just Facebook,” many will say.
But it's also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
He is in second place in the approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has shown a firm hand in governing the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also deftly uses Facebook as his primary way of communicating with his constituents, and with jokes on his page shows his bald head after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s page – which is declared as an official public forum and is run by administration employees with taxpayer money – is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Chess defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments was simply moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and haters nagging on the Internet.
The Post has spoken to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their chosen leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lakshmi’s lawyer, Sarma Ramana, from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite commentary that I was disappointed by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the comments section of the article.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it’s a so-called hoax, instead of admitting they’re dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the governor’s subordinates call a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call an “active lifestyle.”
In the era of Facebook, it’s easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
This is a far less dusty job than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical headlines, or arresting and shutting up protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James K. Casheris, the chairman of the Laudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington’s time, the era of affordable postal spending was about the same as the Internet is today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms of "Yuricola", "Valerius", "Belizarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the George Washington Papers online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he wasn’t trying to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech is at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing to it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home amenities at Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for home amenities for the next three days when the Renaissance club in East Lothian hosts the twenty-fifth Scottish Open Golf Tournament for senior athletes.
The native of Northern Ireland, who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links, and moved towards the final round last year until losing to Paul Ilse, is attached to the new venue and serves as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and director Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen the Renaissance club build and we’re seeing it come to success with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
The Englishman Isles looks forward to defending the title for the first time, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won both the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said the Southport player.
“I didn’t manage to try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and it was a very special feeling for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a very special time and we will always remember it.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Athlete Tournament after turning 50 earlier this year, is back in action.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little bit more important,” said a resident of Helensboro Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden.”
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I’m happy with how it’s going so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 per hour if there is one person in the car, and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if there are two or more people.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Some tunnels over the highways, capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on the roads of the United Kingdom.
The transport agency of the country, as reported by the publication Autocar, reported positive results of tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel is made of some of the latest polymeric materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in automobile exhaust.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, expand the use of commercial vehicles on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all atmospheric pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the sentence of the disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years in prison, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the term with a suspended one, explaining its request that Mamayev's disease "prevents his stay in prison conditions".
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with a sentence in a general regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former soldier of the special forces.
On July 19, the court at a visiting meeting in the detention center released the man from custody.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s “golden land”
Bardina Degei does not use the stove when preparing dinner.
She seldom even uses the pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually just puts the sweet potato, which here is called a "note", right into the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and it is here that she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and therefore she was not commissioned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five o’clock in the evening,” she says.
It is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands in front of occupying troops.
The existing pro-independence movement quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control of the region by preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as an abandoned one; the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the provincial capital, to Nabira, and then a five-hour car ride.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians have made it, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tameya.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear these clothes,” says Degei, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
It is also Indonesian gold.
The world’s largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a high-altitude province roughly the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves, the value of which is estimated at 78 billion dollars.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this goldmine and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – particularly frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electric shocks – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of casualties because incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts tightened as Papua’s resources attracted an influx of displaced people from other parts of Indonesia.
The province’s 3.5-million-strong population is 83% Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese shops, "warungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of "gado-gado" vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to keep up with the competition.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the natives of Papua,” explains Abet You, a 24-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, because of work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua — the mother-mother (women) of Papua — have lost their sales market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua’s 29 counties, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice,” says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokovi's October inauguration, Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out on the street singing Christmas hymns at a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke out of the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
Local pastor Javedt Tebay said one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a government election commission building nearby, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed the waita, a dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe: they ran in circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation heated up, internal radio soldiers were ordered to “if the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,” according to an official document seen by TIME but not published in local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kayame, head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, felt danger approaching and called for calm by asking the crowd to disperse home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, a bullet suddenly hit my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
A local resident, Alfius Jouv, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johannes told Time magazine grimly, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
General Yotje Mende, a senior police inspector in Papua, told reporters that his officers were just “protecting” their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more wounded.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi delivered a fervent speech in Jayapura, expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights violations.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
“Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or at the beginning of zero.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed,” he said.
Wiranto then withdrew his words, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through a court of law.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai met such statements with grim mistrust.
“I’ve been questioned four times in the last three years, but there’s been absolutely no change,” says Johannes.
“I am tired.”
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid the military will arrest me, I’m afraid I’ll be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in the neighbouring Paniai district of Deiyai.
In a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of a construction site office owned by the company.
According to police, villagers threw stones at officers, who fired warning shots in response.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation,” said 29-year-old Domingu Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw the rush to deliver the wounded.
“I’ve been at home for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be held accountable and that the mobile police brigade be recalled from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development causes dissatisfaction of the Mei, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green central highland areas of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Free Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to defend Papuan rights by organizing sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM’s top executives come from Paniai, including Thaddeus Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In retaliation, in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and unjustifiably detained by the military under the pretext of “protecting national independence.”
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua, Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly the note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
The ten tubers of the note are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has increased between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport.
Few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village... because there’s no work or money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Panyai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the eyes of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil Longchamp were deported from Papua for “insufficient coherence with relevant organizations” despite being granted rare permits to film.
According to Felim Keane, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises made during Jokovi’s election campaign to lift restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua’s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands — appealed to the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanata Nasir dismissed the group’s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights abuses.”
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Dutch human rights ambassador Kies Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence, begging, “We want freedom,” according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokovi again.
“The Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants the Jokovi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, besides living in the shadow of the threat of a greedy army, are plunged into poverty, and their education and health care are in a pitiful state.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote for Jokowi to be a debt that Jokowi must pay.
“They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not let the guilty forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” Jacobus said without raising his head.
“What else should we have done?”
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Torch"
A fire ravaged one of the world’s tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hurriedly leave a 73-story structure 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that has swept through a high-rise building - which coincidentally is called "Torch" - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no immediate news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarms and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," a resident of the skyscraper named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, firefighters put out the fire at around 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The incident can bring back the safety issues of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of an investigation by the Torch administration after the fire there in 2015, it became clear that the most affected was the coating - external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the grenfell tower insulation system and cladding panels could have accelerated the spread of a fire that killed about 80 people there in June.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
According to the data received by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel enterprises in the North East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, and foreign tourists increased.
Foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram, who is to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a fragment of an article in the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed with the tag "boss milkweed".
An article on how to prevent the "burn-out" of the employee and pay attention to his condition.
If we remember the numerous reports that the host could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who took to reformat "Let them talk", it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes "KP".
As reported, TV presenter Andrei Malakhov is currently on vacation and has not signed an application for dismissal from Channel One.
The situation with the dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, the explosion of a car killed five soldiers
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, reports RIA Novosti.
According to police, on the eve of the evening near the checkpoint of the military in the district of Girishk blew up a car.
It is known about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency occurred in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange office.
Shooting between the attackers and security forces continues.
A diver filmed a shark biting his camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a shark in a video that bit his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose employee is Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula in the northeast of the United States, the portal Necn.
A man while scuba diving tried to shoot a shark on a camera, which he held on a special stick.
Upon noticing the man, the animal, more than three meters long, swam to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did this in order to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that this behavior of the marine animal was new to scientists.
The cause of the mass fight in the Urals military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Center, where a mass brawl took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this beating have already been revealed.
According to the public Mash, appeared on the page "VKontakte", contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 violently fought because of the unfurnished bed.
It all began with the fact that a private named Sayan demonstratively ignored the officer's order to fill the protruding sheet.
On the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young boys were crushed in the barracks by beds and sinks, and glass was broken.
More than 10 people were injured in the mass fight.
The CWO denied the information about the knife-wielding.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the United States carry prohibited items on a plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of passengers knowingly or inadvertently carried prohibited items in their luggage on board through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration’s checkpoints, including at least 6 percent boarding the plane inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study, conducted by charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and involving more than 1,000 people, also found that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly something banned by ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously by ATB employees most often carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted to carrying sharp objects through the search, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men admitted to knowingly carrying illicit drugs onto the plane.
The company said it studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them were accidentally smuggled through airport searches, and how many were doing it consciously.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - smuggling through the search are those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantities.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB removes are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could be considered forbidden to transport books.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA Chairman Pruitt Rejects Intention to Delay Obama’s Emission Reduction Rules
The day after the lawsuit of 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency overturned his decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama, designed to reduce emissions of air pollutants and leading to smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency is now more attentive to the needs of state environmental regulators than in previous administrations.
He did not mention a lawsuit against his previous position filed with the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute revolved around the deadline of October 1, by which states must comply with the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their implementation for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid “non-compliance with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Pruitt, who before being appointed by President Trump to his current post, was Oklahoma Attorney General, has long been known to be a consistent opponent of tightening environmental norms.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms opposed by the chemical or gas and oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Puitt to return to the previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA overstepped his authority in an attempt to delay the Obama administration’s rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and mitigate methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that by dramatically changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA’s obligation to cooperate with the states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet the deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed the deadlines in the course of settling the case,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous post.
“We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take our charter and the power it gives us seriously.”
However, the EPA said Pruitt could at some point again use its “deferral powers and other legal powers” to ensure that the rules “jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of ozone rules.
The bill, approved by the House last month, seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states filing lawsuits against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
“The EPA’s change of course – following our lawsuits – is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by the smog covering their cities,” Schneiderman said.
New York's lawsuit was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ozone at ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's unexpected change of course.
“It’s sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump administration’s ideological campaign to protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress Extends Suspension of All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted for the extension of the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, Congress supported the IAAF Council on the restoration of the WFLA, which issued a report on Monday, in which it recommended that the suspension remain in force.
For the extension of the suspension voted 166 people, against - 21, reports TASS.
The IAAF Board report said that the WFLA had made substantial progress towards meeting the conditions set by the Board for the restoration of membership, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team consisted of 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The VFLA was indefinitely disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
Then the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which spoke about numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the latest report of the IAAF Council in the material "Kommersant" "IAAF has extended sanctions against the VFLA".
Injurious defeat
Within the framework of the 3rd round of the Fonbet-championship of Russia among the teams of the PFL, the Novomoskovsky "Chemist" held a away match against FC Kaluga.
A little more than 10 days ago, rivals played each other in the Cup of Russia, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"The Chemist" was in no way inferior to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat by the pools with a score of 0: 3, many predicted in advance an easy victory for the hosts.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovskys were forced to reckon with themselves and acted from a defensive position, but from a position of strength.
In the 1st half, the kaluzhans built more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexey Sirotin, who several times repelled dangerous blows and gave confidence to his partners.
Unfortunately, in the attack "Chemik" lacked effort and luck to put the defense of "Kaluga" and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to run on counter courses.
The Novomoskovskys played more actively in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team were errors in defense, which allowed the kuluzhans to create a number of acute moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, the Chemist intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaluga played a role - they more competently and in cold blood held the ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the "Chemist" moved the ball to the corner, the feed of which the owners of the field without resistance passed to the goal.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemik" showed a good game, but suffered an insulting defeat.
In front of our team is another departure - August 11 at 7 pm in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov Novomoskovsky will fight with the favorite group "Center" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come back to chemistry!
The place and time of the meeting of Novomoskivtsi - 18:30 near the Magnolia store (Vostochnaya, d.2, corp.
The composition of "Chemist": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, Svetov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to published transcripts of phone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico over the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The US president scolded him for speaking out publicly against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him, “You can’t say that to the press.”
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
A published transcript of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a hot quarrel.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. should accept refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous”, “repulsive” and “dumb” and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot since he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees to the U.S.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of the whole day.”
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia tourists sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, belonging to the airline "Russia", on board which are the bodies of the Russian women killed in Abkhazia, took off at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, reports TASS.
At the place of the final point of departure, the board will be met by employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city hall, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Abkhazia said that all expenses related to the delivery of bodies back to Russia were taken over by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the deceased compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed readiness to pay the relatives of the victims of the explosions of tourists flight and residence in the republic, but the relatives sent to the republic only power of attorney for the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky Gudautsky district in the warehouse of missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, two explosions occurred, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens were killed - Elena Polyakova, born in 1970, and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying severity were taken to medical institutions of the republic.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
The study of the Russian influence on the American elections will be undertaken by a large jury
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to study Russia’s influence in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient for prosecution.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to gather testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016, were previously promised by Mueller himself.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from the meeting with Veselnitskaya he was waiting for a compromise at the headquarters of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but no revealing documents were presented, and in the end it was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.’s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, as any father would do.
Vice-mayor of Penza detained in the workplace
Deputy head of Penza administration Irina Shirshina detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, RIA Novosti reported.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this matter have not yet been received, but the press service of SU SK assured that they will follow soon.
The mayor of Penza has not yet commented on the incident.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has overseen urban planning and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the department of the State Construction Technical Inspection for the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina raises three underage children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no spaceport or launch vehicle in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first man who visited space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk around the planet".
In 2012, the monument was erected in the American Houston near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfuth, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, a monument to Jurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is the name and surname of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and he looks as if he was 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: Activists Will Lose Lynch Trials on Stage to Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the audience in Monroe Village, Georgia, and roared to the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - pulled a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
Piercing cries broke the silence as a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22, is just a staging.
But when a loop was thrown around Roger's neck, almost all the viewers held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again the night when the Kuklux Klans lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey, in 1946.
No one has been convicted of these murders.
“It’s amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years – even though we see them beside us; even though we know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
“It is a stain on our history and it is a stone on our souls.”
Brooks, 71, is a former member of the Georgian Congress who has spent his entire life fighting for human rights.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to Monroe residents that the injustice has never been corrected.
“We want an investigation, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We can’t move on to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.”
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in the lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always known the two motives of lynchings: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote in the primaries to be held that summer.
Around the same election, the FBI reported that a black whistleblower, Roger Malcolm, stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman, in a fight.
Brooks says that rumors spread in the city that Hester was sleeping with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was about to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of prison and approached Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of lynchers surrounded the car.
“It turns out that he organized and commanded the murders of Harrison,” – this conclusion is made in one of the reports of the FBI.
“It is also clear that there was a collusion between the state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it short.
“It was an attack on voting rights,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a message to the blacks in the city that if you register and vote, the same thing will happen to you.”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has directed an annual performance recounting that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual, it captures the viewer and tells about that deep racism, which, as many would like to believe, is no longer in America.
It’s hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that’s what’s important.
“We don’t want to talk about Lynch courts because they show us our own ugliness,” she says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I’ve been through.”
This year’s rehearsals began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen whites, the rest blacks – gathered indoors and listened to a polished over the years review of the play.
Wade Marbo was the director along with Green.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says that the role has not become easier.
“I think I got dirty because he’s not the person I am,” Marbo says.
“But I think it’s very important to remember that story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
Inside, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Ruscone, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectacle begins when Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, shouts and pushes him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Ruscone shouts back.
It's a blow.
And at the same moment, everyone (at least all black actors) is laughing.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
"What is it?" asks Askona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I overreacting?
"No," Green says through laughter.
"I just don't think white people said 'nigga' then."
“Yes,” laughed one of the black men.
"You have to say a hard 'r'."
And so the energy in the room changes: discomfort is replaced by a sense of companionship.
Everyone must do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the sake of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the word to the letter "n", it turns out clear and sharp.
No one is laughing.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Shouts, screams, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and performs the sad song Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
At a hundred yards from it, fifty spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the show; many live very close by.
They all endured Georgia's heavy spirits for almost eight hours while Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until that moment, murders were only history, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are floating in the air.
When the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children lean over their heads, touch the paint that depicts blood, and still bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly everything is over.
The actors drop the ropes from the neck and wipe the tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main puppet clan.
Nick Ruscona embraces the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the performance finally fell on him.
“It’s okay,” one woman whispered.
“We know you have a good heart.
You had a reason for that.”
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta discusses the performance lively with a black couple they have just met.
Deniza Daplinski struggles to find words to describe how she feels after a performance.
“It’s hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words, and actions... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think lynchings still happen,” she adds, “only now it’s called what the police are shooting.”
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights activist, gained general attention.
He says he has already started planning a show next year.
“The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "Agitation Saturday"
The Simonovsky court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violating the procedure for organizing the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offense provided for in part 8 of Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation "Repeated violation of the procedure for organizing the rally".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court of Moscow Khyzyr Mussakayev finished to consider the administrative case against Leonid Volkov - the head of the headquarters of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In such an amount, Judge Mussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the "Agitation Subbotnik", which Navalny's supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Having seen the agitated materials that followed the participants of the Saturday, the police believed that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for the conduct of which it is necessary to first request permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev petitioned for the termination of administrative proceedings in connection with the absence of the composition of the offense and pointed out that the police made certain mistakes in drawing up the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the very "agitation subbotnik", but he received a summons obliging him to appear at the police station to tell about the event held with his active participation.
The same summonses were received by Navalny himself and another associate of the opposition leader - Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia arrested the shooter of the bride and three guests of the wedding
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people, including a bride, at a wedding.
This was reported to the Republican Department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the quarrel, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event who came to the village pond to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case was initiated under paragraph "a" of part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Hooliganism"), part 3 of Article 30 and paragraphs "a", "e", "and" of part 2 of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Attempt to kill two or more persons, committed in a generally dangerous way, on hooligan's motives").
According to “Interfax”, local media reported that the man opened fire due to the fact that the guests of the wedding, having decided to bathe, passed through the territory of his section to the reservoir.
The Ministry of Energy will tighten the requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When starting gas turbines, hydropower turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government resolution has already been prepared and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect “critical energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
EU extends anti-Russian sanctions over Siemens
The press service of the European Union on August 4 said that anti-Russian sanctions were expanded due to the scandal around the supply of turbines manufactured by Siemens to the Crimea.
This was previously reported by “Arguments of the Week”.
The press service of the Council of the EU said that the sanctions against Russia have been expanded due to the scandal with the turbines manufactured by Siemens, which allegedly were delivered to Crimea in circumvention of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals of member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made before the end of the day, and here is the decision made, the sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson Cuts Another 3,000 Jobs and Cuts Dividends to Bring Business Back to Life
On Friday, Pearson announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 percent as it launched another restructuring program aimed at tackling the challenges facing their businesses.
These job cuts, which CEO John Fallon says will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, come in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third spending cut program to try to revive a business hit by the rapid shift to digital learning methods.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after announcing a 1 percent increase in sales of the core commodity in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were wounded, NATO said.
According to unverified data from local sources, as a result of the incident in the urban area of Karabakh, three civilians were also killed.
The blast is the latest in a bloodbath in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed Tuesday in a blast at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which occurred on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of a “man-portable improvised explosive device”.
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receive treatment at the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
Reporters report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and about 20% of them were in the capital.
In late July, a car bombing killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said the attack was carried out by them.
More than 150 people were killed in a powerful blast in the city centre on May 31, the country’s deadliest terrorist attack since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is assessing the need to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its behavior, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency after lawsuits cancels the decision to postpone the passage of the law on air pollution
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay the passage of an Obama-era law requiring states to limit emissions of air pollutants a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “ozone measurements 2015”, emphasizing that the move shows the agency’s willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our partners in the states,” Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency’s intention to postpone ozone measurements, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine where it needs to be reduced so that it meets stricter air cleanliness standards, by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit claiming the intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed at, according to Trump, shining economic growth.
But action in this direction has sparked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s website says that using ozone-containing air to breathe “could worsen lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
European Business Association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Business expressed its disagreement with the US economic sanctions against Russia.
According to the AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB said in a statement that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade should not be restricted.
The European business unites more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of behavior that would allow to separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to limit the movement on the waterfront in Pskov
The Pskov people’s representatives sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the city Sergei Surin about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Great River.
Deputies of Gorduma Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Pronenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, the control of drivers will help to make this area more calm and safe.
The problem is that intruders ignore the signs of the "Pedestrian path" and freely ride along the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and improvements were carried out in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds due to cars become uncomfortable.
As the Pskov Information Agency notes, in the evening, the central embankment is patrolled by PPS motor patrol officers and escorts.
Thanks to them, the number of cars passing by becomes less, but the traffic does not stop completely.
Putin urges investigators not to remove hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed banning investigative bodies from seizing servers and hard drives from working computers at enterprises.
This was stated by the head of state at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary “to exclude the use in the interests of investigation of measures leading to the suspension of activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers.”
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to remove copies, certify them and use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that "it is impossible to create conditions that prevent the continuation of the enterprise's activities up to the impossibility of paying taxes."

TV presenter Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband - football player Dmitry Tarasov.
At the moment, the celebrity is in the United States, where he deals with work issues.
Just the day before, Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on the social network Instagram.
She said she did not marry, did not have new tattoos, and did not call her ex-husband saying that he ruined her life, although she really wanted to do it.
Buzova said that she will remember this trip forever, because she had great fun.
British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the adaptation of the series of novels about Harry Potter, has died at the age of 92.
This was reported by the newspaper "The Independent" on Thursday.
About the death of the actor told his relatives.
According to them, he has lived "a huge life, achieving success in film, theater and television over 70 years of career".
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he co-starred with Lawrence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus.
Hardy is also remembered for his repeated roles as Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the adaptations of Agatha Christie's works about Miss Marple.
For his performance as Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Motion Picture and Television Arts (BAFTA) award.
Robert Hardy also played the role of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something rotted in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his crowned wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple has a "golden" wedding, but the couple's agenda is not preparations for celebrations, but a grave dispute.
His Majesty renounced the title of Prince Consort, while he slandered the Queen that she never denied him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the Queen's spouse.
Russian Foreign Ministry urges Washington to stop cheating Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement some time ago.
In his commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats urged the US authorities to stop shaming the Russian Federation.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seemingly are moving steadily toward holding the most exciting boxing match to reach 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of ESPN in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization lightweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the former world champion in four weight categories Erien Broner on Saturday on the channel "Showtime", both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a duel with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o’clock in the evening on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko’s manager Egis Klimas noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be just right.
“I used to be half-light,” Garcia recalled.
“I went up in the category for Broner [up to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm not old enough for 140.
I want to go down to the half-lung.
And he has to go up to the half-light [up to 135 pounds], and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let’s make it for them.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast via the PPV service as part of the strategy he follows for Lomachenko to hold his debut fight at 135 later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) for the next summer, who is also interested in fighting the fight easily in the World Cup in September after their fight between Jorge Linares and Lueres 23
“The fight could be on the PPV because all the fans asked for it,” Garcia said, expressing his willingness to fight later on the channel that would offer better financial terms.
“We are the main names.
No other names will arouse such interest.
As soon as they’re ready...”
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "great boxer" and may attend Saturday's fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three scales from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry, Mikey ... you were begging for a knockout".
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the punch and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension growing before their own fight.
“This fight has to happen.
No other fight causes so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”

Putin instructed the Prosecutor General to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to inspect the Baikal Territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to check the Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Putin said at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take action if the facts of violations are revealed.
New test results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method of medical age assessment show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as being over 18 years old, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of the age in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for not being able to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, the Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic medicine agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were rated as people 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensic agency estimated that the subject was “probably a person 18 years or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion stated that the person was “probably under 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is doubtful.
According to Johan Geransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
“We don’t see much difference with the statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite consistent,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were judged to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, "the age of the test subject is likely 18 years or more."
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, the person openly stated that 18 of them were being fulfilled this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves x-raying wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, has also attracted criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I had reasons to think about it, and I don’t think we need to use the measurements that are being used now.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can’t determine it with certainty, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Geransen of the Forensic Medicine Agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, we can say that the risk of mistakenly taking a child for an adult is small.
The biggest risk we face is when a person is soon to be 18, in which case he is about 10 percent.”
I'll think about running for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to consider whether to run for the presidency of Russia in the elections in 2018, reports Interfax.
This statement was a reaction to the request of the residents of the village of Cheremushki, Buryatia region.
During a video conference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election is held, we ask you all to run for this post again."
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions “unfounded, hypothetical reasoning.”
"There are no headquarters yet, far away from the creation of headquarters, far away from the election campaign," Peskov said.
“It’s not on the agenda yet,” Peskov said.
West Virginia Governor Says He's Moving to Another Party
West Virginia Governor and Democratic Party spokesman Jim Justice announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he is moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” Governor Justice said.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections...Today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of any use to you as a Democratic Governor.”
The meeting exploded with applause.
“So tomorrow I’m going to change my registration to a Republican,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you it’s time to play differently.”
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by a margin of 42 percent, and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday evening that “Governor Justice’s move to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is hindering rather than working to make our country great again.”
“Given only 15 governors and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.
Cat-heavy by the name of Mr. Beautiful found a home thanks to social networks
A nursery in Pittsboro (North Carolina, USA) planted a cat named Mr. Handsome weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on the Facebook account of the nursery with a request to find its owner, because “obviously someone fed him before”.
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's muzzle could become a new meme.
The publication garnered more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to shelter Mr. Beautiful.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to deal with his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American woman said that she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users noticed a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The post with a photo of the animal collected more than 68 thousand views.
Commentators noted that she could well make a career in the modeling business.
Coe praised the “sincere” apology of Russia in connection with the doping scandal
International athletics specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sports again.
Russian representative of the athletics federation Dmitry Shlyahtin told the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the world championships in athletics, that the suspension of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he is determined to fight against doping.
He apologised to “all athletes whose gold and silver medals were stolen in the competitions.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the found evidence of state-funded doping.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
“The whole council and the whole congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has been through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Coe said he also “liked” that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that this is not the time to restore Russia to its rights,” Coe said.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the stained system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations Rune Andersen said on Monday that to rebuild Russia has yet to meet a number of requirements.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and suspended coaches are still quietly doing their job.
Court arrests Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), journalist Vasily Muravitsky was sent to arrest for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the Zhytomyr Journal is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy has decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship "Comandante Borsini" entered the territorial waters of Libya, then together with the navy of this country to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was made by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country’s territory.
The opposing cabinet and Tobruk-based Libyan parliament has accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, gave orders to his subordinates to counter the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan cabinet, Faiz Sarraj.
Italian authorities have set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were released in July on the number of illegal migrants arriving in the country from Libya: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the resources for the reception of migrants have been exhausted.

Two leaders of the national team of Ukraine in athletics suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povkh, who specialize in short distance running, have been excluded from the Ukrainian national team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the Executive Committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against athletes by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
Coach Zemlyak Sergey Basenko has also been excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
As reported by Sportarena, the IAAF suspects athletes in the use of doping.
Povkh is a bronze medalist of the Olympics-2012 and the World Championships-2011, the European champion of 2010 in the relay 4 by 100 meters, Zemljak is the winner of the 2012 European Championship in the relay 4 by 400 meters.
The World Championships in Athletics in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the Financial Rules of Football Will Affect Neymar’s Move to Paris
The rules, aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs, will not prevent the world record-breaking transfer of Neymar from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may be further down the chain, UEFA’s Paris Saint-Germain, the governing body overseeing European football, has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to release the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG could certainly go astray to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that got into huge debts in their quest for success, in fact, cheated and risked bankruptcy in the event that banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on club debt and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential, and then spend heavily in order to improve the team and create a global brand – became a difficult plan.
During this exciting 2018 three-year evaluation period, clubs could suffer losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And, despite Platini being stripped of his presidency in 2015 in disgrace, his successor in UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to curb excessive spending.
“Of course, the FFP is alive and we are going to toughen the rules as we move forward,” Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP in UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay the ransom of Neymar's contract in one time, he can allocate this amount for reporting over the entire term of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, heavy sanctions were imposed on PSG as well as on Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (at a rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and was ordered to limit its Champions League squad for the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by inflating their revenues at the expense of companies associated with the club’s owners.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored PSG, if the amount of funding had been deemed to be higher than the standard market rates, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for PSG from the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules even more closely.
As reported on Thursday, people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not have preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros of profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The report for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, sales of attributes and T-shirts with the team logo.
The club expects that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar’s transfer, saying that PSG would disrupt the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of ‘financial doping’, with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that the ultimate owner of PSG is Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga’s doubts about the club’s state funding.
“It’s all the consequences of equity and it’s completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years,” Wenger said.
“When a club belongs to a country, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to observe financial fair play, because a country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the oath shall be determined by the President.
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law were developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Building.
A week ago, deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking an oath in the law.
From the solemn oath will be released children under 18 years of age, as well as incapacitated, follows from the amended text of amendments to the bill "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (at the disposal of "Izvestia"), which the Committee will consider before the second reading on July 11 at its meeting.
The idea of introducing an oath when entering the Russian Federation instead of formally signing documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on June 6 during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
Deputies formalized this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, providing for the cancellation of the decision on the granting of citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, its logic was as follows: when issuing citizenship documents, a person signs under the promise to comply with Russian legislation - taking the path of extremism, he breaks this promise.
The draft law was submitted to the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Fair Russia") and Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been reworked again.
Now it says that the procedure for taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where the coat of arms of the Russian Federation can be placed is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of bodies of state power of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could also be logs.
Those wishing to obtain Russian citizenship will take a solemn oath after officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport a person will receive only after he takes the oath, follows from the amended text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will swear by 18 years, and not by 14.
The rule has been retained, according to which incapacitated or limited incapacitated persons will be exempted from taking the oath, as well as those who are unable to pronounce, read or sign the oath text by themselves.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt "other persons" from this procedure.
Also, the updated draft law stipulates a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of residents of Ukraine who are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship, submitting an appropriate application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
Renunciation of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for in an international treaty or if it is impossible “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first Deputy Speaker of the General Directorate Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, simply impossible.
Accordingly, many people are waiting for the decision of their fate on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - said the head of the Duma Committee on state building and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (EP).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have written to renounce “other” citizenship and handed over the previous passport in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but “for reasons beyond his control” he has not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Currently, foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be hired for objects and organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country may not become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of the story nostalgically recalls at the same time the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; the era of grunge in the 90s (about the time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter made a comedy sketch "State" for MTV); and about herself - that is, Radley's more about 2001, before her stars, Poe and Bix as Elizabeth.
As a fact of culture, it is both the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems like an anachronism.
The first day of the camp was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurd humor (including the original story of a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually anxious children who have just reached adulthood; thanks to this, the inability to return to becomes part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," where adults played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystematic and includes riffs from stalker films of the 90s like "Hands Shaking the Cradle."
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other 1991 stuff."
Many of the plot moves are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still hasn’t achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet parted with his virginity.
And then there is the insane and vile conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (also Showalter) is involved, who is now incited by George Bush Sr. (a tried and tested parody performed by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the deviations from it.
Especially funny to see the eternally young Rudd, who sings a song of Matt Dillon from "The Lonely Ones", whose character, the former big man Andy, now looks old.
This franchise could be a success in the spirit of random madness in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up", until it reaches what, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last scene the whole company would go to the movies for the premiere of the film "Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: the memories of the Cold War from "Americans", "Bloody Blonde" or even "Gloss" with her images of the struggle between East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, portrays a telefilm: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - the life-saw Gregor and idealist Joseph - performed by Florin Piercic Jr. and Corneliu Ulich, and voiced their dialogues in English by Channing Tatum (aka executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police spend time watching a chess match as Americans might watch football).
The team of famous behind-the-scenes voices - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows an interesting game of "guess the voice".
But Comrade Detective clings so much to the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama — there’s even a killer in a Ronald Reagan mask — that it often looks like.
Six long episodes are long, and funny is not very and not often.
Had it been shortened, Comrade Detective could have handled his satire better in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, two fat men sit in the lobby, swallowing up a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist viewer, this image tells that Western culture is capable of turning anything into a gluttony.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do this even with our own recent history, and with theirs too.
The prize fund of the match for the Super Cup of Russia in football between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Pryadkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that so far there are almost no tickets for the match.
The match "Spartak" - "Locomotive" will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As noted by TASS, "Spartak" - the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Locomotive" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufa cleaned a furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufa man with a furniture company turned to the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The tools for the mining of thieves were a total cost of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulic, a winch.
The security guards began to search for the criminals and soon went out to the residents of the Annunciation district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic, accomplices penetrated the territory of the enterprise, broke into the front door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service.
They have already been charged with theft, and law enforcement has managed to return only part of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
State Department commented on Medvedev's words about relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev on the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to hopes for improving bilateral relations and declared Russia a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert admitted that Russian-American relations are at a “low level”, but noted that it is necessary to look for “areas for interaction”.
"Look at the ceasefire in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," the diplomat told RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian prime minister that the sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
However, he acknowledged that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the U.S. Constitution.
Dior "grown" roses from amethyst and quartz
The jewellery division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has replenished the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They had five new rings and three choker necklaces on velvet ribbons.
In the line of Rose Dior Pré Catelan released two new rings and a pendant made of amethyst, rose quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of glyptic (hand carving on stone) and pavement and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses grown at his estate in Granville by fashion designer Christian Dior, and the Parisian gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catellan.
Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to the deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
“Thank Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” he tweeted.
On the eve of Donald trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a statement by the president in which he indicated that the law would not allow the United States to make profitable deals and would bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Entrepreneur from Belarus Viktor Prokopenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention to “focus on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be "the best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of the daughter of Sberbank.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of a unit of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU in July rejected the application of the consortium of NorvikBank Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko in March imposed sanctions against their subsidiaries.
One of these financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - was Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of the blackout in the Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation called the cause of the blackout in the Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, clarified the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck involved in the accident hit the power lines, as a result of which the Kuban and related Crimean networks were disconnected.
Power outages in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Experts solved the problems within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could be an abnormal heat.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and declining inflation have stifled rumours of a possible rise.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain slow and left interest rates unchanged amid rising pressure on family incomes.
The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) experts voted 6 to 2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month in favour of raising the rate because weak economic growth weakened support for the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that pressure on family incomes will continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs would likely have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Also, the committee members voted to abandon part of the huge set of measures to develop the economy, launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close an emergency financing plan under which it provides cheap loans to banks, although it said it would now have to provide another <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion - up to <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion - under the plan.
In a statement, the bank said: “According to the MPC’s main forecasts, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will remain slow in the near future, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to halt inflation, it would require “some tightening of financial policy”, in “a little more” than markets expect.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases will be “gradual” and “limited”.
The bank’s forecasts for an increase this year and next are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank has left its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth rates weakened an increased expectation of an increase; GDP then rose 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, it seems, will remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households, which were hit by high inflation and very small wage increases: according to the bank, pressure will intensify before falling.
The bank added that financial policy “cannot prevent” the success of earnings in the next few years, but expects that wages will “significantly” recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also attuned to growth as a result of rising demand for British goods, driven by the pound’s low exchange rate, which offsets some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shocking results of a referendum on leaving the European Union, which led to the fall of the pound.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision on rates, there was an uproar over the proposed rate hikes, as inflation was putting more pressure on already-severely-pressured households: three members of the committee asked for a rate hike to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, though the bank said the decline was expected and will be offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher figure compared to the planned 2% is entirely due to the low exchange rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market seems to be getting even more competitive again as lenders demand business opportunities and look forward to a good end to the year.
The market looks particularly favorable for those who are nearing the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as at a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.
The state health service will prescribe a controversial drug for HIV 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after a battle in the High Court over funding from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a pre-sex pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service for an initial three-year trial period of about 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court backed a High Court ruling last year that claimed the National Health Service had the ability to pay for the PrEP despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was called the “most important innovation” by the president of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a “turning point.”
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venereology dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PRP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and persons whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is being restrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereology dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10m, and England’s National Health Service this week, following an international procurement tender, signed a drug supply contract.
The study is structured in such a way as to assess all the possibilities of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its assimilability and use on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and reinforce the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in tackling one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at people in need and at risk, is an opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV will have access to a new, new tool that they can control without discussing it with their partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing we need to do now is to make sure that the test is rolled out quickly across the country and that no one in the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we have the experimental PrEP, we are moving forward to protect the more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow minister of public health, said: “We very much welcome the start of the PrEP trial, it is very late due to months of delays and delays from the government.”
The data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the test is deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk for HIV and to push us one step further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on the support of the treaty between Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively proven form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people".
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole.”
Since July 24, 2007, the agreement between Moscow and Kazan has been signed for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and retain the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "President".
In Russia, there are difficulties in obtaining international driving licenses
Divisions of traffic police have a shortage of international driving licenses (IDLs).
To get such rights, you have to wait a few weeks in line, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go abroad on vacation in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licenses remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized and so on.
However, in reality, it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require ICU, and someone enough national rights.
To insure, drivers still receive international rights, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the Convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all departments of traffic police, Kommersant reports, having conducted a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, in the units of UGIBDD, coupons are simply not issued, forms have been missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the website of state services, but the queue has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get the Interior Ministry "for technical reasons", without going into details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, such messages are increasingly appearing in social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the police departments ran out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question to knowledgeable people!"
We need to get international rights urgently.
In Moscow, all the time is hammered far ahead, on the spot, coupons are not issued at all (there is a button, but the coupon can not be given).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in St. Petersburg free time to hell.
Has anyone tried it in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving licenses have changed, so new forms are delivered to the departments of the State Automobile Inspection.
This may be associated with a deficit, however, it is unclear what changes we are talking about, this was not previously reported.
The forms are purchased by the Special Purpose Center in the field of road safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplied to traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with JSC "Goznak": in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 forms of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were produced, in 2016 15,000 forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90,000, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with LLC "First Printed Yard" for the production of 70,000 forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold the tender, which is why there was a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, it is unclear, so people are reinsured, and therefore there was an excitement demand for international "crusts".
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The International Driving Permit (IDP) of the new model is valid from May 31, 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko said that he does not believe in the ability of Russia to build a bridge into the Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the portal "Observer".
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or nut there, because it risks losing its business on the territory of the EU, the United States, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia regarding Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects of this project actually do not exist," Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build even smaller-scale facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, whole stadiums have already begun to collapse.
“Therefore, I believe that the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that are short-sighted enough to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, builders completed the construction of the car arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the shore of Kerch completed enlargement of the road arch of the Crimean bridge: its vault is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, bridge builders have prepared a railway arch for installation on the waterway supports," the project's information center said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of transport Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
In Spain, fired an official who did not go to work for 10 years
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) did the chief of the Spanish official, Carlos Recio, have to possess?
The permanent walk stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was dismissed.
But not your immediate boss.
What happens in the world of bureaucrats?
The commoners seem to have long been accustomed to all the pranks of the “servants of the people”.
And yet, officials always manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, the “sensation” came from Spain.
There, the Valencian archives officer Carles Recio managed to not go to work for ten years.
He regularly received a salary.
And all solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
Mr. Rezio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was fired by the Valencian Legislature.
During the investigation, it turned out that an angry walker came to the office every morning at 07:00 to register in the electronic system.
And I was going home right away.
Once again, he appeared at the workplace at 4:00 p.m. to again note in the system that he had left.
It's been 10 years.
It also became known that the walker devoted all his free time to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Valencian Legislative Assembly are thinking how to punish the immediate boss of Mr. Recio, who could not help but know how to "actively work" at his workplace his subordinate.
Judges to be protected from presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The Human Rights Council proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and to introduce their electiveness.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The Human Rights Council has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian judiciary.
This work was carried out by the Human Rights Council on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the members of the Council.
At the meeting with the members of the council on December 8, 2016, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness were discussed, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see Kommersant from December 9, 2016).
The work of the Human Rights Council resulted in 25 proposals, which concern both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin’s human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts in order to increase the independence of other judges.
If a candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the competition and has received the support of the judicial community, the President of the court, in the opinion of the Human Rights Council, must present him for appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to distribute cases among the judges.
To do this, experts admit, may be a specially written computer program.
Also, the HRC believes that the chairman has no right to "predetermine the results of the qualification attestation of the judge, initiate his bringing to disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the "election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "to give them powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Now all presidents of courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the Human Rights Council proposes to reorganize the appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Human Rights Council says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
There are "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials who find it difficult to use the "telephone right".
The Human Rights Council proposes to strengthen the judges of the people in order to consider some “categories of civil and administrative cases” with their participation.
For example, on deprivation of parental rights, on restoration at work, on protection of honor and dignity, on deprivation of driver's license, etc.
"These are just our proposals," explained the member of the Human Rights Council, retired judge of the Constitutional Court Tamara Morshchakova.
She also recalled that the president’s instructions were not only for the Human Rights Council, but also for the Supreme Court, which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the execution of the assignment by the Armed Forces (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Ombudsman for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev must by September 1.
Living a High Life: Half-floor and cunning design techniques have turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the ground floor of a cute Queen Anne-style model house, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not pack her things and did not move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area,” Joan says.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day.”
Since the first view, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Initially, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to squeeze the maximum benefit from the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she says.
For this purpose, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill’s Duck & Shed architectural and design studio to use 12.5-foot-high ceilings to create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but fit Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-floor where one could stand in full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were above each other, and did not have to bend.
It was necessary not only to build a simple platform, but also to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the rooms from above and from below.
This solution allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one above the other in a dedicated space – and much more interesting.
From the half-floor through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" offers a view of the chic living room below.
Mirror furniture with gold finishes, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serge Mui set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored protective panel looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a feeling of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can enclose the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding up door, like in a garage.
"Engineering art was involved here," Erfan tells about the steel-reinforced wood-fiber shield door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“After all, the floor area is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your property is valued for,” Erfan says.
“Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the floor area.”
Here they were able to increase the area of the floors, using quality materials that give the space a shade of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional bond with the home,” Erfan says.
“No one falls in love with wiring in walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t touch the strings of our hearts.”
This is evidence that due to good design and increased footage, an apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can choose to stay.
Government Approves Establishment of Cultural Policy Commission
The Russian government has approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant decree is published on the government's website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft strategies for cultural policy, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
The head of the commission appointed Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
In 2016, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved a plan for the implementation of the strategy of the state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in the G20 fell to an eight-year low
Consumer price growth in the G20 countries has fallen to its lowest level in eight years, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 amounted to 2% - lower values were noted in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal deforestation of Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal deforestation during a meeting on environmental development of the natural Baikal Territory.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
It allows deforestation during firefighting, and the government plans to adopt it as early as autumn.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting "everything is not cut off in a row."
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: the fighters of the APU secretly from the command agree with the militias of the Donbass
On the line of armed confrontation in the Donbass established regular telephone communication.
Fighters of the opposing sides are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known at headquarters.
The fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the militias of Donbas have established communication by cell phones in secret from their high command.
This is reported on August 4, "Strana.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not at all domestic: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactical agreements”.
Often, as a result of such talks, a truce is concluded at a certain section of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when congratulations on the birthday of an officer received from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
Fighters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and militias of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
The Foreign Ministry was outraged by the blocking of statements of the UN Security Council about attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian embassy in Damascus on August 2, for the third time in a month, was subjected to mortar shelling by terrorist groups Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in Russia) and Faylaq al-Rahman.
Taking into account that the international community unanimously qualifies “Nusra” as a terrorist organization, and resolutions of the UN Security Council call to counter this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that “it would seem, it goes without saying that the terrorist attacks of “Nusra” must meet universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and in the assessment of raids against diplomatic missions should not be twofold”.
However, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, hiding arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement of the Security Council for the press with condemnation of terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic.
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of these delegations.
“The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to further provocations and attacks, makes them feel impunity,” the Foreign Ministry said, adding that “these barbarians would not want to be made to believe that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin called for limiting the number of unscheduled business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number planned, and also said about the need to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
"Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% are coordinated with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," the president said.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to prohibit investigators from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should be given the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive in the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
According to Kommersant, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, at the request of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it was found that in fact there was a replacement of planned inspections by unscheduled (the share of those encountered increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutorial (from 16.9% to 21.8%), administrative investigations (from 7.9% to 13.3%), and citizens’ inspections (from 7.9% to 13.3%).
More about business inspections in the material "Kommersant" "Small business came from the other side".
The brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth more than $ 500 million
Two brothers fight for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million – forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin de Lutis lives in Turac Palace three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court over the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to quit the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still arguing over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of De Lutis family properties today includes office buildings, development sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best pieces of property,” he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings in the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some facilities.
In testimony given by Colin at the start of the trial, he says he hopes the dispute will be resolved.
“My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority,” he wrote.
Trial costs are rising like a snowball: hundreds of pages of depositions, emails, and reports from companies like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer are attached to the case; both sides have attracted some of the best-known lawyers, including the royal attorney Allan Myers, and the best shredders.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and gourmets, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grades of school and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old) at the time."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luigi often told me he didn’t want the brothers to go to court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colin says Mark received $10 million when he left the business, and Luke received $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unhappy with the financial conditions of their department".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL club's board of directors and, according to Eddie McGuire's 2015 biography, the star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin responded by texting, saying that since the case had not yet been tried in court, “I really have nothing to say.”
“I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and shout out the name of our family in court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not like to see Paul and I arguing in court,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution to the conflict.”
On Friday, that hope seems to have dissipated.
"Our case will soon be decided by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trump administration plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in the hope of keeping the chief in a more calm state.
This is what reporter Josh Dawes reports.
“At a meeting hosted by the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly with the administration on his first working day, he outlined a major issue in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes will be resolved: poor channels of information to the President.”
Kelly told employees that information should pass through him — in paper form or through briefings — because the president would be better at making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is absolutely correct, but others have already failed in trying to subdue Trump by tracking the flow of information to him.
President Trump’s relationship with television developed decades ago – and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to show him that he was getting fair coverage in newspapers that could be re-convinced,” Sam Nanberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in Politico that “according to six former campaigners, in order to control Trump’s habit of tweeting, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information coming to him personally.”
Okay. Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s habit of tweeting was ever “under control” is simply ridiculous.
Perhaps these election campaign members know something we don’t know – for example, that without them, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump didn’t post.
If his employees saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from pouring oil on the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trump with material—reliable or not—that confirms their views.
Politico wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly give dubious information to the president.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Trump’s current and former employees say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone submitted to the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, in which deputy head of the office Katie Welsh was accused of being "behind a number of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn’t matter if Johnson is banned forever on Twitter for aggressive behavior, if he hasn’t presented specific facts, or if in the past he has launched false accusations and then dropped them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Welsh.”
Goldmacher adds that the then head of the cabinet, Reines Priebus, and the secretary of the cabinet, Rob Porter, were “trying to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them.”
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor’s office fights HIV dissident
The prosecutor’s office challenged the decision of the Kalininsky district court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident whose young daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with reconciliation with the victim's father.
The prosecution believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished, so as not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (cause of death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection in stage 4.
According to prosecutors, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV does not exist," the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region said.
The criminal case was filed in the Kalininsky district court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "he forgave his wife, she has no complaints to her, she atone for the damage and apologized."
The Prosecutor ' s Office disagreed with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to dismiss the case be overturned and sent for a new hearing.
The girl has died, and it is impossible to compensate for the damage caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection," the press service of the prosecutor's office said.
According to the supervisory authority, she should be punished, otherwise her example will be followed by other HIV dissidents.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care because of the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already improved - for a year of work of a special group, half of parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to conduct a diagnosis, began to take drugs," - said the press secretary of the Center for AIDS Elena Loseva.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
The Dangers of HIV Dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement in Russia.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their dissemination see a serious threat.
A terrible photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the railway station Grechany in Khmelnitsky.
A cheerful company of drunken young people was walking on a bridge over the railway tracks, where just stood a freight train.
One of the friends had the idea to take a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, told "FACTS" in the police communication sector in the Khmelnitsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but due to his carelessness, he clung to the power line and instantly received an electric shock.
Fortunately, the case became known to the station's dispatcher, who immediately called an "emergency".
Before the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn ward of the Khmelnitsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns torso 1-2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcers remind that in recent years, extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, and moving vehicles have become increasingly popular.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and not allow such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
There may have been oceans on ancient Venus.
This was suggested by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that Venus at the beginning of its history formed oceans, which had 10% more water than now on Earth.
Previously, “Arguments of the Week” wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could have existed on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their studies came to the conclusion that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
As a result of shooting in a park in San Francisco, three people were injured.
In San Francisco, as a result of the shooting wounded three people, reports Associated Press.

Another was given medical care, after which he was released.
The third victim is a minor and there are no details about his condition.
Located on the hill Dolores Park is a popular destination among locals and tourists.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured while attempting to leave the building.

"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album of the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous anti-utopia novel by O. Huxley "O wonderful new world".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell about a society that lives by the law of dystopia, “blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values.”
To raise money for the recording of the album, the group was helped by listeners: on the website "Planeta.ru" the project was supported by more than 1200 people.
Louna released her first album "Make Louder!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013 recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the band Louna performed with the symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the program "Songs of Peace".
In the group Lusine Gevorkyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkratyev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will be held at the Barnaul club "Pharaoh" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands in the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "Devil's Dozen".
The gypsies crossed the trench and returned to the “street of millionaires”
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again in conflict with the determined Gypsies, who have crossed a moat dug by municipal authorities to retake the field near their homes.
Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla street, which received the joking name of “the street of millionaires”.
Having brought with them horses, infants and many houses on wheels, they returned after being expelled no further than in May, and were not prevented by a moat dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defensive structures and squeezed its vehicles through a section that was left unprotected to leave room for the trail.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying it was "unable to solve this problem".
An anonymous resident said: “They arrived here on Monday evening after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they were throwing stones at passers-by.”
The municipality should be embarrassed and forced to act, because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were expelled, and here they are again.
More gypsies came last night, and maybe more today.
"The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don’t like the fact that I keep paying the municipal tax and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw these Gypsies leave the last time, and here, please, this attack continues."
This time there were more, and we even saw a horse grazing in the meadow.”
A spokesman for the Solihull municipality said: “We are aware of an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with the Solihull police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them out as soon as possible.”
To help us gather evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police on the phone 101.
This allows us to get an idea of the situation, which will be considered by the court when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the champagne wine factory "New World"
The State Enterprise of the Republic of Crimea "Plant of Champagne Wines "New World" decided to operate, transforming into JSC "Plant of Champagne Wines "New World", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of the Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the shares of the company will remain in the state ownership of the Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will be 595.5 million rubles. and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles. each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if within the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the enterprise, then there will be a threat of stopping the plant.
Wear of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget revenue.
What remains is insufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"It is problematic to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about attracting borrowed funds from large credit organizations," Deputy Head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea Sergey Petelin said in April this year.
The Parliament of Crimea included the company in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to hold its shares and put them up for auction.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of the Crimea estimated the possible cost of the sale of the company in $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $30 million.
New World in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New World intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the New World estate he purchased.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third graders destroyed more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identities of citizens who destroyed 46 tombstones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the grave slabs were damaged by unknown people was received by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs on the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
A total of 24 people turned to the police on this occasion.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or profanation of burial sites".
As a result of the investigation, the police identified suspects, they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested to see the monuments fall, and this prompted them to act hooliganically.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone against NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If the NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin-based daily Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had only worked for a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving human lives is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone,” the organization said in a statement.
“We will only be able to assess all the accusations made now after we have gathered all the information and we can assess the situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventus vessel, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of taking migrants on board with whole lifeboats, which human traffickers sent directly to them, and allowing smugglers to leave along with boats that they could reuse.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecution’s materials, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the zone, rather for humanitarian reasons than for any other motives.
The Code of Conduct mainly assumes that the Juventus-class vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided they did not entail any “significant changes or impediments” to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He outlined plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we don’t want to associate with either side of the conflict.”
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have become more frequent.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Dengov told Kommersant what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and who it is betting on.
Almost nothing is known about the Libya Contact Group that you head.
Here, say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was created at the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya. - "Kommersant").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker Mechanic Chebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board.
We thought about how we could help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you come to be the one to lead it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activity was not limited to the release of the sailors from the Mechanics of Chebotarev.
We have managed to establish contacts with representatives of all major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Sarraj is based) and Tobruk (the seat of the parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar), which controls the eastern regions.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Libya's deputy prime minister - Kommersant), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate ourselves with either side of the conflict, we have a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are five people in the contact group.
Among them are people with experience working in security structures, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to include representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the group of specialists for the region.
No one of our staff is permanently in Libya, this is not yet necessary.
Are there Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya now?
If so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the talk and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group includes ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to us until a certain point, such as Misrata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in subsequent years.
We arrived in Misrata in January of this year.
We were terrified, they said that they were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the real role of the Islamists there.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the banned in Russia "Islamic State" - "Kommersant").
We wanted to look at them, to get to know these people, to check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed this credit to himself.
So what's your conclusion?
Has the Islamic State defeated Haftar in Libya?
That's not what he did.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And ISIS in Sirte was fought by structures subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited to Russia the people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation.
And they came - the visit lasted from April 19 to 23 this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and the Rosgvardia.
You, as we understand, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or, again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, the agreements will be broken, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
A good signal for us was the fact that Sarraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders have spoken extremely negatively about each other.
As for Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We encountered this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But Misrata didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people to come to us today."
But our task is precisely to show that we do not only support Haftar, we have a dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were in touch.
Does the fact that he studied in the USSR twice facilitate mutual understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
Russian, if he knows it, is very relative.
But the fact that he learned from us, of course, facilitates the dialogue with him.
And not just with him, by the way.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian very well.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent nostalgic for it.
Do you believe that the arms embargo against Libya is likely to be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in delivering Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not like to arm some at the expense of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to somehow contribute to its lifting.
The process of drafting a constitution in Libya is now being actively promoted.
We hope that the parties will reach compromises and reach an internal consensus.
Then the elections must take place, which was also discussed at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections take place and the legitimate government is finally elected (and now neither party has such a status), then the question of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the UN Security Council.
To raise this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation, using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar’s detachments take control of the coast and end the business of smuggling immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia’s support because Moscow is in dialogue with Haftar, Sarajev, Misrata and the south at the same time.
And in this matter, the tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the southerners stopping the flow of migrants on long-distance approaches?
That is, conditionally speaking, turned back the buses in which Nigerian migrants travel?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help unite the South in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the South.
But first, we would like to see the unity of opinion between Haftar and Saraj on this issue.
The head of government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of sharia norms in the country.
How radical are his views?
Will this not be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
Islamists are in the coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country – moderately Islamic, open to the world.
They are also actively fighting terrorists.
Why does he have such a reputation?
It is created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where the legislative, executive and judicial powers are located.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed all the cards and began to actively communicate with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft head Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago there was the first shipment of Libyan oil from Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess reselling.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
Plans to re-sign contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
We are talking, in particular, about the previous agreements in the field of transport (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, we are talking about the “oil in exchange for services” scheme?
I do not know what the scheme will be, I do not deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans come to terms with each other so that they can restore order and Libya ceases to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and squeeze the terrorists out of there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date, not a single person from Russia and other countries of the former USSR is there.
He said that he has about 50,000 phone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Kommersant") and the Russian speech does not sound there.
Which countries are these militants from?
I wouldn't want to go into those details.
Let’s formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamic militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, not more than 5%.
The rest are outcasts.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks like Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several visits are yet to take place, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
In the Chekhov museum, philanthropists collected money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the Moscow Museum-Reserve "Melikhovo" nine-year-old boy Sasha Mazola, who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephaly of the brain and complete blindness, August 5 will receive a specialised treadmill.
The useful presentation will be presented to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosareva and the Director of the Museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Do not get tired of doing good", which took place in Melikhov on July 15 on Chekhov Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon at the museum, Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino, Chekhov district, received a letter: "My eyes are not visible at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
“I would really like to get a treadmill as a gift so that my legs become strong and I could learn to walk a little bit.”
And now Sasha's dream has come true!
After the presentation in the museum-reserve will be held "Concert-postscriptum" - a famous pianist, honored artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform a popurry of popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Voznesenskaya Davydova Desert, the bell towers of the workshop of Ilya Drozdikhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnesin, artists of the Melikhov Theater "Chekhov Studio".
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with the marathon logo were organized.
The Museum-Reserve "Melikhovo" took the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov July 15 a single day of charity in all museums in the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zhytomyr region, near a local football stadium shot several times at teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, told "FACTS" in the communication department of the police of the Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a cafe nearby.
In the building he had a conflict, during which the man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim received the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the gunman had fled by that time.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullet-shooting device seized that's been sent for examination.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya street on the night of July 28 there was an attack with shooting.
Michelle Carter sentenced for messages that led to Conrad Roy's suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for inciting her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to commit suicide by text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months in prison and another five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain at large pending the appeal.
She was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy both suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, shrugging her hands and lowering her eyes.
"She killed Conrad Roy with her actions," the prosecutor told the court.
She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not accept responsibility,” she said.
“She didn’t show any remorse.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “tragic case that she deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said in his opinion that her “age, level of maturity or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions.”
The prosecutor read out a statement from Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, which said: “Not a single day has passed since I mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I’m handling it – I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will remain with us forever.”
Roya’s sister, Camden Roy, said she was haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
“To lose the person who has been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that provides responsibility for counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
“You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself, I don’t know many ways,” she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, while he was resting with his family.
Minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the ignition and you will be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and forbade her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
Lawyers’ opinions on this are divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison.”
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a bird of high flight"
One of the best basketball players of the United League VTB 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender “Izvestia” commented on the President of UNIX Evgeny Bogachev.
The whale made this decision for family reasons, - said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played in UNIX three seasons and in each match showed a high level, gave 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played at the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the United League-2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award for the most successful player of the Euroleague season.
He scored an average of 21.75 points per game.
This is the second time since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of the Euroleague to receive this award more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese “Shenzhen”, reports Eurohoops.
The American is expected to enter into a 2-year contract worth $ 5 million.
Langford will be the second star of the Euroleague after July, which is moving to the Chinese championship.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA moved ex-center "Panatinaikos" Yannis Burusis.
Burned in the sun tourist from Moscow evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adygean rescuers today helicopter evacuated from the mountainous region of the republic suburban tourist, who received severe sunburns.
The man rested in the shelter "Fisht", located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers turned to the head of the tour group, who said that the burns the man received in the campaign.
Audi will have to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 cars.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes “there are more intelligent roads than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is based – that were considering banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to contribute to compliance with carbon emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers of installing diesel vehicle exhaust gas neutralizing equipment is also rising, and maintaining a competitive car price is becoming difficult.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of indulging influential automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of “Volkswagen”, which concealed the use of the so-called “disaster devices”, which during testing could modify the amount of harmful gases emitted, so that it complies with the rules, and in normal driving conditions turned off.
In the United States, several Volkswagen executives have been convicted, while others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department of the Audi engine development team was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacqueo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s revenue.
In Astrakhan, a visitor to a cafe paid with fake money
The police received a message from the employee of the branch of the bank about the discovery in the recalculation of funds received from the point of catering, suspicious banknotes with a denomination of 5 thousand rubles.
A study conducted at the Forensic Expert Center showed that it is a fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors of the cafe who bought the shawarma.
It is worth noting that the cashier was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of bills.
Currently, the police are identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a forged ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful when making financial transactions; employees of trading facilities are recommended to install devices to verify the authenticity of the received funds.
Astronomers have found a "hell" planet on which even iron can melt
After first studying the stratosphere properties of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts noted that the water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature makes the water in the atmosphere of the planet glow in the infrared.
WASP-121b belongs to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located tens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, a year on an exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become worse to grow due to arid weather and disease-carrying insects; this has caused a constant headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chess, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is really under threat because in recent years this plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the autumn, the rainfall has become much less.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
And there are small cicadas, leaping on the leaves of insects, carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, they become very many.
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is in high demand in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Schess says: "Instead of very long spikes with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent at all.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oil.”
Solutions now under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties that are more drought-resistant.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with novice hockey players and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 as part of the thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on the artificial ice field.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games with a raffle of souvenir products of student games, warm-up from the aerobics federation were organized.
Fifty students participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to engage as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to engage in hockey.
“It is great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019, where beginner athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams,” the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The Universiade tent will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Winter Universiade-2019 Directorate reports.
In the State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, commenting at a briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said the need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to “improve bilateral cooperation”.
An example of such successful cooperation, Nauert called the agreement on Syria on the ceasefire.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other,” she said.
At the same time, Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev’s statement about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia said that, then of course it has the right to speak, but I can’t say anything more on this topic,” the spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill on tightening sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington had declared a full-fledged trade war against Moscow, putting an end to hopes for improved bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that U.S. sanctions will last for decades.
In addition, according to the Prime Minister, the American establishment “purely beat” Trump.
Missing in the Moscow region bodybuilder found in a foreign country lost memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he left the cabin of the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and local residents.
And Shamil found himself in someone else's cottage in Ramensky.
He was found naked in his bathroom.
The Dagestani athlete could not explain how he ended up here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
Announcements of his disappearance helped to establish his identity.
Arriving by the call, the doctors recorded Khanmetov's partial memory loss and traumatic brain injury, the public Mash.
There are other surprises awaiting the athlete.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil probably already visited his apartment, the keys of which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the received oil and gas revenues at the end of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as the agency explains, occurred mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June, used for the assessment, as well as due to exceeding the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products projected levels.
"The deviation of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019 in August 2017 is projected to be +40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said.
Thus, the total amount of funds directed to the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will amount to the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency on organized trades of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underscores that in Mexico it is becoming more and more dangerous.
Employees of the weekly Riose newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about safety.
They were told to change their habits.
The two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children to an office they had already been grenade-thrown in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column – no evidence is needed, suspicions and inner feelings will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or the cartels, a whole list of scoundrels who make the work of covering the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence is rampant, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that multiply in the country: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, no less than 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer, co-founder of "Ryodose" Javier Valdés Cárdenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdés wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence is ubiquitous - a large photo of Valdés showing his middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the building "Riodose"; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that depict his company, his smile, his face in the olchka.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, so far only two cases have been investigated, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As is the case with most of the thousands of murders committed each year in connection with drug trafficking and organized crime, murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Rios journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although around now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, there is little use," Ibarra says.
“It’s silly to waste time in this seminar,” he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of "Ryodose" in the capital of the state of Culiacan.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually spread quickly in Kuliakan.
But about Valdez almost everyone is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the U.S. in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
Let’s not say that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story drug king mausoleums, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Forget for a moment that the state of “calmness” is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the seaside state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old co-founder and director of "Ryodose", is crushed by a sense of guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview with Damaso López, the leader of one of the cartel’s rival factions, which is at war with Guzmán’s sons, was published in February.
The publication could have angered the sons; people who were supposedly gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that was writing about the same story was seized.
Valdés was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his assassination was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and in 2003 he and five colleagues founded Rios, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without talking about drugs," Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this edition they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Rios received the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for reporter work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating drug trafficking to Mexico, wherever it led.
He admitted frankly that he was scared.
“I want to move on,” he said at the CPJ awards ceremony.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” he said in October last year in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to accept the tasks that lie ahead of you as a journalist—either that or you’re just fooling around.”
I don’t want to be asked, “What were you doing when there were so many deaths around... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?”
The employees of "Riodos" miss Valdez, a joker who swears like a loader in the port, a friend, generous to hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to get around alive.
They trusted in the order in which they were placed.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: was he destroyed by the love of the once-established order?
His death also caused them to doubt their calculations on how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you know about their wives, their children, their legal business, and their clandestine narcotics airfields.
"These things were beyond the line," Bohorkes said.
The result, even in better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from things that smell bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riose, Andrés Villarreal, is that “the sense of smell can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier happens.”
The old rules, he says, and others, no longer apply in Sinaloa — as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the employees of “Riodos” gathered for security training, suddenly it turned out to be forbidden to bring cell phones: a few days earlier it became known that spy programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, are used in Mexico to spy on journalists and public activists.
Outside, two policemen are sheltered in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were tasked by the state government to guard the office of Ryodos, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacan.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked if these policemen were among the 50 percent of law enforcement officers the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the next issue, "Ryodos" counted on three main topics.
This is the Sinaloa murder of the brother of former boxing champion Julio César Chávez.
They also had to expose government spending concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the D.A.'s office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, several governors from PRI have been exposed to high-profile corruption accusations.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzmán’s son El Chapo escaped a military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdez’s column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
“In the past, we would have known what had happened,” said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed “El Flaco” for his skinny physique.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been cut off."
Valdez’s office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor’s office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
The body was found burned, and authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to gain international support in demanding justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to be given any more assignments to cover government activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, its accomplices in the government and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just being killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they are being killed by politicians and security services conspiring with organized crime.
The Committee to Protect the Press, Article 19, estimates that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by order of the police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,” Ramirez says.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note allegedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel was found on her body: “I’m here because of my articles.”
The computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some newspapers chose to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after her correspondent Miroslava Brich was murdered in March.
Others continue to hold on like the “El Manyana” of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page editorial entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have left their home states or the country at all.
This is a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they are still looking for danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to photographer Rubén Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work balance daily between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he is afraid to write about the drug trade.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready to be printed, the publishers of “Riodos” were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office drinking beer, when suddenly their phones rang simultaneously.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masatlan left behind, according to confirmed reports, 19 bodies.
The war continued as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the website of “Riodos”.
The next day I had to rewrite the first page.
There were sirens nearby - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked to see if the police guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of "Riodos" continued his work.
"How can you think about closing," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her out on the street to do a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit terrifying.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhino, discovered by a Canadian miner, preserved so well that experts called it "the Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown – and to say that he had, in a way, a “dark past.”
The report, published in the journal Modern Biology, described it as "the best-preserved of the Tyreophores in the history of the finds and one of the best specimens of a dinosaur in the world."
This fossil is a recently found specimen of a nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible good condition has stunned researchers who call it “really remarkable.”
This herbivorous thyrophorus is the best-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the finds, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
It was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Sancor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from the surrounding breed, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was carried out to find an animal inside a 2,500-foot (1,100 kilograms)-massed earth block.
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"It only takes a little squint, and you can almost believe that he is asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, where the creation is shown.
“It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved specimens of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
By studying its skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite being covered in shells and resembling a walking tank, it appeared to have been exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerfully armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective staining, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow it to merge more quickly with its surroundings and avoid encountering enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature belonging to the nodosaur family was widely covered in print in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum lab worker Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group, who spent more than 7,000 hours excavating it painstakingly.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and shell plates on his body.
They discovered a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the protective coloring is well-prevalent, the discovery came as a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly larger than the size of the currently living animals with the protective coloring.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to disguise confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with a protective color – such as deer, zebras, or battleships – are much smaller and more accessible prey, indicating that the nodosaur had to seriously fight for survival.
“The serious threat from predators to the massive, highly armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the dinosaur's scales also indicates that its skin must have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was carried away into the sea, where it sank and lay down on the bottom of the ocean with its back.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely spreading far deeper into the land than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with the surviving scaly skin, and at the same time fully preserved in three dimensions, while retaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don’t have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just have to squint a little, and you can almost believe he’s asleep.”
The Cretaceous period is an era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, the thyreophore may have been hunted by one of its formidable ancestors.
These include the Acrocantosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 meters)-long monster weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was swept into the sea after his death and mummified in clay.
The creature was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved thyroid in the world, along with skin and armor, and it is intact, from the muzzle to the femur bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous thyreophore was difficult to tread on what is now Canada, until the spilled river swept it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its shell to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of skin still cover the bumpy shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is “rare as winning the lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
Fossilized skin remains still cover the bumpy shell plates that sprinkle the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are turned upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.”
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without having documents confirming his identity and nationality.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by the Polish edition Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his performance on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not speak Polish, although he tried to start speaking this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, the disgraced politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the application for obtaining citizenship of Ukraine was faked.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The term of the investigation in the case of Weinzicher and Olchowik has been extended until January
The term of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Evgeny Olkhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinzicher extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny court is considering the issue of extending the accused’s house arrest.
The representative of the UK at the meeting announced the decision to extend the term of the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and examine a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly paid bribes to the leadership of Komi.
Their total size is estimated at at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzicher, Olchovik, as well as the former head of Complex Energy Systems CJSC Mikhail Slobodin, who headed Vimpelcom until September 5, handed bribes to top officials of the Komi Republic for establishing the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinzicher and Olchowik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled the investigation and was put on a federal wanted list.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, viewing a Facebook tape on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from high school.
It said: “Police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he’s still lying in the middle of the street.”
Noticing that no one else from her tape posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were a lot of user posts with the nickname <0x40>TheePharoah.
A rapper from Greater St. Louis was tweeting about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown’s lifeless body, spread out in the middle of the street, where it will be for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was not something new for her and her circle.
She put down her phone and later in the evening returned to tweets that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown’s father holding a poster saying, “Ferguson policeman just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched the live broadcast as a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, pulled the trigger of the rifle and shouted, “I’m going to kill all of you... animals!”
“This is an unusual situation,” Ferrel said from her own recollections.
“This is not a murder like the ones we are used to and can be called typical.
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.”
She took a ticket for the return flight and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson for the next three years was the theme of the new documentary Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience in terms of people living in a community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower and a wreath for the color, they remembered the conversation they had had so far this morning countless times, "about the experience of blacks and their situation."
She recalls saying, “Remember when I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We’re going to Ferguson now because a police officer killed an 18-year-old boy and it was wrong.”
“I couldn’t help but take it,” Ferrel said later.
“What’s happening today is the culmination of what’s happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and grow on it.
She should not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of blacks and their situation, and what we must do to become free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would be doing her a bad service if I kept her out of it.”
When they arrived at Ferguson, the first stop they made was at South Florissant Road, a site across the street from the police station that became something of a tent camp, while activists awaited reports of Officer Darren Wilson’s final non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who prepared lunch packages.
They collected the packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Gradually, Ferrel took on a new type of activism.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and was committed to food justice and health inequality among black communities.
“I had no experience as an organizer.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said she and her chief cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell came up with the question: “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?”
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community in order to benefit from its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We’ve heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don’t get in the spotlight, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project from Ferrell and six other locals with whom the Whose Streets Project team had been in touch for years after Brown's murder.
“In this documentary, it’s not someone talking for us or with us, it’s us talking,” Davis said.
“It was most important to me how these people would be presented, because that’s how I would be presented myself.”
While the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the leader-rescuer, but about how the community unites,” Folayan said – she turned out to be the most open-minded of the film’s participants.
As a result, Whose Streets? reveals unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing about the first time I saw the finished product.
“But I knew that when you do that kind of work and humanize blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story re-discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the “Black Life Matters” movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 – classify themselves as homosexual.
“Black gay women in leadership positions support this movement,” Ferrell says, “because we’re constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of gay black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination" and that Ferrell was not chosen as the film's central character due to her distinctive features.
“She was the one who awakened that energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it’s no coincidence that she was at the forefront, because when”
You can feel its energy through the screen.”
Ferguson, meanwhile, has long been out of cameras, but there are complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which she calls home, simply: “Bardak”.
She's still clinging to the language she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”

The emergence of similarity: the artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall at the Friedman Gallery in New York, people's faces hang from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all somewhat elusively similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from brushes on her cheeks and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The emergence of similarity".
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident who was commuted by Barack Obama just three days before the end of his presidency.
After analyzing the DNA obtained from Manning using a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of the faces that people with such a genome might have, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, though not easy to perceive, manifesto devoted not only to the plasticity of DNA data – different ways of their interpretation and the inherent determinism of these interpretations – but also to the intrinsic determinism of these.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has openly said she considers herself a woman since adolescence, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Espionage, Computer Fraud and Theft Act.
Her photos in prison were inaccessible, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie in which Manning in a platinum-shaded wig, clearly feeling awkward, sits behind the wheel of a car; with this photo she began to be associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project Visions of Strangers.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as cigars and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this debris and creating images of what these people could look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited or photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait created from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, Repressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which portrayed how in the future the president would mitigate Chelsea’s punishment and allow her to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama actually decided to release Manning just days after the book was released was a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in a Kansas military prison.
There’s something deep and powerful about the exhibition opening right now, as Donald Trump declares war on people disclosing classified information in the government and invents new ways to stir up animosity on Twitter that he’s meant to mitigate.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said that "nothing happens by chance."
In the artist’s statement written on the gallery wall, Manning’s huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a dot over the “i” in her last name) calls for an end to “automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of pencil-written C, G, and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist exquisitely puts it), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how remarkably similar we all are, at least in terms of our biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is to be interpreted and how subjective it is,” Dewey-Harborg said; her 2007 video work False Memories is also exhibited here.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.”
The last part of the exposition, fitting in the same room, is the above-mentioned novel in comics.
On it, Manning in the style of King Kong appears above the US Correctional Barracks building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
“Never be silent.”
“This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me,” says the artist, greeting us from Philadelphia.
"I still get tingly on my skin when I talk about it."
Manning had not yet seen the exhibition in person — as the comic strips foreshadowed — but when she arrived, she would be welcomed by the masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacra, gathered like crowds of protesters.
This was also done intentionally, as everyone at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, height Manning), on which genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
“I used to hang them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
“I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood behind her liberation.”
A Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee is wanted by police on murder charges
According to police, a nationwide raid is underway on Northwestern University professors and an Oxford University employee, who are wanted as suspects in connection with the fact that a man was found stabbed to death in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the records of the Cook County Court, arrest warrants were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to release on bail of forty-two-year-old Windham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranloh.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranloh died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they came to the apartment complex "Grand Plaza" and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranloh was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death from stab wounds, considering it a murder, while police are intensively searching for the two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, the university’s vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and was barred from entering Northwestern University campuses.
“It is now a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbaj said.
Warren is a Senior Fellow at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have been in contact with the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the US investigative authorities.”
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chief of Communications of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said that he strongly advises suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have speculations about their whereabouts, but our efforts to find them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police officer was called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene awful.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirms that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza issued an appeal to the guests, in which it was reported: “At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA roadmap in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in fulfilling the requirements was passed, RUSADA was given the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated accordingly,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap for restoring compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA’s work and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could pose difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be fulfilled.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping agencies must publicly acknowledge the results of the WADA-mandated investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sport is controlled by the state.
Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what did not happen.”
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian newspaper Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the previous problems in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Without a doubt, no one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from conducting doping controls in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to WADA’s Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to resume its work.
Fire extinguishes in 79-story tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, has been put out.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 MSK).
Local authorities said no one was injured as a result of the incident.
At the time of extinguishing the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for this occurrence are not yet known.
Earlier it was reported that in Dubai burning 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All residents were evacuated on time.
Unimaginable outfit Buzova shook fans: pants that do not cover the panties
The scandalous host of the reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova amazed the audience of the festival Europa Plus Live with dancing in panties.
In front of thousands of fans, the new singer duet with Nastya Kudri performed the song "We will be hot".
Both girls went on stage in provocative "pants", sewn in such a way that the singer's underwear was visible.
On the trousers were made inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported that changes in the appearance of Buzova commented on the specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine.”
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and blamed the U.S. Congress.
Yekaterinburg metro masters a new method of payment
In October, travel in the Yekaterinburg metro can be paid by a bank card, said the general director of OJSC "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with the "oblast newspaper".
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 FIFA World Cup the same system of subway fares as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want fans from other countries, the guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without buying tokens and not standing in line,” he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become the next "Uber"
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among her startup employees in the field of e-commerce, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
“He’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs a 75-person San Francisco-based e-commerce firm called Madison Reed.
Therefore, she turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new type of startup in the field of human resources, which help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing employee engagement software, they allow companies to conduct rapid surveys, contact specific teams and demographics, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and contact management directly.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, but where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Redwood City startup Glint, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has achieved a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel over the three years of using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in a visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are gradually realizing that they need to control the environment in the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber, which was involved in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive environment in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the financial technology portal Let’s Talk About Payments, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid a decline in Uber’s reputation.
Convertent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized staff surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
“The court of public opinion seized power from the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is mistreating employees or behaving unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of boycotts from customers, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are up-to-date with the rules and procedures and offer an easy way to contact the company’s headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for the phone number or email of the head office, file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, head of Ruby Tuesday’s legal department, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be quickly detected and addressed.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees,” said Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees.”
According to Queenland, the companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical misconduct as a result of the Enron case.
But it wasn’t until “social media” became widespread that companies realized they couldn’t keep their dirty underwear from spreading virally online.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has received the approval of venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company’s total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company’s total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research demonstrates that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than they used to.
In markets with fierce competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the minimum.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated, and that they dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, feel heard, and feel that the work they are doing is delivering results, they are more committed to making such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, vice president of global employee satisfaction and benefits at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors make a profit when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it’s no surprise that they find support.
According to cultural experts in the workplace, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if the changes do not come quickly enough, or do not come at all, disappointment may develop, and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be prepared to do 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who had to see companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go all the way, the staff will be like, ‘Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
If you don’t care, why shouldn’t I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day as someone reports a problem via Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it retain employees more effectively in an industry known for high turnover.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul open a new asphalt on the avenue of the Red Army
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the cause of the failures of asphalt on the Red Army Avenue.
The place where two holes appeared on the newly paved roadway (crossing with the street Youth), it was decided to "open".
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramways was due to the fact that the land in the area of the unmanaged unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Road Management, Improvement, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be conducted for a detailed survey and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the formwork of out-of-house communications and their concreting.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team had to train longer because the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day.
Time is approaching 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles, is delayed to chat on one side of the team’s new training fields located on campus.
Some of them pulled off their T-shirts, revealing their backs shining with sweat after a tense first day at the sports camp.
For many team players, these minutes of idleness constitute a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to the dorms after a three-hour training session to prepare for the final exams, and return to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning for meetings at 6:30 a.m.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, “These guys are going to have a meat grinder for the next three days.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled twice-a-day workouts, which was invented to reduce the load on players, actually lengthened their working day — at least until the end of exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the team of the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
A side effect of not having two training sessions a day has been more days with one training session, and Bruins moves the start of the camp almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 training sessions until August 20, before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the A&M University of Texas team in September.
Mora said he supports the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that because of it, another item has appeared in the tight schedule of players.
“Within three or four days, we’re giving them this huge load, it’s a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just got over it, they’re working, they’re great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
When the camp ends, the University of California, Los Angeles, will close the training sessions; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjoining parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs that have crossed the safety net behind the goal.
Players from the Bruins should occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Mora said.
“It’s a serious problem, and I’m not exaggerating the danger of suggesting that someone might rent a room, sit there and record training on video.
If you have a video of training, it is very serious.
But we're gonna have security there and there's gonna be security in parking lot eight.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All victims of the terrorist attack in the metro of St. Petersburg in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the vice-governor Anna Mityanina.
At the end of July, three people remained in the hospitals, reports "TV Center".
We will remind, the explosion in the metro of St. Petersburg occurred on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarjon Dzhalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Asimov, were arrested.
On the eve of the Rospotrebnadzor recommended the metro of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular, increasing the number of frames of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of hoaxes to independent experts and show their conclusions under the original posts, the world’s largest social network, which is trying to fight so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them for verification, and possibly show fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to disseminate so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also been actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports ahead of the May presidential election, and in Germany, ahead of the September election, they said they supported a plan to penalize social media if they did not promptly remove hate posts.
In a separate German-language statement on Thursday, Facebook said it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing which posts are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share,” Sarah Sue, Facebook news feed manager, wrote in her block.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the feature of “related articles” and work on other newsfeed changes to address the issue of fake news.
Create a novel-comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scottie’s tiny castle was filmed in the music video “Squeeze,” and in the 70s and 80s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy location in the Beale River Valley in Kent, he watched the tumultuous history around and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a hairspin and a penchant for historical documents, to a comic book novel.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel so personal when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells the story of the families who lived in Skotney; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This isn’t Rhodes’ first book to be based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote Dead Man’s Teeth and Other Stories, a collection of British Library documents that suddenly touched his heart.
“I could have been touched by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites,” he says.
"That's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell of smoke, because in those days to light the fire was lit.
And in 300 years, in the future, you feel like you're there, too.
I love the archives!”
For a person so passionate about old paperwork, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months (“I’ve gotten a little bit stuck in there”) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the "new" Victorian castle, going through the archives and examining the numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles lying in the ditch for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then, at night, he “drank whiskey and sat down to write.”
The history of Skotney Castle is not much studied because the National Endowment only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were just beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as "something that aristocrats have dumped on the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," Rhodes says, "but two families fought for this birch.
It happens, guys!”
In some of the collection's stories, the castle becomes the starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
“There is evidence of a riot that took place at the castle in 1380 in a book called The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,” Rhodes says.
“The peasant uprising began in these places, and I thought the uprising was a good start.
“Maybe they were connected?”
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, "The Priest", which tells the story of a Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler", about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stuffing the coffin with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of all that lived in Skotney: "Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect junkie, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Throughout the generations, the Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women—I see them as a company of cute guys who know how to care for the heiress of great fortunes.”
After graduating from the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish outback, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eljamjanmäki - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it was again overgrown with forest.
But Scotty is still a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he says.
“I felt like, ‘Damn, I have to get back to real life.’”
Fifteen of the largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC Otkritie, seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of organizations that have left ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that declared a break with ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", headed by the famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, incidentally, by the results of the last session of the draft law and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and deputy.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, implying a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the president of ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which are thus trying to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, in Tosunyan’s opinion, does not always justify the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many heads of the fined banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive to relations with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, stating their disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia", noting that "the efficiency of the ARB's work is actually being carried out at a low level".
Investors will be better off.
What's the end of it?
We will immediately answer the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or near it: depositors are not threatened by anything, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Headed by “Russia” Anatoly Aksakov, known for his diligence in all matters concerning the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued at the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of “regionals”.
In terms of personnel and organization, obviously, there are also no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential actors with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, this oldest organization, founded in 1991, advocating the interests of the banking community, has considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in general.
It is not possible to say that the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept new members on any terms, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe too much will want"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary Gazette, said that "literally the next day the representatives of our association" the potential "Roya on ARB banks asked me
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, and the agenda for an extraordinary conference of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll decide.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, emphasizing that "he does not hold on to the chair", called a possible new head of the updated association "Russia" George Luntovsky, who leaves the post of deputy chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for a day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association “Russia”, where it is planned to consider the issue of the agenda of the extraordinary congress “Russia”.
The entry of cars with a gasoline engine in major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of transport Nikolay Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine in major cities of Russia will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually raise the ecological class.
And there the concept immediately move to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is, from what year?
It's a phrase at the level of slogans - let's ban it.
Where and when?
- Tomorrow?
Shut down the whole town?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe it will happen," Prime quoted the minister as saying.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support for electric transport, submitted to the government by the General Director of PJSC KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, - the use of cars with ICE in major cities and resorts.
Washington changes the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan includes reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas, and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the financial resources that allow them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us
Before we had time to think that 2017 could not get worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots came out.
Mm-hmm.
Sex robots are in the spotlight right now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
“People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending them out in large numbers to consumers, and we’re going to see a lot more of them soon,” Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable counterparts to robots with silicone skin that is warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “tune” their robots to their taste, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot’s nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" compared to which Stepford's Wife would seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone leather.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize robots with qualities they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion that come with a pre-programmed personality – for example, Cold Farra looks shy, and Wild Wendy has a “bold” character.
“Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly,” True Companion wrote.
So she loves what you love, she doesn’t like what you don’t like, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be in the mood!”
There are many worries about the emergence of sex robots — not least because they replace real human relationships — but the most worrisome is the subordinate image of a woman, associated with rape, which causes the mastery of the Cold (read: resisting) Lighthouse.
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared with a vibrator, only for men.
“If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will certainly not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture for the time being.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots emerged just when women’s rights around the world were threatened, with a president in the White House bragging about harassing women.
The scariest thing about The Maid's Tale is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and squeezed eyes, but how realistic the vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it does not seem so great now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical resemblance to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look human to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is by their "character" that robots do not resemble real women.
They cannot break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life of their own, no biography—nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been playing for Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was reported by the general manager of the "blue-yellow" Andrei Lebedev in an interview with BeBasket.
We've been trying to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately, he's not coming for family reasons.
We will go to EuroBasket without a naturalized player because we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
“This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players,” he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian national team took a record sixth place at the Eurobasket 2013 and for the first time got to the world championship in basketball, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the United States scored an average of 15.4 points for the game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since leaving the post of head coach of our national team, the American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The men’s EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their matches of the group tournament on the Promised Land.
Evgeny Murzin's wards in Group B will have five fights: with Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men’s national team held two control matches, in which they lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great deed?
Pretending to be Mitt Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the common ground was the fact that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate had broken up some families on a micro-level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers swamped with columns about how to deal with the horrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to burst.
Less talk about Trump’s ability to reunite families.
I write about this because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago who had long been on the knife with Republicans in her family, came to see me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Under Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother, with whom she has been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
Dinner is undoubtedly good; but I cannot help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into the left, but the distorting effect of his rule could move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we are referring to the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop being amazed by his tricks.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing Mitt Romney’s old-fashioned madness today – with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) – compared to Trump, both seem very small evils.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his head to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin drove downtown, we went with the kids to the Central Park Carousel – the largest carousel in the New York City Department of Parks’ household and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are terrible and huge, the images of fiberglass on the central drum - grimace clowns and animals, which, bent, in horror look at their backs - are extremely sinister, and the ringing music, strangely enough, brings delight.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from skyscrapers become obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too bored to cause fear, and the reality of the city does not catch up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I am still living through the day when I learned that the Swiss Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the theme pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" does not count), but a large circular intersection in North London.
A carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two years, a child of eleven years and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could give the carousel a score, I would give it an A, but fortunately no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to rate my shopping “experience” on a scale of one to five stars before running a card through the terminal.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street the same thing plus the option to accompany the tip rate of 15 percent is for ordering at the counter.
As a result, not only is the neutral interaction slowed down, but it is also necessary to bring a personal attitude to a situation that does not imply it.
The poor shopkeeper in the department store was smiling confusingly while I was tired of evaluating my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
Pistorius leaves prison for a second visit to the doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on the wrists, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder after the prosecutor's office appealed the initial conviction for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp early on Valentine’s Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the door of a toilet at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he thought his girlfriend was a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The prosecutor’s office announced its intention to file another protest, this time against Pretorius’ six-year term, which it said was too mild.
The Attorney General’s Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be heard later this year.
The term of Pretorius could be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor’s office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect in the beating of a journalist of NTV selected a subscription on no-departure
Metropolitan law enforcement agencies have chosen a measure of restraint in the form of a non-exit subscription for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvozhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of a criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code ("Beatings") against a 32-year-old man who struck the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after Gorky, the suspect was chosen a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription to stay and proper behavior," she said.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up against the suspect for police disobedience.
On Wednesday, August 2, during the live broadcast of the Day of the Airborne Forces, a drunken man approached the correspondent and slapped him in the face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the air force.
According to Razvozhayev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people setting up tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens, was detained in Sithonia.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel “BT-V” that the citizens of Bulgaria were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone caught parking in an unintended location.
Inspections will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accuses US Vice President of Cold War rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence, was criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly sliding down to primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War era, which are completely detached from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Thus, the Foreign Ministry reacted to the words of Pence about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly redraw borders, said to him in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the non-obviousness of the thesis about the allegedly non-alternative accession of Southeastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the US that violated international law by using force to secede Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop shaming Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The accident occurred in the suburb of Stupino, as a result of a collision of a foreign car with an ambulance "Ambulance" suffered a paramedic.
Today, around 08:10 Moscow time, a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned over," the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region told TASS.
At the scene of the accident, law enforcement officers are working, the circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son at the construction site, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
In the evening of August 3, the Razdelnyansky police department received a message from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
"To the scene of the incident went law enforcement officers and doctors, who promptly took the child to a medical institution," - reported in the Odessa head of the National police.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
During the priority operational and investigative measures, the identity of the pregnant woman - a 36-year-old local resident - was established.
It is also established that the woman has three other young children.
As noted in the head, in the field of view of law enforcement officers, the family has not previously fallen into and on special account was not.
At present, the police are establishing the circumstances and reasons that forced the woman to this act, after which a procedural decision will be made.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby into a garbage pipeline.
Grigory Leps: "I rush into battle, although 55 - not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian pop scene Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th anniversary next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke with the columnist of "Izvestia".
I remember when your "fifty-one" was celebrated.
A special tent in Luzhniki, Gloria Gaynor singing for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
I'm sure you were thinking about how you'd like to spend your next five-year.
Did the plans come true?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I worked hard, toured the country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I’m not the same person as I was 20 years ago.
Biological clocks are not deceiving.
Singing like I did in my 30s is getting harder.
But I'm still fighting, I don't want to stop.
With new people, I think I’m on a different level.
You're making a new album with them, the first one in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it right now.
Actually, we've already recorded it all in my studio, and now we're going to send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" after the song of the same name, which was written together with Timothy.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put her out yet.
We'll do that later, when we've got the video on it.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
Your new record was hand-in-handed by great American drummer Chris Coleman.
Did you want to include him on your tour?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his games.
I invited him to join my band, and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. – “Izvestia”) offered.
But for prolonged work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
We were talking about fees from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And I found a great drummer, Max Malyshev.
It is better to feed oneself (smiling).
Sometimes I want to get on with one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wy, after listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come, with a different performing technique."
Your album is made in Los Angeles, American musicians collaborate with you, but you yourself still can not come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
To be honest, I'm not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I am truly sorry that I can’t get to America.
I’ve told you many times that I’m studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We are not stupider than them, but we do not have such experience, schools.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years were not at all the tasks that were always solved by American musicians.
They wanted the highest quality sound.
I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has denied me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa at the British embassy every year to be allowed to go there again and most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not an ordered one, but a poster, right?
Yes, Monte Carlo has a good Sporting Hall, I've been there once.
They have been invited again and, as far as I know, all the tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
Will you go to the "Rendev Laima Vaikule", which will begin on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lima is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman who knows how to present herself with beautiful vocals, and even whispers.
After tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you once again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third one come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same serving as he did himself.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to get Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it goes.
You gradually introduced the songs of Boris Grebenshikov into your repertoire.
Why don't you make an album of his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed with him several times and asked: Can I sing one of his songs?
He replied, "Gregory, I write songs to be performed."
Please try, sing.
It would be interesting to record such an album.
So far I do not have such a task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
If you don't focus on your production center.
I suppose, before you realize his potential, you haven't signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would like to have under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Sergey is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in "The Voice".
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a shame if he did not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to pick up his repertoire, I'm shooting clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, pay poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they will receive a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I would be delighted if one of them achieved commercial success and paid me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to shut down the oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, break through, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered a tour of Ukraine and guaranteed entry to the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
These are mostly closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, by my own conviction flew to Syria on the same plane, which then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that it is necessary to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
I don’t care what other bloggers or critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that such a situation happened with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it is a pity that now they can not fully spill their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music is meant to unite and entertain people.
I would like to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at the moment...
Andrei Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known "Kommersant", the technical director of the cosmodrome Vostochny Andrei Okhlopkov began to work at the State Space Research and Production Center (SSCPC) named after Khrunichev.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the Operation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), he was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Fili, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director will most likely be abolished, and functionality will be scattered across the CENCI divisions.
The fact that the technical director of Vostochny and deputy general director of CENCI for technological development Andrei Okhlopkov moved to work at the Khrunichev SCPC, "Kommersant" told top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working on a new post for several weeks," Kommersant's interlocutors in the industry said.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from CENCI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information "Kommersant" was officially confirmed in the SCNCP.
He decided to move to the position of director for coordination of production, - stated at the enterprise. - Andrei Okhlopkov set before him the task of ensuring the minimum launch for the first launch at the Vostochny cosmodrome fully fulfilled.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to work at CENKI in 2013, having service in space troops, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome, he held the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, from his filing, regional merchants received state orders for rollbacks, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean up detached parts of launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The tasks assigned to him in the CENCI for technological development were extended to various projects, but the main one of them was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
The head of the Federal Space Agency Oleg Ostapenko in an interview with Kommersant directly said that the situation in the Eastern “was critical already in October 2013.”
The fact is that during the planning, a strategic error was made: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch before the end of the year, the construction was decided six months earlier and the deadline was shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to go for a trick: CENCI specialists began to carry out parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished objects.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and the transfer that took place (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, a source told Kommersant at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would still not have carried out a single launch from the East, but would have been engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversaw the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his "space Susanin", but it was from him that he almost always asked for information about the progress of construction.
Mr. Okhlopkov remembered the frankness: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only performer in the Eastern and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?"
This idea has received support from the government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the duties of the general contractor to complete the construction and installation works at the launch and technical complex for the planned launches in the fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for Mr. Okhlopkov’s transition to a new place of work was disagreements with the CENCI management about the methods of completing the construction of facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontractors.
“It was decided that it would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the Eastern.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find him an equivalent replacement."
According to Kommersant, this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered across the CENCI divisions.
In music schools there will be a program of training in two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Sviatoslav Golubenko, for this you can re-read the students the repetitive disciplines, and the issue of payment for the rest of the classes in the second specialty to solve with the help of special grants.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and together with the expert community we will develop a mechanism that will allow us to master two specialties, but at the same time it will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin’s “Nedetsky Conversation” with pupils of the Sirius Children’s Center, the student Maria Andreeva reported that she was forced to pay for recurring subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she studies violin and piano classes and has competition awards in both directions.
The head of state recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, detained climbed the wall on the skyscraper 17-year-old Russian
In Mexico, detained 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital of Mexico City.
The young man with the help of two unknown men crossed a three-meter fence on the territory of the complex of office buildings of the company Nestle and independently climbed one of its towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
A young man was arrested on the roof.
Officials at the Ministry of Public Security dropped him on the ground in a helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They find out whether the boy is legally on the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a tower has become popular on the Web.
Users called the young man "spider man".
As the media writes, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help ease IBD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may help relieve symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to alleviate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the intestine make sure that harmful microbes coming from food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to start the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is disturbed too much towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in the intestine, appear to increase the tolerance of cells.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one species of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of tolerant cells.
The more tryptophan the mice were fed, the more of these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of immune-tolerant cells, found that one group of mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same lineage but was kept separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice — communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the gut cells of mice was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but missing in mice without immune cells.
Mice raised in a sterile environment, who did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of the liquid — bacteria-free — to underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have evolved into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells also halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragán explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the byproducts of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but humans suffering from inflammatory bowel disease have been found to have defects in genes associated with tryptophan.
She says: "We may need to increase the development of these cells, because the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri could potentially lead to an expansion of their population."
According to Jose Mourinho, "Manchester United" hired a "genius" in the face of Nemanja Matich
Manchester United has hired a "genius" in the person of Nemanja Matich, Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The <0xC2><0xA3>40 million Chelsea player started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression as a midfielder, while players such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were pro.
However, since Matic did not participate in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he withstood only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires refinement before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is in the way he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We will help him prepare sooner rather than later.”
Like Matic, his new teammates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began forming his squad by the start of the following season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
“I’m grateful to the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
“I’d be even more happy if they got me four out of four, but they’ve already done a lot for me.”
Former Lithuanian Social Democrats urge them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Ministers Algirdas Butkievi<0xC4><0x8D>ius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Sejm from the Social Democrats, <0xC4><0x8C>eslovas Jur<0xC5><0xA1>enas, appealed to party members to stay in the ruling coalition.
Due to frictions with partners - the Union of Peasants and the Greens - a discussion has been initiated in the Social Democratic Party whether it should remain in the ruling coalition.
And here three senior experienced comrades addressed to the party with an open letter, which, in particular, says: "It is understandable disappointment comrades in the party with the election results, but the coalition with the "peasants" has created for us, albeit not very easy, but still conditions for the further implementation of the goals of social justice, which on our initiative are provided by the center of the party in the program of the government, and for the preservation of the political.
According to the former leaders of the party, the discussion has so far been dominated by “emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments”.
The letter’s authors fear that their party’s ill-considered actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
The Moscow City Court commuted the sentence of the disabled wheelchair user Anton Mamaev from four and a half years imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazev court, the convict was released from the detention center.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, since he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a scooter from a former Special Forces soldier.
The Moscow City Court reduced the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles. fine.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility," said the press secretary of the Moscow City Court Uliana Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamayev, the factual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a penalty below the lower limit.
As for the assistant of Mamaev Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would become the basis for changing the category of severity of the conviction and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an acquittal, intending to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out appealing the verdict in the cassation court of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in the criminal case in the autumn of last year.
A disabled man claims that he bought a scooter from acquaintances for 160 thousand rubles. to then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years in prison with serving his sentence in a colony of general regime (under part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under President Tatyana Moskalkova, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamaev was released from the detention center by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
ONF will prepare a report to the President on the environment
The final "Forum of Action" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed by the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexey Anisimov.
According to him, at the end of the forum, the “front-liners” plan to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the domestic environment, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Interlocutors of "Izvestia" in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain "deep analysis" of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key events of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been and will be expressed at these events, we will form systemic proposals to solve environmental problems, the interlocutor in the ONF told Izvestia.
The co-chair of the Central Headquarters of the movement, Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the “front-line personnel” will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the “Forum of Action” of the ONF are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we have grown a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, seen gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the “front-line personnel” are also reporting on work on priority projects of the ONF,” Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental activities, ecology and transport, Sergei Ivanov, will be invited to the forum.
Earlier, he had already taken part in the work of the Mediaforum of the ONF, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to run environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years to come.
To these issues did not fall out of the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
Head of the Laboratory of Regional Policy of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI) Andrey Kolyadin noted: raising environmental issues, ONF acts in accordance with the presidential agenda.
They offered many things as experts at various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president," Andrei Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that today the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded, which can give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the UNF, the regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by a "straight line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a draft law on the prohibition of open transshipment of coal in settlements has already been developed, one of the authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue lies in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - says the head of the charitable foundation "Ecology for All" Leonid Bochin.
A member of the Human Rights Council, the head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace of Russia Sergey Tsyplenkov, in a conversation with Izvestia, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is needed for a successful solution of environmental problems, and legislative efforts alone are not enough.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change," Tsyplenkov said.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that the violation of environmental legislation is an economically advantageous solution for business.
British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and the car on the swing of the hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office and even start the car with a simple swing of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now, through his firm, BioTech, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives at the expense of technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, anesthesiologist-consultant from Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure was performed in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip, which is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company also replaces locks in homes and cars with compatible chips at a price of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car “BMW Z4”, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
White House Props Cost Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision last month to drive a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the "Marine One" when the president is on board, became a central element of the July 17 event at the White House, which demonstrated American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials inspected technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was put up next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truckloader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Marine Helicopters (HMX-1), the department responsible for controlling the helicopter, the White House Military Administration ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of the "unusual" event.
“I just wanted to make sure you knew because this is an unusually widely reported event,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his boss, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, the day before the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in the event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. that day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the restrictions on working hours.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the guards of the unit remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records obtained by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether a second crew was needed as a result.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event does not contradict this decree.
“Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were told no,” the commander wrote.
“It looks like you have nowhere to go,” the deputy chief replied.
"Made in America" was declared an official event by the White House and was not covered by Hatch's law.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to advance health care reform, which was under development in the Senate at the time, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But asking for them only in the interests of photography is unusual.
Trump had already been the subject of discussion in February, when the presidential plane drove into the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with messages complaining of his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” White House deputy spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and on the South Lawn to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with an inch accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight, made for the event "Made in America", was credited to the crew to the account of the necessary training flights for the month.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 extra hours that day as part of “non-presidential support tasks.”
According to the White House, taxpayers did not bear the costs of any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky said that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the South lawn.
HMX-1 does not record the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the Department of Defense’s hourly rates for 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense’s reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit records that the aircraft in the air time was 30 minutes in each direction from its airfield based at the aviation base of the Marine Corps Quantico in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on an approximate reimbursement rate is completely wrong,” Walters says.
“These indicative rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual appropriations.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was defending the use of a helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week the things made in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
Therefore, it is absolutely appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat in the driver’s seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump appealed to Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of products of the company.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three.”
Moscow will allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Annually, grants "Saving Lives" will be allocated to intensive care units and intensive care units of metropolitan medical clinics.
Funds will be made to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the Yudina City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a thank-you letter to the traumatologist-orthopedic doctor Victor Protsko, under whose leadership a complex operation was carried out to reconstruct the adolescent’s foot.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants annually to intensive care units and intensive care units of urban clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of Moscow, the Yudina Clinical Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to conduct unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomenskoye rural hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the intensive care and hospital, there are day wards.
The hospital employs 2,800 people.
The total area occupying the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-term hospitals (SCU).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
After the operation in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year, 36,000 patients were hospitalized at the Yudina Clinical Hospital.
Medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
The NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
On Friday, August 4, reports TASS with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni to coordinate the indirect (through Paritytbank) acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of Sberbank was withdrawn.
“Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of shares of Sberbank in the NBU have not been received,” – stated in the message.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenia withdrew his application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for checking their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian “daughter” to the consortium Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which was Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.
Trailer of the third season of “Narco”: in the popular Netflix series after the death of Pablo Escobar, the central role is played by the Cali cartel
Despite the fact that the second season of Narco revealed the identity of the killer Pablo Escobar, the Netflix series is far from complete.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are planned, and the third has already been presented with the first trailer showing the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the attention of the Agency for Drug Control attracted the richest organization of drug traffickers - the Cali cartel.

The leader of the cartel is Hilberto Rodríguez Orejuela (Damián Alcázar), Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela (Francis Denis) - her brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of communications with Mexico, and Cepe Santacruz-Londoño (Pepe Rapasote) works in New York.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character who draws American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to his side to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Mathias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Vilan, Angel Sylvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of “Narco” will be released on the screens on September 1.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative if they involve all members of society, including women, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overstated,” he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative if women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections for provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban threatens to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of the international force from combat operations to the role of advisers.
This year’s election is the first time that power has passed peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
Of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women, according to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan.
The Prosecutor General’s Office approved the indictment in the case of Nikita Belykh
The Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia has approved an indictment in a criminal case against former Governor of the Kirov region Nikita Belykh, accused of receiving a large bribe.
On Thursday, August 3, reported in the department, reports RIA Novosti.
The materials were transferred to the Presnensky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, tightened penalties for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened the fines for swimming in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be demanded from those who arrange a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, reports TASS with reference to the Association of tour operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for inscriptions on monuments 400 euros and for garbage 25 euros.
To inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of a special company "Enjoy, Respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) in social networks, as well as through ads and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the largest concentration of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice tourism adviser Paola Mar, the information about the fines will be transferred to the embassies of the home countries of the violators, in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,” she said.
In April, the Italian city administration announced plans to limit tourist flows.
In Venice, there is already a successful restriction on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wanting to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were allowed to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium was imposed on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
In the first half of 2017, the State Border Service detained 272 illegal migrants at the border with the EU countries; a total of 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This was reported in the State Border Service.
Of these, 314 people were detained for illegal crossing the border, and the rest for violating the rules of residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other offences.
The largest number - 717 illegal migrants were detained at the border with Moldova.
At the border with EU countries, 272 illegal migrants were detained, most of them at the border with Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania.
According to statistics, among the detained illegal migrants are mainly citizens of Moldova, Russia, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India and Armenia.
In addition, almost 2,000 potential illegal migrants were not missed in Ukraine.
In the EU found an unusual way to get rid of migrants.
Jazz in "Skolkovo": experiment and improvisation
The program of the second Skolkovo Jazz Science Festival, which will be held on August 26 at the Skolkovo Innovation Center, has been announced.
Guests will enjoy performances by leading jazz groups and soloists, scientific discussions, interactive platforms and other musical and intellectual events.
As the organizers promise, the site will become a territory of improvisation and a field for demonstrating new creative possibilities.
“The guests of the festival will be able to immerse themselves in the world of experimental media technologies and learn how innovations in science become a new tool for interaction with art,” Elena Zelentsova, vice president of the Skolkovo Foundation, described the focus of the forum.
Among the participants of Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017 are many stars, including the Moscow Jazz Orchestra of Igor Butman, which will present a joint program with vocalist Yaroslava Simonova.
Jazz and science are related concepts, and it is no coincidence that they have come together, - the people's artist "Izvestia" explained.
The experiment and improvisation of jazzmen are valued as highly as scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be the performance of Azekel, a British of Nigerian origin, known both for his own creativity and joint work with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
Jazz fans are looking forward to the performances of the first five-time Grammy Award nominee, pianist Christian Sands (USA) with his trio.

In the special vinyl zone it will be possible to purchase records of current jazz performers and representatives of other musical directions, and at the book fair - publications on various topics, including music, popular science and biomedical literature.
SF dismissed Ozerov from the position of the head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the chairman of the defense and security committee Viktor Ozerov and dismissed him from this post.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk Krai.
A statement asking for his release from the post of the Lakers wrote last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to “change the rhythm of life”.
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Since 1996, Viktor Ozerov has represented the legislative assembly of the Khabarovsk Territory in the SF of the Russian Federation.
The senator has been chairing the Defense and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for residents and for commodity producers of Buryatia
Efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers for decades are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients is reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity and Power Market and to the Consolidated Forecast Balance of Electricity Production and Supply (Power) within the Unified Energy System of the Russian Federation for the Subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017 No. 842) established indicative prices for electricity and power consumption of the Republic of Belarus.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryatia commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic beat the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to equate the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants on the Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which Buryatia is.
It was only this year that the movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles. / kWh to 3.93 rubles. / kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the features of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established, it is the turn of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt / hour.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for new tariff movements in the downward direction for Buryatia.
Scooter was not afraid of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine and flew to the Crimea

This is reported by the website “Komsomolskaya Pravda”.
It is known that the first episode will be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations as part of the action "Night in the subway".

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at McVitie’s factory in Glasgow.
The union is demanding guarantees from McVitie’s managers over its long-term manufacturing commitment at its Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company bypassed the question of future investments in the cross-border facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, reports that it has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in case of any changes in the operation of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union “will find out about them first”.
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded McVitie’s response to concerns that funding would not be released for upgrading production lines.
Drew Duffy, a senior organizer, said: “Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the facility’s general manager on the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and on the territory of Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living standards and chronic decline in production, the East End of Glasgow desperately needs to thrive in McVitie’s factory.
According to Pladis, “The head of the Tolcross facility received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB just yesterday, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with employees and union representatives.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives at Tolcross, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to our employees about the fact that, like all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all our facilities and activities – in order to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our cross-border facility, especially in production lines and improved functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in the operation of this facility, employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to know about it.”
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHK) should be connected to the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as to Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the contradictions.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that the relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHK jeopardizes the implementation period of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the Rosneft perimeter, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to be allowed to use for the Eastern Petrochemical Company gas from the Kirinskoye field of Gazprom, located on the shelf of Sakhalin.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on this issue are continuing, and "there are no sharp corners there."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
“La Liga” member may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record raid three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when a Ligue 1 club was poised to break the world record for the cost of transition, more than double the previous mark associated with Paul Pogba’s return to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89m.
When the transition is over, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week net.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the way the offer was made and how Neymar terminated the contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn’t the football world warned about this possibility three years ago by PSG’s president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to recruit one of PSG’s top players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’re going against them, we’re going to make offers to their players,” al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, there will be consequences for them.”
Apparently, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the midfielder from PSG Marco Verratti.
PSG has made it clear that they will not release the Italian player under any conditions, and now Barcelona probably feels the consequences of his offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin instructed to deal with payments to victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed to understand the material assistance, which is allocated to the victims of forest fires residents and for the construction of new housing.
Today I would like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, I ask you to report on the situation with payments, compensation to the affected citizens.
I have some differences.
“On this occasion, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated,” Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the plenipotentiary representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergei Menyailo and the head of the head of the Baikal branch of the Glavrybvod FGBU Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about cleaning up the lake.
Then they showed the fry in an open container next to the container, which was prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin let some of the kids out of the sack.
Then he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the others.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to understand the environmental situation in Baikal and build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, and allegedly another volume is provided.
"I want to understand what is actually happening there with our financing," the Russian leader stressed.
Recall that in the course of forest fires in 2017 the fire covered the settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region, were destroyed residential buildings and outbuildings.

The project is focused on the HoReCa segment, retail and offices.
In Russia, two new territories of advanced socio-economic development will appear - "Abaza" and "Novotroitsk".
The relevant resolutions of the Government of the Russian Federation will come into force today, August 4.
The boundaries and types of economic activity of the TOR on the territory of the city of Abaza in the Republic of Khakassia are determined.
In the city, where there are 15,000 people, there will be a special legal regime of entrepreneurial activity, as well as a minimum amount of capital investments of residents, a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
It is expected that this will attract about 2.5 billion rubles of investment in the city, as well as create more than 600 new jobs.
The list of economic activities under which the TOR "Abaza" will operate a special legal regime of entrepreneurial activity, for example, includes crop production, animal husbandry, production of food products, soft drinks and clothing.
Already, the Government of the Republic has signed framework agreements on the implementation of 8 investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the dependence of the territory on the city-forming enterprise of LLC "Abakansky mine".
In January 2017, the authorities of the region reported that Khakassia fulfilled all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the creation of TOR.
The authorities of the Orenburg region did the same.
There, in the city of Novotroitsk, a territory of advanced socio-economic development will also be created.
This will diversify the economy of the monotown, reduce its dependence on the city-forming enterprise of JSC "Ural Steel", as well as create more than 2.3 thousand jobs and attract investments in the amount of more than 8 billion rubles.
The list of economic activities under which the new TOR will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurs includes, in particular, freshwater fish farming, the production of feed, medicines and medical materials.
Novotroitsk became the first of the monotowns of the Orenburg region to receive the status of TOR.
The territory of advanced development is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges, which is created to attract investment to improve the life of the population.
Among the benefits for residents of TOR can be distinguished the following: income tax in the amount of not more than 5% for the first five years, and not less than 10% for the next 5 years, social contributions in the amount of 7.6% for 10 years, the use of the free zone regime, preferential mode of connection to various infrastructure objects, as well as preferential rates on rent.

In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Russian singer called Manson a "scumbag" and "scumbag".
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
In addition, Loza believes that Manson for his words should be “put in the face”.
Recall that the American artist, known for his outrageous actions, rudely spoke about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that Manson's statement was commented on by domestic producer Joseph Prigogine.
