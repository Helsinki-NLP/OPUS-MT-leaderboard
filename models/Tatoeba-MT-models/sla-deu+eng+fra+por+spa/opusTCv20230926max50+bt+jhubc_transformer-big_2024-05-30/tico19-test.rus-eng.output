The fast-growing rate of cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the UK between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, thus confirming that, despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase the level of readiness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is the causative agent of the infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has come to be called coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available to date, about 80% of people with COVID-19 develop the disease in a mild form, i.e. in the form of an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, with the majority of patients recovering.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe form of the disease requiring hospitalization, and the remaining 6% takes a critical form when intensive care is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/EEA (EEA) country and in the UK and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and now the COVID-19 pandemic is developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria by which WHO determines the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on January 24, 2020, with all three returning from Wuhan, China’s Hubei province.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 infections were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded between December 31, 2019 and that date, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatalities, occurred in Italy alone.
Determination of the Cumulative Quantity and Cumulative Incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 a.m. the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country of the world, obtained from official sources such as the health ministries of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with data on Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, the truncated cumulative COVID-19 prevalence over 14 days was calculated taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 on March 15, 2020, compared to data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK
Trends in truncated cumulative COVID-19 incidence over the 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and the UK as a whole were consistent with those observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to rise around February 21, and on February 28, 2020, there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but there were similar trends in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK to the increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the same figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this data, the total number of cases already reported as of 8:00 on March 15 in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the different stages in different countries, the differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases and different rules for the selection of patients for testing for the presence of COVID-19, including " catch-up" testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were already as full as possible.
Currently, data on the admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available only for 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not presented).
However, such data should be systematically collected to complement current observation data on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to the results of a study conducted in 2010-2011, in Europe there is a significant variability in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The ECDC’s sixth update on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment presents scenarios for simulating the loading of health system resources with estimates of COVID-19-infected hospitalizations in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
Since cases are currently grouped into specific regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a specific territorial group, information on cases of infection and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to provide, where possible, by level 2 units of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for a long-term SARS-CoV-2 contact infection scenario and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which can be observed, for example, in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, it is of great importance to deter the spread of SARS-COV-2 has an operational, proactive and integrated approach followed by the transition from deterrence to minimization of consequences, because, given the predicted rapid increase in the number of diseases will be corrected in a way, if the decision-makers and hospitals will take action, it may simply not be enough time to respond with a reason.
The rapid risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) caused by SARS type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died so far in China and elsewhere, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Similar to the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger people, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid growth in the number of publications on the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing subject of research.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of the further course and prevention of this disease.
Although the answers to many questions are yet to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25 in 2020, was an unprecedented and memorable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after it due to the outbreak of a new viral infection.
Given the high degree of similarity with the Coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the co-morbid disease Coronavirus Infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread across the country, and then to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been detected, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy of society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), there have been more than 200 publications on COVID-19 in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report dated January 7, 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus isolated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-induced disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS), whose outbreak occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known at the moment about the prevention and forecasting of the course of the disease, as well as some other equally urgent issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not deadly to humans and mainly cause about 15% of common respiratory diseases.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively, which have caused many more outbreaks of diseases in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Fig. Fig. 1.1, the report on clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first received by the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it became known about the infection of health workers, which suggested the possibility of transmission of the virus from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and public transport was suspended.
On January 24, according to the first clinical trial of this disease, it was noted that 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak is a global public health emergency.
At the time of preparation of this report, the disease has spread throughout China and has already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and extent of the risk of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, according to the results of a multicenter clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, the following updated picture of the development of the epidemic was presented (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infection was susceptible to all age groups, but mostly affected people aged 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is higher in men (0.31/100,000) than in women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has been spread by clusters mainly in Hubei province and nearby regions.
On average, it took 5 (2-9) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to diagnosis.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
From the onset of symptoms to the onset of death, an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days passed.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected, coinciding with large-scale transportation on the eve of Chinese New Year celebrations.
The mortality rate among patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one strand of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to affect humans.
In the case of coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein of the shell spike process (S) binds to the cell receptors of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
In the cytoplasm, the genome of the viral RNA is released; after the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA together with the shell glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports of the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, the genome of which is 99.98% the same as 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease, in the market of seafood Huanan in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using translucent electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin slices of human respiratory epithelium.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less disease severity in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play a role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-size human enzyme ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence in recognising and infecting the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were sourced from bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through civet and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely bat coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which species became the intermediate host, thanks to which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the route of transmission also remains to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that snakes became carriers of the virus from bats to humans, in the process of which a homologous recombination in the S-protein occurred.
According to the results of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou have suggested that pangolins - long-tailed mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on the 99 percent genetic similarity between the SARS-2 pangolin coronavirus and the SARS-2 pangolin.
However, the 1% difference distributed between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating to 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorocontaining disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents can effectively block the activity of the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There is currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Typically, a virus that enters the host first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognition receptors (PCRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from the recovering patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an immune system hyperreaction leads to the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario, lead to multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect elderly people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, with a spread of 0 to 24 days.
The study, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases, found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with asymptomatic disease.
A 14-day quarantine is a common practice for people who have had contact with the virus or are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high fever, which may be the only manifestation or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as a dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
In some patients, a week after the onset of the disease, dyspnoea and (or) hypoxia were noted.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be checked for a virus in order to make an early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies in the pictures of the chest.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates of symptoms: 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation.
Similar results were obtained as a result of two recent studies of cases of infection in the family and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required artificial ventilation, a figure much higher than among COVID-19 patients, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are fever (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), shortness of breath (40–42%), diarrhea (20–25%) and sore throat (13–25%), and artificial ventilation is required in 14–20% of patients.
As of February 14, the COVID-19 death rate was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66.576.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Based on the results of an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) in the range of 5.71–7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only in the range of 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV by symptom manifestation, mortality rate and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the death rate in case of infection with the new virus is lower compared to the last two.
Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestation often occurs when infected within the same family or group of people, gathered together for any reason or found themselves together on any transport, for example, on a cruise ship.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or had contact with infected or sick people within the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, according to the data presented in the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, when discharged from the hospital, can become carriers of the virus again, and this is an alarming signal to the extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopenia with a leukocyte level < 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, including a leukocyte level < 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, as well as elevated asparagine aminotransferase and viraemia.
In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell sedimentation were observed.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, a degradation product of fibrin present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was steadily decreasing.
In most patients with COVID-19, chest X-rays revealed pathologies characterized by uneven dimming on both sides or dimming in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ARD).
With the development of ARI, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant violation of gas exchange.
Dysfunction of pneumocyte types I and II lowers the level of surfactant compounds and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst X-ray results often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocyte detachment, hyaline membrane formation and interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in lung patients who died from the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ARI and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19, the method of detection of RNA SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase) was used.
However, given the high level of false-negative results, which can accelerate the pace of development of the epidemic, from February 13, 2020 in China began to be diagnosed on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on PCR with reverse transcriptase).
The same was true for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine the data of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and results of radiographic examination.
On February 14, 2020, a team of specialists under the guidance of Mr. Feng Zhang (Feng Zhang) described a protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK technique, based on the CRISPR repetition, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows the detection of synthetic fragments of RNA of SARS-CoV-2 at a density of from 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10–18 mol/l to 10 <0xC3><0x97> 18 mol/l (in) of the SHER-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of the tests and the convenience of their conduct.
Due to the lack of experience in counteracting the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can generally only provide supportive therapy to COVID-19 patients while attempting to apply any therapeutic techniques that have been used or proposed in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immune suppressants, steroids, plasma recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
For treatment, it was proposed to use even plasma of recovered patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, and may also affect to a lesser extent other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, impaired functioning and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, to relieve symptoms and save lives, it is critical to maintain respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapulmonary circulation used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, it is essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2 to maintain water-salt balance, prevent and treat secondary infections and septic shock, and protect vital organ functions.
The cytokine storm is known to be a consequence of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release a huge number of free radicals, which become the main cause of the development of ARI and multi-organ failure.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients in severe condition, the suppression of immunity is of paramount importance.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as an interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other methods of treatment of cytokine storm based on immune suppression include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T-cells; blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of Janus kinase; use of blinatumomab, cytokine signals 4 suppressors, and inhibitors of cytokine signals.
To reduce the severity of the consequences of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immune suppressants.
However, steroids in high doses do not benefit in the treatment of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of compilation of this document, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola viruses and the Marburg virus.
Remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead has provided this drug formulation to China for paired studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, <0xCE><0xB1>-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and production of antibodies
Blood collection in patients cured of an infectious disease, for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease, or for the protection of a healthy population has been used for a very long time.
And in fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are in the immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual molecules of pathogens and specifically neutralize them.
Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples of a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, in order to propose the mass use of this method before the specific therapy, no verification and no explanations are required.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, some of the shortcomings associated with the use of plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given its toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma for the treatment of patients in critical condition requires a lot.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate the B-cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of active antibodies or conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical virus proteins.
So we can immediately move on to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for millennia to treat a variety of diseases.
However, its effectiveness largely depends on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have uncertain effects, as it seems difficult to isolate and test these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy for COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest proportion of recovered patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces of China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including in Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was most used for the treatment of only about 30% of patients with COVID-19.
However, this is a rather rough comparison, since the assessment should be made taking into account many other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatments based solely on Western medicine and combined treatments based on Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the timing of normalization of body temperature, elimination of symptoms and provision of medical care in a hospital were significantly less in patients for whom a combination of methods of Western and Chinese traditional medicine was used, than in patients who were treated only by Western methods.
Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients who began to worsen symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only with Western methods (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower (7.4% vs. 46.2%).
However, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely monitored studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in the techniques of traditional Chinese medicine, or their combination.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 generally experience a strong fear of acute and even deadly disease, and people locked into quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses have been reported, including chronic depression, heightened anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people’s anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and those who have contacted them, as well as to all other people who need it.
As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric care teams should be formed, clear information should be established with regular and accurate updates of information about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in disrupting the chain of transmission from carrier animals and infected humans to susceptible hosts, and are often used in addition to antiviral therapies used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work was carried out on the creation of vaccines based on S-protein, the purpose of which is to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In the course of animal studies, live attenuated vaccines against SARS viruses were developed.
However, before clinical trials begin, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when used in elderly patients, the model of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and since then no new cases have been reported.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus, originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions due to the preservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats, continue to occur.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements have been developed to combat MERS, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical challenge that requires solutions to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (an average of 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show the full picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a disease prognostic model to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the clinical trial data presented to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prediction of the course of the disease in COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years old, according to the aforementioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying illnesses and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not require intensive care (an average of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmias.
Cardiological events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and baseline diseases are closely related and can distort the results.
Laboratory abnormalities: The level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor for the course of the disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
It was also proposed to consider the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the prognosis for COVID-19.
In addition, an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase can also predict the result.
These enzymes are secreted in large quantities by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
The main clinical symptoms: to predict the results and complications of the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, should take into account the data of x-ray examination of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune suppressants widely used in infectious diseases as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, causing lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are needed for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, these drugs should be prescribed in low doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress amid the COVID-19 epidemic, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve stress in such patients and help them return to normal life, they must be provided with psychological consultations and long-term support.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet completed the incubation period can, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, which significantly complicates epidemiological control.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when patients were severely ill, with most cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.
Thus, today’s COVID-19 epidemic is far more serious than the SARS epidemic, and more difficult to control.
China is currently working hard to declare a general quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as extend the quarantine regime for almost the entire population, introduced in order to break the chain of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these measures are causing enormous harm to the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new patients detected is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of attenuation will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group, led by Ira Longini, put together a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A team of Canadian experts reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in smears from the nose and throat taken from patients recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently in place may have had an effect.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola should have affected up to a million people and caused the death of half a million patients.
But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to be controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, the infective ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which means that an oral-faecal mode of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been due to an infection in a hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; both surgical masks and N95 class respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow microdroplets of liquid from potentially infected people to fly in the air and settle on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95-class masks (series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions between 10 and 80 nm in size, they only allow 5% of virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm in size.
Since the particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, medical professionals in direct contact with patients must necessarily wear N95-class masks (Series No. 1860s), rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical professionals should wear a protective bathrobe adjusted to the figure to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95-class mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical professionals should also wear transparent face shields or closed type safety glasses.
All populations in affected or potentially endangered regions are urged to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant detergents, try not to leave the house while observing self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered a distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high degree of similarity to SARS-CoV reported on January 7, 2020, should have been an alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it acquired during the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, only after January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has low contagiosity and limited reproductive capacity when transmitted from person to person and that the prevention of spread and control of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement greatly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and missed a critical time when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal casualties.
China’s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since every word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor more closely and respond to unusual information coming from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) make more resolute and effective measures to deter a potential epidemic in the early stages of its development.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the previously unexplored coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has covered the whole of China and at the time of writing this document has spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV coronavirus and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of SARS, a COVID-19 outbreak has caused a relapse of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of epidemic containment and patient treatment.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and deaths among older people is also higher than among young people.
The mortality rate due to SARS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in asymptomatic disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and on a larger scale than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may be negative for conventional SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, treated patients may again show positive tests for the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Against the backdrop of such rapid advances in COVID-19 research, some important issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-like coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.
What animal became the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, for example, from bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission pathway, and the epidemiological situation may worsen at any moment.
Molecular-level simulations and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus infiltrate airway cells and trigger subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear as well as SARS, or will it relapse periodically like the flu?
These aspects are paramount, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but, whatever the cost, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normalcy.
Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause mild illnesses such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 once again drew attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmissibility but less pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.
A human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate carrier reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of carrier animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interactions of animals carrying coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of the coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origin and methods of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar RNA strand.
These viruses with the largest RNA-containing genome among viruses, containing from 26,000 to 32,000 nucleotides, got their name due to their form, which, when viewed under an electron microscope, resembles a corona.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins labeled nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spike protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronaviruses also encode a number of line-specific accessory proteins.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), with the type of beta-coronavirus comprising most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-coronaviruses.
For millennia, coronaviruses have consistently overcome interspecies barriers, and some have evolved into pathogens that are dangerous to humans.
Seven human coronaviruses are known to date.
These include human alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a comparatively higher number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARI) and exhibiting extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first strand of human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample extracted from the nasopharynx of patients who contracted a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the overall mortality rate was about 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
Discovered in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the disease of the current 2019 coronavirus infection epidemic (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 claimed more than 3,120 lives and the number of infected exceeded 91,000 people.
An alarm signal has been received and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonotic origin, their sources are bats, mice or pets.
Numerous data sets testify to the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to organisms to which the viruses have adapted well and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but show a wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
The study of the zoonotic mechanism of the origin of human coronaviruses will allow us to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecies transfer.
It may also prompt or speed up the search for a reservoir, an intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.
This review provides general information on the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but acquire a pathogenic character after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We are also analyzing the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first derived from a sample extracted from the nasopharynx of patients with colds, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides an informative and illustrative summary of the history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was derived from samples taken from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966; the virus later adapted to multiply in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough occurring in 10–20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of mammalian mice.
Clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are ubiquitous in the world and tend to be transmitted in winter in temperate latitudes.
Basically, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of illness.
According to the results of the study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common cold of a mild form.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity showed severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the “atypical pneumonia epidemic,” was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, with the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coronaviruses, being the cause of the disease.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths have been documented, and the disease has spread to many countries and continents.
Without taking into account overactive spreaders, it was estimated that each infected person could infect about two more people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the peak viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially had muscle pain, headaches, fever, malaise, and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory failure.
Common deviations of laboratory parameters from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, abnormalities in liver samples and an increased level of creatine kinase.
Patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells, and increased levels of macrophages.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can be infected, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open biopsy of a relative of the patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to study human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found to mainly affect young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is characterized by such manifestations as a runny nose, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old Dutch boy suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of diseases caused by it occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to outpatient pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory disease, has been detected worldwide.
All four of these human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation, entailing highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although incidents were and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example with the more virulent HCoV-NL63 subtype of China, which, according to recent reports, caused no serious infection.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to be effectively transmitted and retained in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but imported cases and spread through episodic secondary cases of close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-borne coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%) have been reported, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to humans.
Between mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, China’s Hubei province, which is now, looking back, linked to an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been dubbed “coronavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and beyond it - 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like the coronaviruses SARS and MERS, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly turn into acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic but has a greater transmission capacity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, indicating the ability of this virus to spread rapidly around the world.
A comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and duration of the disease caused by them.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly observed when infected with human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Third, in terms of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, interesting patterns are also noted, characteristic of both human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in feces samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after the transition through humans.
All four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it may be that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe illness in humans and people who have human coronaviruses that cause severe illness simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations counteracting carrier constraints.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to a person.
If it adapts well, its transmission among humans will be difficult to stop through quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four out-of-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing the common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reservoir animal.
The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to survive and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for cases of getting into susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four outpatient HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as out-of-hospital HCoV, at least at present.
But it is more pathogenic than out-of-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts fully to humans and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The progenitor virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the carrier reservoir constantly carries HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only recorded in an intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was recorded to humans, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of a booster carrier, allowing the virus to replicate rapidly and then pass it on to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can carry a dead end infection if it cannot withstand transmission within an intermediate carrier.
In contrast, HCoV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting and hunting animals (wild).
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that animal traders have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
The Himalayan civet (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first established carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civets in the markets, cases of SARS were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms and not entering the markets, in most cases SARS-CoV was not determined, which leads to the conclusion that Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate amplifying carrier, and not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that numerous small mammalian species can also serve as intermediate boosters.
They all seem to be dead end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
Subsequent searches for the natural carrier animal SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, which has been dubbed the HKU3 horseshoe-borne bat coronavirus (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) associated with atypical pneumonia, and which is present in Chinese horseshoe-borne bats.
These mice tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88–92% of the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that bats became carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in bats, but none of them, except for one, which designates WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, derived from a bat feces sample, has been shown to use ACE2 of bats, civet, and humans as a receptor for entry into the cell.
Curiously, the serums of recovering patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis assigned MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to the sequences of bat beta-coronaviruses detected in Europe and Africa.
Until now, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats is only 87%.
That is, bats may not be the direct carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-rooted camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal smears of camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms, but massive viral release.
It is noteworthy that infected camels isolated the virus not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus isolation in bats.
However, there are still questions as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome have had no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms and are plausibly related to human-to-human transmission or transmission through unknown channels, including unidentified animal species that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides is 96.2% the same as that of CoV RaTG13 in bats isolated from Asian horseshoe rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to attribute parental relationships to them.
That is, bats may not be a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
Presumably, the direct carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, which has been associated with many initial COVID-19 cases, indicating a likely case of transmission from the animal to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of threatened small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also carry a parent beta-coronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes is 85–92% consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with identity at the level of nucleotide sequences being about 90%.
They are clustered in two subline differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
On the contrary, RSDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
An earlier study of pangolin patients also reported the detection of viral contiges in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to produce a genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
The possibility that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in RCDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal advocates a recombination between pangolin beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
A final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been made.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains are found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in the North American tricolor sucker, has been reported to show close kinship to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that camels could be its intermediate carrier.
For clarity, current knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis gave evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoV in the history.
When interspecies transmission of HCoV-OC43 occurred around 1890 and humans became infected from pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alphacoronaviruses of bats, closely related to HCoV-229E, have been found.
Between them is alphacoronavirus alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could have been in contact with bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses, related to HCoV-229E, in bats are diverse and non-pathogenic, while alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alphacoronavirus of alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas may have acquired the HCoV-229E-related alphacoronavirus from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alphacoronaviruses could serve as a gene pool for the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats “ideal spreaders.”
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single-hound camels decades ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate carrier to a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its episodic transmission to humans is accidental, and the human remains a dead end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be dead end carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is necessary to confirm or exclude several possibilities of interspecies transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.
First, bats may be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats thanks to the coal mining or carcass cutting of these animals.
Secondly, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifying carriers to which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently fallen.
People become infected with the virus by cutting carcasses and eating wild animal meat.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of carrier animals, three major factors on the part of viruses also contributed to the crossing of interspecies barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered “moderately high” with an average replacement rate of approximately 10–4 substitutions per year per site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to the new hosts.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high rate of mutation and weakening or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir inhibits the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 that needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of mutations of coronaviruses is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to a person.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-humped camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>-end of the genome.
Third, due to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrixes during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, the threads often switch.
High-homology full-size and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-carrier interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
In this article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transfer events, the recombination of SARS-CoV is given.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to mutations on the S-protein RSD.
In general, the RSD of the S protein of the coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier antibody response intensively selects it.
RSD in SARS-CoV is an amino acid, from the 318th to the 510th, on the S1 fragment, which binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2), as well as its receptors, to introduce the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV RSD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoons, making interspecies transmission of the virus possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in RSD, which are different from human and civet viral strains, with 4 of them in the receptor-binding motif for interacting with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets have mutations K479N and S487T in the RSD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the thorny protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of protein S leads to the fact that the binding affinity of protein S to human ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity for this relationship is 10 to 20 times higher than between human AFP2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other receptors are required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to another segment of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans following interspecies transmission from host animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of dependence and carrier constraint.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission of HCoV viruses, it is necessary to usurp the factors of dependence and subordinate the factors of restriction of carriers.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can be obtained by impartial full-genome screening of dependence and carrier restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The variety of bat coronaviruses creates ample opportunities for new HCoVs to emerge.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important stages in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of the SARS-CoV coronavirus was found.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates carrier change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with alpha- and gamma-coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localizations have also been determined in nonstructural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, epidemic MERS-CoV was shown to have undergone recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-rooted camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs have been recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely as a result of getting rid of the virus from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the immune system of the carrier.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to binucleotide deletion.
While the intact open-frame ORF4 reading can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alphacoronavirus exhibits a single-nucleotide insertion, leading to a frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the pressure of selection on their reservoir carriers.
When bats were infected with coronaviruses, mild symptoms or their absence were recorded, indicating mutual adaptation between the coronaviruses and bats.
It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the apregulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the molecules of the main class I histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, high levels of active oxygen, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, simultaneously affecting the reading of exoribonucleases, thus creating a selection pressure for the generation of virus strains, which, when penetrated into a new carrier, are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the carrier.
So it’s no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last twenty years.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They replicate confidently without causing a strong immune response in the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
Conversely, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with coronavirus replication.
The same non-binding immune response strategy may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, taking type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, bats impaired the activation of NLRP3-inflammatoryoma.
Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammatoryoma by MCC950 may prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose.
While bat beta-coronavirus has been found whose nucleotide homology is 95% SARS-CoV, there is also bat coronavirus whose nucleotide homology is 96% SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals on the market have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have not been directly identified.
Pangolin beta-coronaviruses, strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, have been found, suggesting that pangolins may have served as an intermediate carrier or that fragments of pangolin beta-coronavirus genes may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronaviruses have garnered widespread attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV reservoir animals in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civets in markets, the closure of game markets and the destruction of civets on them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of various lines of pangolin beta-coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed to prevent zoonotic transmission from food markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how this may occur, remains a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-rooted camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as has been done in China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infectious control measures.
Because we can’t eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that cause outbreaks of the disease.
Various zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the world.
In particular, bat coronaviruses are extremely diverse with zoonotic potential.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more deadly to humans.
To reduce the number of unnecessary contacts between humans and animals, it is necessary to abandon the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China.
After the rigorous testing of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until there is a possibility of conquering new territories.
Although many of the properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, if you teach people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife species.
For a better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, constant epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
In the puzzle of zoonotic origin SARS-CoV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First, if bats passed the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate carrier, then it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its progenitor viruses will be identified in their natural hosts.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of diagnostic criteria for ‘suspected cases’ and ‘confirmed cases’ of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our group published a brief guide to diagnosing and treating a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides insights into our experience and validated recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has gradually increased based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the “Covid-19 Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines” (Seventh Version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially called coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called “severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a brief reference guide and published it online on the Military Medical Research website on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted a lot of attention.
We note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has gradually increased based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven editions of the document “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19”, published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with the content of some of its provisions has changed significantly.
Recently, a paper prepared by Zhou (Zhou) with co-authors provided comments on our recommendations. They contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on the worldwide pandemic.
We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines (trial seventh version) and the results of ongoing research, and their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (March 3, 2020), in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming a case of a suspected disease, it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movements or residences in the city of Wuhan and its surroundings or in other settlements where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded within 14 days before the manifestation of symptoms; (2) history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test on the basis of nucleic acids); (3) history of contacts with patients with high levels of COV-19.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count is normal or decreased with reduced lymphocyte count at an early stage of symptoms.
Diagnosis for a confirmed case of the disease should be based on the case of a suspected disease with a change in the fags of the disease with the presence of one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genome sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) the serotest results are positive.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of this document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) issues; then in the seventh edition, the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for the optimal kit for detecting nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of disease.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need to exercise caution when treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies individuals without clinical symptoms as a “low-risk” group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that readers monitor and strictly follow the latest recommendations that are given in those countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh Reports Five New COVID-19 Deaths – Daily Maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths per day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were reported, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over the age of 60, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
An employee of the clinic told the local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwaiti Maetri Clinic.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport operations had been suspended since March 26 and were due to resume on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods – medicines, fuel and food – was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, the three men had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has reached one million cases worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people have died from COVID-19.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first case of infection and Zambia recorded the first case of death from the coronavirus.
North Korea has claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries in which no cases of coronavirus infection were recorded.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 CET (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there have been more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection, of which at least 5,900 have been fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths due to coronavirus infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the regime of self-isolation of citizens of the city until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote: 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while previously the curfew lasted only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state's domestic self-isolation regime was extended by order until May 1.
Stores in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased at a time in all stores in the country, to two and one packages, respectively.
ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions were reported in ads at the cash registers, as well as on the network's Facebook page.
Citizens have reportedly started making emergency reserves due to fears that COVID-19 could result in the introduction of a regime of general self-isolation.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5 respectively, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this number to 4 packs.
In a March 8 press release, Coles said that with the introduction of the four-pack cap, “in many stores, toilet paper is still being sold out too quickly – one delivery in an hour,” and called such demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI in a Facebook post published on Tuesday called the trend “unexpected.”
According to Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited this amount to two packages.
To fill the deficit, Coles began ordering larger lots from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional lots, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale promotion on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers are trying to replenish stocks, but this is hampered by local authorities’ restrictions on truck timetables.
He expects an increase in the cost of products, as suppliers try to meet demand, but at the same time there are less and less profitable offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to stock depletion, some stores could not hold stocks on Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said shops replenish stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the number of stocks is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of shortage of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and goods like toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic so much,” says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap announced it was running out of supplies.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a Kleenex toilet paper company and Solaris Paper, which also produces Sorbent-branded goods, reported that they are working around the clock to provide enough goods.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne fell due to the lack of buyers on the Labor Day holiday week, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first auctioneers.
The Thursday issue of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to be cut out and used as toilet paper.
According to an ABC Australia report dated March 3, stores were initially reluctant to impose limits on the number of items they purchased, saying they had no plans to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, garments, handwashing products and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, it was noticed on Sunday evening that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that governments need to take action to:
“All countries together are still in a position to influence the course of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are engaged in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation, monitoring of cases of the disease, as well as the mobilization of their citizens,” explained WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of prevalence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than influenza has been traced from its onset to its continuous global spread.”
Mr. Ghebreyesus expressed a similar point of view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We’ve also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance, and then assigned it a new status – a pandemic.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “This is just the beginning, it’s going to get worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, with more than 4,600 people dying.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on January 30, 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, killing approximately 97,000 people.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is 4%, while in the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people who suspect their infection.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls and the closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages of goods, exacerbated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities were closed nationwide or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.
Disinformation about the virus began to spread on the Internet, there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people resembling them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where there were significant cases of spread of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in the number of trips and the closure of heavy industry, the level of air pollution and carbon emissions has decreased.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Cases of infection were mainly related to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood, so the virus is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that bears great resemblance to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, the publication of the South China branch of the Morning Post newspaper, the information of which has not been verified, suggested that the first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China decreased, but the number of new cases in China and the number of new cases in Iran increased unexpectedly.
The number of cases of the disease can be significantly underestimated, in particular, due to the many cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Wallans estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before effective group immunity was established in the country ' s population.
The statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted an official policy not to test for only minor symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that 86% of COVID-19 cases were not detected in China before January 23, and that such unregistered patients were the source of infection for 79% of reported cases.
Statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of actual cases in Italy significantly exceeded the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive infection number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
In a study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is assumed that this figure could be 5.7.
The majority of COVID-19 patients recover safely.
In other more complicated cases, the time from onset of symptoms to death ranged from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of the deaths had comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official data on COVID-19 pandemic deaths usually include data on deaths of patients with positive COVID testing performed according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account deceased people who have not been tested – for example, in case of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data on Italy indicates that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures by 4-5 times.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits, “We know [the claimed death toll] is lower than actual.” His words are corroborated by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S. This kind of accounting with incomplete data is often found in pandemics such as the January 2009 swine flu epidemic of H1N1. The first confirmed death was recorded in the 9th.
The first death outside mainland China was reported on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside Asia – in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and time of spread of the disease; they are also affected by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the onset of the disease outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health. The mortality / morbidity ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases of infection during a given interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The data varies from region to region.
In China, the mortality to morbidity ratio has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms on January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms on February 1, 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of mortality due to disease (CFR) – the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the percentage of mortality due to infection (IFR), which reflects
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall death rate from the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 percent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of Germany’s first random COVID-19 testing, as well as a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO says the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash are not identifiable and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to come out onto the plateau and then, when the number of available carriers of the disease runs out, they begin to fade.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.”
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, says “it could all be over by June” if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on containment measures.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will circulate perhaps within a year or two."
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is created (possibly 18 months or more),” physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a fellow at Vanderbilt University, said: “I don’t think this coronavirus will ever go away for good, because it’s so easily transmitted,” and that it “could turn into a seasonal disease, flaring up every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people can carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum formation in the respiratory tract (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, pain in muscles and joints, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhaging, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO claims that a person gets sick in a serious form with the development of respiratory problems every six
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as difficulty breathing, constant pain or a feeling of drowsiness in the chest, a sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty waking up and bluishness of the face or lips. In the presence of these symptoms, the patient should immediately seek medical help. More
In some infected people, the disease can be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but at the same time the results of tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing people in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed, under strict monitoring and examination for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic course of the disease ranges from a few units to 44% of all cases.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. There is no complete clarity on the symptom of olfactory loss: according to initial estimates, the percentage of COVID-19 patients who developed this symptom was initially 30%, and then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease has spread are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air along with a cough, sneeze or during a conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, with an open cough, drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus may also be transmitted through small droplets ejected into the air during a conversation that are able to remain in the air for longer. Respiratory droplets can also form during exhalation, including during a conversation, although the virus is not usually carried through the air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the tests tested positive three days before the onset of symptoms, and this indicates the possibility of transmission of the virus before severe symptoms appear.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not clear how easily the virus spreads, it is known that one person usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus is able to live up to three days, on a cardboard surface - for one day, and on copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, just as they do after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases reported in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a great similarity to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (B cell line) together with two other bat virus strains.
At the whole genomic level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin viruses and humans.
A holistic genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92%) exists between the coronavirus pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Virus infection can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should ultimately be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis with reverse transcription (PT-PCR) of the infected secretion or computed tomography.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19.”
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is carried out.
It can be performed on breathing tests and blood samples.
Results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to a few days.
Usually a smear from the nasopharynx is used for the test, although a smear from the yawn can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them were accurate enough to be approved for ubiquitous use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic features of imaging symptoms on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral clouding on the type of frosted glass and the absence of pleural effusions.
An international database of confirmed cases of infection is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
Due to the similarity with other infections, such as adenovirus, in the identification of COVID-19, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
A large study in China compared chest CT and PCR results and found that although images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be decoded faster; in addition, they are more sensitive, and therefore this method of diagnosis can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to diagnose the virus using X-rays and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using coughing or sneezing wipes that should be thrown away immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in crowded places.
In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance yourself from people. Many governments recommend refraining from any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has been able to spread to most regions of the world.
This means that the virus spreads among the population, some members of which do not know where and how they were infected. Healthcare professionals caring for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions as well as precautions when in contact with other people and eye protection products. Keeping track of contacts is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent it.
The use by governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have issued statements demanding that this type of surveillance of people be limited.
Various mobile applications were developed and offered for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on developing solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data – for example, recording the user’s proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, they are notified accordingly. There are also baseless versions of how to prevent infection – for example, rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
At the moment, there is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on its creation.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to wash hands.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating, after snoring, coughing, or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60%.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected by a number of solutions (on the surface of stainless steel disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) with a content of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or daycare facility, all spaces of such premises, including offices, toilets, public areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or sneezing, cover the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or a napkin and immediately throw away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of a mask can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that are dispersed in the air when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Using a medical mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their face, and touching their face with dirty hands is the main way to get infected.” Masks are also recommended for those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of a mask does reduce the number of facial touches.
Several countries have started calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC, USA, recommends wearing non-medical face masks. China separately emphasized the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand are urging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are forbidden to go outside without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered all grocery store visitors to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government also appealed to citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, where ten million medical masks have been produced every day since mid-March, was ordered to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and long-distance buses.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask when going outside; residents who could not purchase masks were advised to sew them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments in regions, particularly those severely affected by the outbreak, are now prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people that can gather in one place, according to the recommendation of U.S. government authorities and health organizations, was quickly reduced from 250 people (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned social gatherings in groups of more than two people. Elderly people and people suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious way. The CDC recommends them to stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of the disease in the region.
The use of the term “social distancing” has been understood in such a way that people should subject themselves to complete social isolation, instead of staying in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during a pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended to have sex only with your regular partners with whom you live and in whom you are sure that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health institutions have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas quarantine themselves.
Persons in high-risk groups were ordered to the strictest quarantine.
Individuals who may have been in contact with COVID-19 infected, or have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic, were advised to quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Outbreak control strategies include curbing, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The containment of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is aimed at tracking and isolating the infected, as well as other measures of infection control and vaccination with the aim of stopping the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health systems and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage an infectious disease outbreak is aimed at reducing the epidemic peak known as epidemic curve alignment.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include preventive measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; social measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of mass events; community involvement in assisting in the implementation of such measures and participating in them; and environmental measures such as the
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as a system for alerting the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to infected individuals in self-isolation and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, increased production of medical masks and fined for the accumulation of excess stocks of medicines. Modeling in the UK and the USA showed that there are serious problems with respect to mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
Optimal policies to mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can reduce the peak load on the health system by 2/3, and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may prove to be the preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier), otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to contain the pandemic has social and economic costs.
Antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19 do not exist at the moment, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking enough fluids, and rest can help ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid administration, and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and home remedies” could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO sees increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a major response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to facilitate the reallocation of resources at several levels, including the focus of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the abolition of non-urgent treatments and training opportunities, as well as, where possible, the detection of viruses and the isolation of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection could have occurred – the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Over the course of the month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the wholesale market of Huan'an seafood, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus has penetrated the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of mass pneumonia was reported in the clinic of Hubei province for this case of December pneumonia of unknown origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan City Central Clinic warned their colleagues of a “coronavirus similar to SARS.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for causing panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation and major railway hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, by January 20, 2020, symptoms of the disease had already appeared in 6,174 people. As of March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed infections in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million infections were recorded worldwide, more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have reported at least one case.
Due to the pandemic, many European Schengen countries have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses have included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay at home, mandatory shelter at home, or isolation), as well as curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were on some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation in the Philippines, and about 59 million people are in isolation in Africa.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure increased to 2.6 billion people - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the validity of the information has not been verified, this date is November 17.
On December 26, Zhang Jixian, MD, was working on a case of a massive pneumonia of an unknown type, which her clinic notified the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan City on December 27.
The initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, revealed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a corresponding public notice.
The WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for the “spread of rumors” about the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of the newly discovered virus’ ability to be transmitted from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later dubbed a “people’s war” by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping.
Events of the "largest quarantine in the history of mankind" began to unfold, and on January 23, a sanitary cordon and a ban on entry into Wuhan and back were announced, later this measure spread to a total of 15 cities of Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of personal transportation is prohibited in the city.
In many places, Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital was built, Leishenshan, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also converted 14 other institutions in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote mode of operation.
Travel restrictions have been introduced in Hubei Province and beyond.
The public transport schedule was changed, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, a regime of control over the movement of citizens was introduced, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restrictions on movement in the open air. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, in Beijing, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, there was only one case of transmission within the country in mainland China that occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said the spread of domestically transmitted cases had largely been halted and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubei, except Wuhan, were lifted, this happened two months after the closure of the province for quarantine. On March 26, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that from March 28, entry for persons with a visa or residence permit will be suspended. The exact dates for the cancellation of this order were not named.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government called on enterprises and factories to resume operations and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On April 4, at 10:00, a national three-minute “minute of silence” was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, announced by the State Council of the country and coincided with the Quinmin holiday.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea from China on January 20, 2020.
On February 20, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of the disease, due in large part to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchonji gathered in Daegu.
Shinchongji's followers arrived in Daegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, out of 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13%) reported having symptoms of the disease. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest level of anxiety.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, and on 29 February this figure rose to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed the presence of the virus in three soldiers.
The outbreak affected the number of trips, therefore, the flight schedule of airlines was changed. South Korea has deployed a program to screen the population for the presence of the virus, track contacts and organize quarantine measures for contacts. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
The screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile app by all those coming from abroad, a general virus testing, the results of which were ready the next day, as well as an expansion of testing capabilities, allowing up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean program is considered successful in combating the outbreak, despite the fact that entire cities were not isolated there. Initially, South Korean society was divided due to the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for what they believed was an inadequate government response to the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in one day over four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed in a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on April 1, 121 countries applied to South Korea for help in testing for the virus.
On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures imposed by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020, that the government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to restrict long-distance travel, but intensive travel between cities before the Persian New Year continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Amid allegations of cover-up of the scale of the outbreak in Iran, more than a dozen countries linked their cases to Iran by February 28, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there may be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
Iran’s parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iran’s prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as to temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day — the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
As of March 23, there were 50 new cases of coronavirus in Iran every hour and one new death from the coronavirus every 10 minutes.
According to the WHO, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions against Iran could affect the country’s financial capabilities in terms of protection against the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for easing economic sanctions against countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had reached the territory of Italy, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, made in Rome.
The number of cases increased rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered. It all began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law on containment of the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “Entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as Italy had already recorded the deaths of 100 people.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were scheduled to take place behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses except for supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for setting the priority of medical care for patients, which may have to be used.
On March 19, Italy overtook China in terms of coronavirus deaths, ranking first in the world after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On March 22, it became known that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery cases, with most of these cases concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report noted that this high death rate in Italy could be due to a combination of two factors - a large number of elderly citizens of this country and the lack of opportunity to examine everyone who is currently ill with the coronavirus.
The United Kingdom has responded to the virus with the most calm of all affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not oblige citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the government was criticized for not responding quickly and seriously to the dangers in the country's population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all non-essential travel and social contacts should be refrained, urging people to work from home as much as possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment establishments, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of wages, but no more than <0xC2><0xA3> 2,500 per month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister only banned the cases of people and more than announced stricter measures on social distancing.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were introduced with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of crowds.
Most businesses have been ordered to close, with the exception of businesses that provide “the public’s livelihoods,” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, convenience stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, in the Pacific northwestern state of Washington, a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15 was confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in the country.
On January 29, the Task Force on Coronavirus Control was established in the White House.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government’s leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States was not started immediately, and as a result, the true scale of the outbreak during this period was hidden.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits released by the federal government in February, the lack until the end of February of permission from the federal government to use non-state test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done on the prescription of the attending physician).
The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States as of February 27.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted by March 13.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: “Many patients, even in the presence of symptoms and appointment of a doctor, waited their turn for hours or days for tests.” After the first case of death from the coronavirus in the United States was reported on February 29 from Washington State, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which was also soon declared by other states.
On March 3, Seattle schools were cancelled and by mid-March, schools were closed across the country. On March 6, 2020, a team of epidemiologists at Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the forecasts of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed into law the Additional Appropriations Act on Preparedness and Response to the Coronavirus, which provided federal authorities with $8.3 billion in emergency assistance to respond to the outbreak.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on employees, cancelled conferences, and encouraged employees to work from home.
Sports events and seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, except for the UK, for 30 days starting March 13.
The next day, he extended the restrictions to include the UK and Ireland.
On March 13, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, which made it possible to use federal funds to combat the crisis.
Starting on March 15, many companies began to close or cut their hours of work across the U.S., helping to fight the spread of the virus.

On March 25, the governor said social distancing was likely an effective measure, as estimates of doubling the number of cases dropped from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, 32,308 cases had been reported in New York and 672 people had died. It was reported that more confirmed cases of coronavirus infection had been reported in the United States on 26 March than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States of America, with 12,841 deaths.

On April 3, there were 884 deaths from the coronavirus in the U.S. within 24 hours.
In the state of New York, on April 3, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 people. The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring information that is publicly available, monitoring through the office of Vice President Mike Pence public statements and publications of health officials and scientists related to the virus.
In general, the views of supporters of President Trump on how successfully he manages to cope with the crisis are divided.
Some officials and observers have criticized the U.S. dependence on imports of essential materials, including essentials, from China.
In mid-January 2020, an analysis of air travel patterns was published in the journal Travel Medicine, which was used to map and predict patterns of disease spread.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was named the least prepared for the outbreak of the disease, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. On February 7, Australia adopted its plan of action for emergencies related to the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is said that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay special attention to border controls and communications in a threat situation.
On March 21, a biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.
Thanks to effective quarantine measures in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights of their home countries, to which the Chinese authorities have given their permission.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.

On February 21, the plane with 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On March 14, a South African Airways plane chartered by the South African government took off with 112 South African citizens on board.
A medical examination of the passengers was carried out before the flight, and four South Africans who had signs of the coronavirus were left in China to reduce the risk.
Only South Africans with negative tests for the coronavirus were evacuated.
The analyses were taken from all South African citizens, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and they were all kept under observation as a precautionary measure and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.

Humanitarian relief organization Direct Relief together with FedEx and FedEx also sent medical aid by plane to the Wuhan Medical Clinic by January 30.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to WHO to fund the development of a vaccine and the treatment of the coronavirus, as well as to protect the population of “African and South Asian risk groups” from the threat of the virus.
Interaksyon reported that on February 6, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would send $2.26 million in aid to China.
Japan also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment there, Russia - more than 13 tons of medicines, Malaysia announced the donation of 18 million medical gloves, Germany sent various medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States also donated 17.8 tons of medicines to other countries, the United States also sent financial assistance to China, and also promised to allocate $ 100 million.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organization to distribute to its member states.
He later also sent 5,000 kits for testing, 100,000 medical masks, and 5 IVLs to Panama.
Ma also donated medicines to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have expressed concerns about medical masks and kits for testing Chinese production.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus testing kits that provide accuracy of only 30%, and the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were supposed to have been made in China but later turned out to come from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency relief operations to developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of infection.
WHO noted clear differences between the situation with the outbreak of atypical pneumonia, which took place in 2002-2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy, which allegedly prevented the prevention of the disease and containment of its spread, and the current crisis, when the central government "revealed" the situation.
On January 23, 2009, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a ban on transportation in Wuhan, the WHO representative Goden Galea noted that, although "this measure was definitely not recommended by the WHO", it was also "a very important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the most prevalent places in China", and called it "an unprecedented in the history of public health".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC announcement was driven by “the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that unduly hinder international movements and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement.”
On 5 February, WHO asked the global community for $675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, announcing the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached these countries.”
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest link”, and called on the international community “to make a choice: to invest today or pay in the future”. At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease – COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem.”
As a result, a UN Crisis Management Team was created to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO says, will allow “focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to tackle the outbreak in a broader social and economic sense.”
On February 14, WHO and China initiated a joint ad hoc panel that would provide the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the situation within the country and assessing the "severity of the disease and its contagiousness", organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as visits to the countries to assess the "effectiveness of the response measures at the level of the provinces and districts", should be called "more than in February".
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the likelihood of global spread of the coronavirus would be increased from “high” to “very high” – the highest degree of readiness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, warned in a statement: “This is a test for every government on the planet to be prepared for the realities: it’s time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared,” and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid “the worst case scenario.”
Ryan also stated that the current data does not serve as a basis for declaring a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that declaring a pandemic would mean that “we essentially recognize the fact that every person on the planet will be at risk of contracting this virus.”
On March 11, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO said that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction in relation to the problem.” WHO has been severely criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the concept of pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the situation, a petition was filed with WHO Director-General Tedros Adanoma to resign, which had been signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to be subjected to life-saving measures, and that the Government was responsible for organising such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of state support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide feedback and recommendations.
The digital node provides information on country policy trackers to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for its actions to fight the pandemic that started in China’s Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level leaders of the Communist Party of China (CCP) have been fired for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these dismissals have demonstrated dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, disagreed with a previous statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but sided with a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has dubbed the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus”, saying that “China’s censorship only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement in turn has been criticized by some commentators who argue that the U.S. administration is not spreading the disease.
The Daily Beast was given access to a U.S. government telegram that contained a communications strategy trick apparently devised by the National Security Council, with such a reference to strategy: “It’s all about China.
We are asked to disseminate this information by any means possible, including press conferences and television appearances.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said China’s efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of a “propaganda push” to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the presence of “a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through PR and the so-called policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is persistently promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States.”
China also urged the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to some, sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba has been banned due to U.S. sanctions imposed on April 3.
U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid destined for other countries to their own country.
Medical masks have also been the subject of controversy among other countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IVLs intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus-covered Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said that “only China reacted bilaterally.
This is not a sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian military paramedics, specialized disinfection transport and other medical equipment to be sent to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous “high-level political source” as saying that 80% of Russian aid was “useless or of little use to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “By offering assistance to our American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to provide retaliatory assistance if necessary.”
NATO’s Defender 2020 military exercises, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States – NATO’s largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War – will be held in a shortened format.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson would have criticized the political exercise Defender 2020”: “In the crisis situation that has developed today in the field of public health, the conduct of these exercises endangers not only the lives of the US military and many European participating countries, but also the lives of residents of countries where such events should be held. The government of Iran has also suffered severely from the virus.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, appealed to world health leaders for help, informing that his country is experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to the US sanctions imposed against Iran. The epidemic has generated calls for the United States to be funded by children, to adopt social policies that are common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of health.
Politicians expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks in specially designated places by the government.
South Korean society was initially divided because of the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the president ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon ' s impeachment for what they believed was an inadequate government response to the outbreak, and the pandemic has forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this step will allow Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orban the indefinite right to govern by decree, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been cited as the cause of several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in panic conditions and disruptions in production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in suppliers.
Panic shopping also took place in several settlements; this led to a situation where essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
This spike has led to a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the supply of medical products for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO has warned that health workers will be under attack for this reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, buyers of the daigou system have a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and were subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as high demand for food, acute food shortages were avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products have been successful in avoiding the acute food shortages expected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production has a small scale, has not experienced significant declines, but, according to industry representatives, agricultural prices may rise.
The shelves of the grocery stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure full nutrition of the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to keep food stocks in case of emergencies exist in Italy.
The damage done to the global economy has affected China: according to media data dated March 16, China’s economy suffered heavily in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to control the spread of the virus, as a result of which retail sales fell by 20.5 percent.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub; therefore, the virus outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
According to Agatha Demaray, an employee of the Economist Intelligence Unit, the volatility in the markets will remain until there is a clearer picture of the potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could outweigh the impact of the 2002-2004 atypical pneumonia epidemic.
According to one estimate by an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began taking “urgent measures” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to a fall in demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones index for industrial companies, showed the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indexes showed more than a 10 percent drop.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Shares fell again due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are responding faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and governments’ recommendations not to undertake any trips.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of large-scale events, including annual New Year's festivals; private companies have also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's events were cancelled and tourist attractions were closed to prevent crowds; for example, the Forbidden City was closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs were cancelled.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities extended the New Year’s holidays until February 10, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and canceling the New Year celebrations. The retail sector has suffered globally: store opening hours have been reduced and some stores have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50-60%.
As a result, in March, the attendance of shopping centers fell by 33-43% compared to February.
Operators of shopping centers around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improving sanitation, installing equipment to check the temperature of visitors and canceling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14–22 million more people beyond the poverty line than it would have been in a similar situation, but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China’s 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their country’s provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the government for help.
According to estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in March, in the United States, the coronavirus outbreak could deprive 47 million people of jobs, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Self-isolation measures introduced in India will also leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers out of work in the meantime. The number of workers in the country is estimated to have increased from 10,000 to 4%.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany have transferred their employees to a government-subsidized reduced work schedule - part-time.
The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and the UK.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have sought to support their (often state-funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting artists.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed worldwide indefinitely, or access to them was limited to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In return, active efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also failed. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the events of Holy Week in Rome, which are held on the last week of the Christian penitential period – Lent.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while heads of some churches offer outdoor services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome has closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations have also abolished worship and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and courtyards.
Iran’s health ministry announced Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak had been cancelled, and shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia has banned foreign pilgrims and its own residents from accessing the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also disrupted plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "delayed beyond 2020, but no later than summer 2021." Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world have either been closed, and poker tournaments have either been rescheduled, streamed, and broadcasted live.
This has led to many players switching to online mode and many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, also cancelled all of their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organizing live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in the creative professions to continue performing, releasing or publishing their works.
There are a lot of online memes about the coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth out the anxious moods characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the onset of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as against the populations of hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Information reports for February (when most cases of infection were still confined to China) recorded racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retribution for something.
Some African countries have also seen a rise in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Citizens of China, as well as those who live in the affected areas, were supported both offline and online.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular, in Italy, the first country in Europe, faced with a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as China, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea are banned in the country in the aim of their citizens at an early stage, signed a petition
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDontComeToJapan) held a leading position on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report rising levels of racism and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus”; critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to Novy Sanzhary.
Students coming from northeastern India bordering China and studying in major cities in India have reported cases of harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party State Unit in West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “so God took revenge on them.”
Later, these statements received condemnation from the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them “misleading”. In China, due to the pandemic, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents re-erupted: foreigners were called “foreign garbage” and objects to be “recycled”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles on the coronavirus outbreak publicly available.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on preprint publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for Respiratory Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and intended only for the detection of RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to be treated in a hospital or who were absent at all.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By March 23, no country had been able to test more than 3% of its population, and the number of tests carried out in different countries was highly controversial.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
Using real-time polymerase reverse transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on samples from the respiratory tract obtained by various methods, including a smear from the nasopharynx or sputum sample.
Results are usually available over a period of a few hours to two days.
The OT-PCR test performed on smears taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, continuing, however, to multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, as an alternative, material from the lower respiratory tract can be taken using a suction catheter, or expectorant products (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charité Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-level PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the “E” gene common to all beta-coronaviruses of the public time.The CR-DiaLV19 is the public time and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the approval of the National Medicines Administration of China for the emergency use of the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the ReDC (C) is the organization of the ReDC (C)
One in three genetic tests from older versions of test kits produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using the two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of the emergency application authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been claimed; sampling and processing of analyses must be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology “VECTOR”.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use the test, which can be carried out over 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Application Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA issued a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives EUA from the FDA for a test duration of about 45 minutes.
The FDA has also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can reveal positive results in just five minutes, and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S., and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is currently developing a test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and there is hope for results in 15-20 minutes, similar to an express flu test.
A March 2020 review of specialized literature concluded that “breast X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms appear.”
Typical signs detected during CT include bilateral polygonal subpleural focuses of the seal type "frosted glass" with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of bulge bridge and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19”. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends using the PCR method for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and for the purpose of population monitoring. Tests can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnostics (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the production speed of each such system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used in CLT, although serial samples can also be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncture of the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, a blood sampling stage is not required for sampling. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency use authorization test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies that have the ability to fight the virus in blood samples.
Testing performance is several hundred samples over several hours and, therefore, this method works much faster than a conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody kits it had purchased were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with a suspected virus to stay at home: “emergency department staff give the patient a sample test tube”, the patient spits into it, gives back and after some time receives the test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for patients with suspected cases at home.
Express testing centers helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On March 2, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany stated that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and a week earlier they could only do 10,700 tests per week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s total test performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct rapid testing in several large cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of the calendar week of 12/2020 on SARS-CoV-2, a total of 64 tests were taken in the laboratory, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive. The researchers of the Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of the samples.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Wang Jiang and completed in just 5 days; simulations showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and accordingly, the cost of quarantine would also have been twice as high.
Following the opening of the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened – a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total throughput was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplexed Origami Assays were released, which can test up to 1,122 COVID19 patient assays using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for the use of robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to lack and insufficient reagents, it became problematic to conduct mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
As a result, some authors turned to test sample processing protocols that involve heating samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes with the aim of releasing RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the volume of coronavirus testing conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita is currently being tested, surpassing that of any other country, and soon the majority of the population will protest.
This was due to the ability to conduct rapid testing, along with the acquisition of Group 42 and BGI mass population testing laboratories (created on the basis of their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world’s first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside China.
Various testing options targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the production of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; a protocol developed by the sanitary and epidemiological centers of the United States was unavailable until January 28, leading to a lack of test kits in the US. At the very beginning of the outbreak, there were problems with the reliability of test kits in China and the US, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide a sufficient number of health-recommended kits in the region.
But in South Korea, according to experts, the wide availability of testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing, which arose due to the rapid spread of the virus, many US private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overloaded, and stocks of materials for smears and chemical reagents were quickly drained.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by the CDC had “deficiencies” and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private test development. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results could be an unsuccessful sampling or improper use of the kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would recall kits yielding inaccurate results and replace them with other kits — Shenzhen Bioeasy’s kits. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic offered to dump them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a “high error rate” and the Ministry “did not use them”. The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these kits were unfit for use.
Quarantine measures for individuals whose tests tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as observation of people with whom such patients were in contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where a person died of COVID-19 for the first time in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
The entrance to the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of infection.
With intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been far less intense than in other developed countries, and has not had to impose extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and shops.
Many activities there were cancelled, and on March 28 Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home, but the schools, whose holidays ended on March 23, opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions were less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, the mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results of COVID-19 tests to one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the following chart, the percentage of positive results depends on the testing policies adopted in a particular country.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage positive result compared to a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands to remove contaminants, grease, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route.
A person can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as the flu or the common cold, for example, if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical points during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the procedure of care for a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the toilet.
After snoring, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygienic actions associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as of chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for everyone else.
Hand washing is very beneficial for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing can lead to a small increase in the growth rate of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
Reducing diarrhea cases by 48% can be linked to hand washing with soap. Washing hands with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ARI) provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ORI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, killing approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children’s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before meals and after the toilet, which has become a firm habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing your hands also prevents the occurrence of impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to dryness of the skin, and, consequently, to its damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that washing hands too often can lead to itching and peeling of the skin – a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the buttocks of the baby (change of diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish.
Some other cases where hands should be washed in order to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or snoring, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.
In many countries, the procedure of washing hands with soap is not very common.
A study dedicated to handwashing of the day, which was conducted in 2015 in 54 countries, showed that on average for 38.7% of families, handwashing with soap is a common practice. A 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US in this list of hands is closer to the middle, and there is a change in the time of China, their indicator is 77%; the lowest rate was recorded in 23%.
The Philippine Ministry of Education’s “Emergency Health Care Program” is an example of large-scale interventions to improve children’s health and education.
At the heart of this national program is deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluoride.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective skin cleanser, as fats and proteins that are components of organic contaminants are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the purification process.
Solid soap, due to its reusable use, can also contain bacteria that can get on it with previous use.
A small number of studies focusing on getting bacteria on the skin from a contaminated piece of solid soap indicates that it is unlikely because the bacteria are washed off with foam.
The CDC still argues that “liquid soap with a manual dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing.”
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in communities that care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are inherently resistant to antibiotics.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised one.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agents, we also have the same surfactant and skin-protecting compounds, the complex compounds can usually contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, lactic) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fragrances (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts, etc.).
Hot water at a comfortable temperature for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, to remove natural fats that retain contaminants and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizer that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, antiseptic hand sanitizers or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these agents are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners such as carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, providing ease of use of these agents and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacillus, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction of 3.5 is similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% – 99.999% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction of 4-5) on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use a sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing agent to thoroughly treat and impregnate the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and back of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is completely absorbed.
The fingertips of both hands should also be washed thoroughly. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you choose to wash your hands rather than use disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily contaminated.
The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be a substitute for a full wash of hands, if there is an opportunity to use water and soap.
Frequent use of hand disinfectants on an alcoholic basis can cause dry skin, if their composition does not contain emollients and (or) moisturizers for the skin.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other emollients to the composition of the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollient components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants, practically do not occur.
The lower likelihood of irritating contact dermatitis has been a factor in favor of choosing disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, water-free products do not clean hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as ordinary soap and water, since when using such agents, the pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer is largely dependent on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing agents.
More recently, it has been shown that drugs that use benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, as it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, as an alternative, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends hand washing techniques that include the following steps:
Wash your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to run water, because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as the areas between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (and not just one water), people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Treat your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Rinse your hands thoroughly under running water.
Rinse hands in stagnant water can provoke re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry on their own.
Wet and wet hands are easier to get contaminated. Most often, people ignore areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent the skin of the hands from drying out, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water out of a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes made and/or using ash if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supply, there are other options. In places with limited water supply, such as schools or rural areas, there are no such solutions as water in developing countries.
A foot pedal crane is a simple construction consisting of a capacity suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to spill water onto the hands; a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on the production of paper towels and towels; the subject of this study was a comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern flow-through hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads on average increased by 194%, and on the palms - by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increased by 42%, and on the palms - by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads on average decreases to 76%, and on the palms of the hands - up to 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to the toilet rooms and the environment of the toilet with each type of drying.
The jet-air dryer, which releases air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other users of the toilet and toilet in a radius of up to 2 meters.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
When using paper towels, there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed, depending on the method of drying the hands:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying paper towels.
Hand cleaning with disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution when traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Hand sanitizer based on alcohol should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its high efficiency (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in hospital conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices, indeed, helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, crossing fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to rinse them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying hands, closing the faucet, as well as, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, you should use a paper towel.
This avoids re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with the use of a catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard hand washing and treatment procedure that should be applied in the health sector.
The WHO draft manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
A corresponding review was conducted by Whitby in co-authorship.
If compliance with regulatory requirements is required, commercial devices can be used to measure and check hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the “five moments” when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before using antiseptics, and
after patient care procedures. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap when washing hands ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be needed before surgical operations or in a high content of antibiotic-resistant organisms. To “clean hands” before surgery requires a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching it with your hands; also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to rinse your hands with.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow usually within 2-6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water from the forearms should not fall back on the hands.
After washing, hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical bathrobe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after the procedures of caring for a sick person.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from handwashing comes from the first 20% of handwashing, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of handwashing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, washing hands with ordinary soap leads to a more than threefold increase in the incidence of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. The comparison of hand rubbing with an alcohol solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds of washing with antibacterial soap, showed that the treatment of hands with antibacterial soap is 6 percent of the time.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcoholic hand solutions in terms of reducing the amount of influenza A virus H1N1 and Clostridium difficile spores on hands. Activities to develop hand hygiene in medical facilities may include training staff to wash their hands, increasing the availability of alcoholic hand solutions, as well as written and oral reminders to the staff
More research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various medical institutions.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of a stable water supply, soap or handwashing products in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to develop the habit of washing hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has a faucet for washing hands, although there are cheap ways to organize hand washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in population behavior.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results are necessary.
In a systematic analysis of 70 studies, it was found that to improve the situation with hand hygiene in countries with lower-middle incomes, sanitary and epidemic supervision at the community level is effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of advocacy for handwashing in schools is the approach of the United Nations Children's Fund. We also promoted the requirements of other schools. We promoted the school's "Three Star Approach": it promotes
Assuring compliance with the minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of washing machines is one of the possible measures implemented within the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce the level of morbidity and child mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children’s Fund promotes the use of emoji symbolizing hand washing.
Some studies looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (saving years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more economical solution compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and by Medens N (Flor Nighting)
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by putrefactive odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and infections related to the provision of medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States began to actively promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “proper handwashing techniques” were displayed in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing hands” means showing your unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to be a participant in something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when deciding the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; later this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth involuntarily washes her hands in an attempt to clear herself of an imaginary blemish that symbolizes an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she committed herself and prompted her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who recalled or observed any unethical act tended to wash their hands more often compared to other people, and for them, washing hands is more important.
Also, people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing it are less likely to participate in any other “cleansing” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. We are the action of the Gilen especially, the predestination of the religion.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require that people wash their hands after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
The control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the application of occupational safety and health practices for the purpose of risk control and the fight against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Appropriate control of workplace risks depends on the location and task, based on an assessment of the risks, the severity of the epidemic situation in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable due to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) reported that lower-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases, basic infection control measures are required, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay home for signs of illness, adhering to respiratory labels, and carrying out daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Intermediate-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who have no confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to become infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include public relations workers, such as in schools, high-density working environments and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-performance air filters, the use of protective shields and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical staff and morgues who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are in the high-risk category, with the risk increasing to very high when such staff perform procedures accompanied by aerosol formation or collecting/processing samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Risk control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of engineering safety equipment such as negative pressure ventilated rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task concerned.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of impacts in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others or fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may vary with respect to both the types of goods for which there is demand and the ways in which such goods are purchased (for example, making purchases in off-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the car).
Finally, interruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19 are possible. When organizing protection, you can use the Plan for epidemic preparedness and response.
The plans address the risks associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors occurring at home and in communities, as well as individual workers’ risk factors such as old age or the presence of chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the controls needed to address such risks, as well as emergency action plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may follow recommendations at the national or state level.
Some of the goals to ensure responses to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations and minimize negative consequences for other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
Risk control hierarchy is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such funds according to effectiveness.
If it is impossible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19, the most effective engineering and technical security means, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection means.
Safety engineering involves isolating employees from workplace-related hazards and not relying on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures that require action from an employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the threat to the worker, adapted to the size (e.g. respirators), used constantly and properly, checked regularly, maintained in proper condition and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) believes that the positions with the least risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic anti-epidemic measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory labels, including hand-closing when coughing and sneezing, provision of wipes and garbage containers, readiness for use of equipment, readiness for use of equipment as well as handling of tools remotely and shifting daily, as necessary, recommendations for workers to depart.
Quickly identifying and isolating individuals who could potentially be infected is a critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home until the heat stops, no fever, and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretics or other medications to relieve the symptoms, and prescribes that staff members should ensure that such policies are flexible.
According to the OSHA, medium-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed evidence or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community in the territory where the business is located, or in connection with the recent travel of such a person to COVID-19 sites.
The following categories include the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work, the personnel in charge of work.
In rare cases, workers at risk may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on an airplane, measures such as isolating a sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for a sick person, providing the patient with a mask, or asking such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or chilling are required to ensure adequate safety of workers and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biosafe bag, and contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In cases with commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, safety measures include postponing the trip in case of illness, self-isolation or other symptoms, and promptly informing someone at the medical center.
Ideally, a medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
In the presence of a minimum or average level of infection prevalence in the community, social distancing strategies may be implemented, for example, cancellation of visits for face-to-face meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as physical education or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between the desks, adjusting the time of arrival and care of children, limiting the time of arrival and the place of care of symptoms, limiting non-essive visits.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for long-term non-school attendance may be considered. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are encouraged to follow the same instructions as those prescribed by ambulance paramedics, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their uniform belts and equipment before reuse with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposal of personal protective equipment used, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that certain categories of health care workers and morgues are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff contacting patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when performing procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, or when collecting/processing samples from persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanying aerosol formation include probing, cough-inducing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or sampling by invasive methods.
High-risk morgue workers include personnel involved in the treatment of the bodies of people with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such personnel conduct an autopsy, then they are transferred to the category of very high risk. Additional engineering and technical safety measures for such risk groups include the use of insulated rooms for patients with a confirmed COVID-19 disease or under-education.
In some health facilities and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Samples should be handled in accordance with the precautions provided for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to demarcated waiting zones depending on the presence of suspected COVID-19 infection. Among other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers interacting at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed illness or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In the United States, approved NIOSH respirators for a person with an N95 or higher filter class should be used as part of a comprehensive written program on respiratory protection, which specifies the requirements for individual selection of means and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for an employee. WHO does not recommend the use of workwear because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted respiratoryly rather than through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends the use of surgical masks only for personnel performing screening at the point of admission of patients.
For individuals collecting samples from the airways of COVID-19 patients or carriers of the disease without procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective screen for the face, bathrobes and gloves.
When performing procedures accompanied by the formation of an aerosol, instead of a surgical mask should wear a respirator N95 or FFP2.
Given the insufficient availability of personal protective equipment around the world, WHO recommends monitoring and minimizing the need for such protective equipment by using the capabilities of remote medicine, physical barriers, such as transparent windows, providing access to the patient infected with COVID-19, only those persons who provide direct care with the same persons, using only those personal protective equipment that are necessary for a specific task, continuing.

DATE/TIME OF DELIVERY: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Permissions: CC0: No protected rights
We are living in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the capacity for empathy, cooperation and development of communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen friendly and caring relationships between all of our colleagues, reflected in e-mails, calls and chats – a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.
It is with great gratitude and pride that I speak of you as colleagues.
Last week I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how beneficial it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it is to ensure the functionality of the sites, payment by our colleagues or to protect the security of the communities.
The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever.
In such a time, in order to achieve meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes to the way we work together starting next week.
Adjustment of the order of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
According to our expectations, it will be necessary to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are received.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now; whatever your needs may be, whether it’s caring for your family, buying groceries, or going to a doctor’s appointment, your well-being is our number one priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you are sick, you should not work.
This is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
There’s no need to take a sick leave or leave: just inform your supervisor and help the team revise their calendar and work schedule to ensure they cover key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, please let Brian of T&C Ops know so that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation.)
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirm our intention to comply with our obligations to our contractors and employees at the hourly rate of payment.
Everyone will be paid according to the usual hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you can not work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in times like these.
Again, it’s about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered significant.
We should always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current goals and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.
Slowing down today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “twice as much to catch up” after the pandemic ends.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What happens to the APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations in terms of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the deadline for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing employees to prioritize critical work, self-help and care for loved ones, while ensuring a shortened schedule for the next few weeks for everyone who needs or wants to work.
Such an extension of time limits can significantly reduce the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, informing representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Condition of the office, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as for reception and elevator halls, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building has its own rules, which prescribe caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Columbia (DC) is located on the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all staff based in DC its COVID-19-related policies.
Last week, our D.C. office completely switched to remote work in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider breaking them down into a course of several days.
Define clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send materials for review in advance.
By default, use video communication, to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator - a person who will monitor the incoming of questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as responsible for taking notes (or joint notes).
If you need to use a convenient headset, contact the technical support team by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when buying snacks.
Connect to the #remotions channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics guides available in webinar format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel mass events funded by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and inform you that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of carrying out agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for involuntary delays or alteration of such goals.
We will be holding follow-up events next week with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general mood in the global community is not only a disappointment with the interruption, but also a sense of relief in connection with mutual understanding and the ability to focus on one’s own communities, Wikimedia and more.
In terms of prospects, CRT is working on a page in Meta-Wiki that will provide a space for the community to keep track of impact and communication.
We remain in touch on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will take the opportunity to additionally share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We are together in this situation and we are ready to help as much as we can.
At the same time, you can still receive information from such electronic correspondence, and other important information about COVID-19 is from the Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff residing in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about trips, events, key workflow, information coverage issues or other assistance, please contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have privacy concerns, please email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a waiver of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and ensure the ability to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world with the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate times.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for the important work that lies ahead in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
For this to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with maximum return as soon as that need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of the renal amino acid collectrin.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I, its enzymatically active domain reaches the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar type II lung cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.
ACE2 iRNA biosynthesis is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, cleaves the carboxylic amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-His-Ile-His).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
Being a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding of the S1 protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 adhesion to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the S protein to be primed with the TMPRSS2 carrier serine protease, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE inhibitors and ACE inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group.”
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of developing pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than in patients at overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be an innovation in therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygenation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory failure syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the exposure duration of 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising remedy for people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile phone software applications designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. in identifying individuals (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several application options for contact tracking have been developed.
This has spawned a debate about privacy issues, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
Softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate Bluetooth-based support functionality directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is used.
The app was developed by local IT companies, is open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched the Bluetooth-powered “StopKorona!” app, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and ensures prompt communication with health authorities.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said the contact tracking app was in its final development stage and would be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar apps are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geozoning function, the purpose of which is to ensure that patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a security professor at the University of Cambridge, points out a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false triggers and potential inefficiency if the application is used by only a small part of the population.
Given concerns about the proliferation of misleading or malicious “coronavirus” apps, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that may offer their coronavirus-related apps on the App Store to include only “official” or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Participants in the privacy campaign expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question of whether the surveillance infrastructure established to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat disappears was raised.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of oversight.
The organizations announced eight conditions for their state projects:
The monitoring must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by limitation clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
digital surveillance should exclude cases of aggravated discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their terms and conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to tackle the ongoing surveillance problem, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their devices’ operating systems as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download the app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have large potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that use central servers for communication purposes only (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use apps as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected persons, but also made the location information publicly available, which was made possible due to significant changes to the data protection legislation that were made after the MERS outbreak in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both centralized and confidential systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been released.
Contact tracking that preserves privacy is an established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user’s approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracing with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), other contacts for monitoring (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), and protocols for monitoring.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures privacy when collecting and using location data or crossing pathways to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on research presented in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma Media MPC, which is also a technology-developing company.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of this data.
On April 5, 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols founded the global coalition TCN, whose goal is to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key factor in their widespread distribution.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in the operation of its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that oversee the operation of the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would provide privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve privacy.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deploying tools that allow governments to create official applications to track the movements of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with data confidentiality
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to address ongoing surveillance issues by first deploying the system through operating system updates and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Drug repositioning (also known as reprofiling, redirection, task change, or therapeutic drug redirection) is the reprofiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or medical condition other than the disease originally envisaged in development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-resistant proteins, each with several ligand-binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against the COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP-ribophosphatase.
Hussein AA and co-authors in their preclinical study examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their similarity in structure to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical trials.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs under study in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in the state of New York on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Application Authorization (EUA).
The treatment regimen has not been approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental emergency treatment in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial regimens.
The CDC stated that “the order of use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine intake for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when “there is no other way out.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Langone School of Medicine is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is “unambiguously effective.”
In 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug, a negative result was obtained after an average of 4 days, while in 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
A study was conducted in Wuhan in which 240 patients with pneumonia were followed, one half of whom received favipiravir and the other half umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that the results indicating the effectiveness of the drug are scarce and should not be considered final.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug in Japan to replenish its stockpiles and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe told the Trump administration about the possibility of purchasing the drug. The drug may be less effective in advanced cases of the disease.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to get pregnant.
According to the results of one study devoted to the combination of antiviral drugs "lopinavir" and "ritonavir" (Kaletra), it was concluded that "the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been revealed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community is criticizing the re-profiling of drugs that have been specifically developed for the treatment of HIV and AIDS.
WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences found that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of phylo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations, which can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Clinics; one conducted on patients with moderate disease and the other on patients with more severe disease.
There are currently three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, tests of the antibiotic azithromycin began in the state of New York.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma, for its use in the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
The Phase II trial, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is conducted in 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of the disease to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, breastfeeding women and women who do not use effective contraception cannot participate in this study.
In Italy, several coagulants are being tested.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used for the treatment of patients, which prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to publish recommendations for the use of this drug.
On April 14, a multicentre study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy to study the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on re-profiling approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS, and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially suitable for use as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tested in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is the hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be available earlier than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates underwent Phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investment in vaccine development and related research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of CEPI’s vaccine development initiative are to ensure the required speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in Phase I safety studies are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (developer of stage I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, another 37 candidate vaccines were reported, but little public information is available on them (presumably, they are in the planning or development stage).
Preliminary testing for safety and immunogenicity is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and in several sites with the simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Stage III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for efficacy in terms of disease prevention and side effects are simultaneously monitored at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in preclinical trials).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular-clamped vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate the immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine with the aim of starting human testing in 2021.
The start of vaccine development projects was also announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies led by Hanneke Schuitmaker announced the start of work on their vaccine.
Janssen and its biotechnology partner Vaxart are developing an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to that used for vaccination against neoantigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of work on the synthesis of the vaccine and the start of trials.
On February 27, 2020, the Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a project to develop the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a candidate vaccine drug that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, which are located in western Maryland, announced that they are developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it has entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of vaccines.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in an accelerated mode, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported that it had created a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large sums of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on mRNA.
BNT162 is a candidate for an mRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of preclinical trials in April 2020, and their final candidate vaccine preparation could begin testing in humans as early as autumn.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI’s total investment in developing a COVID-19 vaccine is $29 million.
Other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020, that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million to fund 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to create a national “vaccine bank” that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines, causing strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that emerged 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo's Canadian School of Pharmacy announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that could be produced in the form of a nasal spray.
With the help of bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities merged the resources of IBM supercomputers combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits in addition to their disease-prevention properties.
Another randomized study, which is being conducted in Australia, involved 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, point to the need for containment measures with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines available to treat SARS that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of atypical pneumonia has been a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the study of SARS, which was being conducted at the time, could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were virus-vector-based vaccines in development, two adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS).
There was a conspiracy theory circulating on social media that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all, and that a vaccine against it already exists.
The social media posts cited the words of some patients who claimed the existence of patents on the genetic sequences of other strains of the coronavirus, such as the coronavirus SARS, as well as on vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are reduced to the manifestation of mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads when people are in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops released into the air when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets are formed when exhaled, they usually pose a threat by hitting the ground or the surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also become infected by touching the contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of symptoms and in later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a smear from the nasopharynx.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected disease, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population vary: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected individuals may have no symptoms or have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or feeling of tightness in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, blueness of the face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Less frequently, symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may occur.
Also, in different percentages, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed.
Some cases reported in China were initially manifested only by a feeling of tightness in the chest and rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and eventually death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days after infection. According to available data, symptoms do not appear in all infected people.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is still completely unknown, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of infected people with asymptomatic course of the disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations due to the virus, the course of the disease was asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily report on April 1; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) had declined asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a higher concentration of the virus.
With loud speech, more drops are released into the air than with speech of normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore found that with an open cough, drops can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
The virus is generally not airborne, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission is still possible, and testing of air recycled by air collectors located in corridors outside people’s rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before symptoms appear, but the risk is small.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one person usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a cardboard surface, the virus is able to live for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when used properly, have a rather beneficial effect in terms of infection control: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and is also able to eliminate it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient, the highest content of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory diseases reported in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in coronaviruses related in nature.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.
The virus connects with ACE2 and penetrates into the host cell with the help of a characteristic surface glycoprotein - a "spike" (peplomer).
12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in the severe form of the disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they participate in the work of this organ.
A high incidence of thromboses (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in OIT with COVID-19 and may indicate unfavorable prognosis. An autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocytocytic light inflammatory
Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, in patients with severe COVID-19, symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation have been observed.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF T cells have been shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also found during autopsy.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained with a smear from the nasopharynx, but a smear sample from the nose or sputum can also be used.
Results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results do not matter directly.
Chinese scientists have isolated a strain of the coronavirus and published its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of this virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests for antibodies that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were under development, but have not yet become widespread.
The Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests showed that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, giving permission for its use at the end of this month. The diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University Zhunnan Hospital outline methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral polygonal subpleural focuses of seals of the type "matte glass" with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of cystic pavement (ulnar thickening of the septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological examination performed at the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, constriction and swelling of the lungs
There are four types of severity of viral pneumonia:
mild form of pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocyte, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DVC syndrome); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, following respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to carry out a quality hygienic procedure for the hands.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infection by persons with asymptomatic course of the disease. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and enterprises were closed, the movement of citizens was limited and large pubs were abolished.
The distancing guidelines also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs with proven efficacy against COVID-19. Since the completion of the vaccine development is expected no earlier than 2021, the bulk of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 comes down to a decrease in the peak of the epidemic known as the “plateau exit”.
The CDC also recommends washing hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating and after snoring, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant alcohol-containing (alcohol content of at least 60%) hand-processing agent, but only in cases where soap and water are not available. For regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these compositions, ethanol or isopropanol are used, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable agent for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, adherence to the rules of personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource - IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line drugs, some medical professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
When performing procedures in which airborne discharge may occur, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission, especially in medical facilities.
Healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19 are recommended by the CDC to be placed in an airborne isolation facility (AIIR) — an additional measure in addition to standard precautions in terms of contact and air. The CDC has published recommendations on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective gown, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above means, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Application Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used not according to the instructions, the effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face shields or, as a last resort, making masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the forms of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require artificial ventilation or alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
A type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is currently being actively studied, with some evidence in favor that intubation can be avoided with a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods is as effective for critically ill patients as IVL.
Some doctors make a choice in favor of invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if it is available, since this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to nasal cannulas with intensive airflow. The risk of severe disease for the elderly (those who are over 60 years old, and especially those who are over 80 years old) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there is a shortage of hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the surge in COVID-19 cases in severe form requiring hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for their lung ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of providing artificial ventilation of the lungs is complicated, as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), developing with COVID-19, and oxygenation entail more and more problems.
Inhalation pressure-supported IVLs and PDAs are necessary to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal ventilation damage that can result in pneumothorax.
On earlier models of fans, high PDCV may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
The most promising is Remdesivir.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs under test have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers take part in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is threatened by a serious or imminent danger.
Its use has not been subjected to clinical trials that should be conducted to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak.
To log in, users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect “close contact” using observation data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence – such tools are used to track infected people and people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave security authorities permission to track the cell phone data of people who were allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology was introduced to identify quarantine violators.
Italy’s regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said cellular operators reported that “40% of people still move around the territory.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O’Connor as saying: “Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease can occur in a mild form with minor or absent symptoms resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold.
Patients with a mild form of the disease generally recover within two weeks, while treating patients with severe or critical forms may take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In individuals with the most severe course of COVID-19 disease, it can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.
Thrombotic abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while renal impairment is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early-stage disease studies, the median time from the onset of symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, and for women it was 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of postmortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocyte.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems consisted of elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary by condition due to such regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
Insufficiently effective counting of cases in mild form can lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms overall, and such patients were approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were expressed about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The administration of one of the clinics in Hong Kong found that in some patients who recovered from this disease, the volume of the lungs decreased by 20-30%, and their scans revealed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to “After Intensive Care” syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether recovered patients developed persistent immunity against the virus.
Judging by the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but cases have also been reported where, after recovering from COVID-19, coronavirus tests were still positive.
It is believed that in these cases there was an exacerbated protracted course of the disease, and not re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, of animal origin, and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from person to person.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date of the first case of the disease.
According to official data released by WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary by region and time of disease spread, and are also influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency code to the disease: U07.1 - for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 - for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822,2,240,191).
This figure varies by region. Some other methods include determining the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, and determining the infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a particular segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have undergone infection, by the presence of such antibodies it is possible to tell how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of the carnival among young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, Germany’s health care system has not been overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, according to donor blood counts.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The most at-risk group is men over 50; the gap between men and women narrows only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, concomitant diseases in men (e.g., hypertension, manifested in men at a younger age than in women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 occurred in men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nursing staff, are women, respectively, they are more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease – COVID-19.
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease” and 19 is the year the outbreak was first identified: December 31, 2019.
Such a name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, WHO additionally uses the terms “Covid-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19”.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Uhanq coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographic locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2" were published.
Due to the constraints of standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers are printing medical supplies, such as swabs for taking swabs from the nose, as well as details of IVL devices.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier could not deliver it within the required time, then one of the local factories was redesigned and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and false information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread at a high rate on the Internet.
It is likely that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At the moment, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs for its treatment.
Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are currently being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the Solidarity Trial, which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
A ready-made vaccine does not yet exist, but various organizations are actively developing candidate vaccine preparations.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells via the ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments use the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, the researchers are looking to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead form, is aimed at triggering a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-tip-shaped protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method for creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Anti-telewave amplification has been identified as one of the potential challenges in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
The drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reprofiling of antiviral drugs accounts for most of the Chinese studies; by the end of April, nine phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted. Several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered for the same purpose, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir interferon in combination.
As of March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivar are available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the US, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also listed interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as agents against COVID-19.
Preliminary evidence suggests that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed in vivo study, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires the fixation of the spike protein with serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2).
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these therapies without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have the properties of hypercytokinemia. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of the coronavirus.
This drug entered Stage 2 of a non-randomized test, which is conducted nationally in Italy, after positive results were obtained from its use in patients with a severe form of the disease.
In combination with a serum test for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, T-cell CAR therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to people who need them is now considered a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tried in the treatment of patients with SARS, but its results have been inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may also be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The use of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.
