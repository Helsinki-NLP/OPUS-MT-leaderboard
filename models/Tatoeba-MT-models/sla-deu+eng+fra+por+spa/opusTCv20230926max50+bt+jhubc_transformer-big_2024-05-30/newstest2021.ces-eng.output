Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, <0xC5><0xA0>koda also scored
Defender Filip Novák helped the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2–1 at Kayserispor and held third Besiktas in a row.
After the transfer from Slavia in January, Milan <0xC5><0xA0>koda scored the tenth goal for Rizespor, which was saved even though he lost 1:3 on the Fenerbahce field.
Novak confirmed the excellent productivity of the defender with the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper of Kayserispor only fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from an angle hit the ball into the net.
The home team managed to make up five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the setup pulled the victory to his side when he successfully finished the break four on one.
<0xC5><0xA0>koda in the opening of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after a solo at 1:1.
Rizespor did not hold a tie for a long time, but he did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of his opponents, he remained three points above the descent zone.
The competition will end with Sunday’s duel of the Basaksehir champions at the Kasimpasa field.
Well-secret Cave at the hermit in the woods near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor in the <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipská region, several sandstone rock formations hide in the forests led by the Count's Road.
Natural and artificially created.
And we'll go after that man-made one.
The place is called the Cave of the Hermit.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely, a shelter for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rocky spore and is accessible by stairs from above.
It is practically not visible until the last minute.
It will be revealed only by a narrow staircase leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where you only enter the rock.
Although the chamber seems to be far from human habitation, at the time of its formation it may have been on the plateau, where the forest is today, a field.
"The fact that the building does not have a window or a traditional fireplace proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter," explains historian Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek from the Faculty of Arts Jan Evangelista Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench at the back, apparently used to store containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek.
There are traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
Breaking the sandstone with a canine was quite simple and quick for the insiders.
It was enough to properly use the joints and gradually break the sandstone.
Based on the length of the ridge mark and the method of mowing, it is possible to estimate the period of the cave’s formation.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the mess that appears in it, someone sometimes sleeps there nowadays.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and you are interested in the flowing stream and the nearby count's path, you will surely find the path down.
And on the way from the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Mina<0xC5><0x99>ík is in artificial sleep after a severe fall in Germany
"Phillip is in the best hands.
The Institute is equipped for such cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This greatly facilitates my situation and also the care of Finja's daughter," Mina<0xC5><0x99>ík's wife Katja said in a statement.
"Everyone is doing their best, Philip needs time to recover now.
There is no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever faced the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," the woman said.
Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes race in Ascot on Saturday, called for financial support for the injured Mina<0xC5><0x99>ík on Twitter, equalizing the legend Lester Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been collected on Gofundme.
The target is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million crowns).
Video referee took the football players Sassuolo four goals, lost 0:2
Sassuolo scored four goals in Saturday's match in Naples, but eventually had to accept a 0-2 loss.
None of their goals were recognized by the referee after consultation with the video due to offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record adversity of the technology, so many hits VAR has never failed one team.
"The VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than the roadside radar and punished him like no other team.
The new technology breaks records," the Gazzetta dello Sport said in a commentary.
"Sassuolo's Unrecognized Goal Festival.
VAR has never been so tough on one team,” added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of play it seemed that Sassuolo equalized.
However, the goal of Filip Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> was not recognized after the intervention of the video judge due to offside.
For the same reason, Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>'s next intervention and the hits of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi did not apply.
The home team added another goal.
Electric cars set a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they were the most recharged in history
"The growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as by the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Chmelík, Head of Clean Technologies at <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla’s electric car maker, as well as Bill and Lidl supermarkets, are reporting their share of the market.
Operators of classic gas stations are represented by MOL.
She doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our electric mobility network only last year," said Jana Jusková, a spokeswoman for the company.
However, the newspaper exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
According to them, the drivers of the stations took an average of 13.5 kWh.
This is equivalent to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
With the exception of small pumps up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling was then carried out in a free tariff.
If motorists already paid for the subscription, their typical expenditure was around CZK 330.
E-mobility is particularly rampant in the capital.
On the territory of Prague, there are all five of the busiest chargers of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ company, which will overshadow entire regional cities with their popularity.
Olomouc leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border region, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In a large-scale poll by the Czech daily, 8% of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far on the issues of protecting and healing the Czech landscape and resolving the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more vigorous approach.
The event called Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people here who have long been opposed to the expansion of the Turów mine, there are people who oppose the mining of gravel at Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Ostroh, there are people who oppose the construction of nonsensical dams," Marika Volfová told the organizers.
She said the main demands of the protesters were to create a plan to retain water in the countryside, a dramatic change in agricultural policy and subsidy system towards promoting sustainable agriculture, and a swift transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not the reckless and devastating business," she said.
On Malostranské nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí, a booth was placed with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End the rapeseed depression" or "Less coal, more chopsticks".
Jan <0xC5><0xA0>koda from the Association for Water for People, which protests against the plan to mine gravel in the Hodonín region, came to Prague from South Moravia.
"It threatens a source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravel mining is located only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to the assessments, it is certain that the water quality will be compromised.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> came for the so-called agro-ecological farmers from the village of Vale<0xC4><0x8D> in Karlovy Vary.
He drew attention to the advantages of small farms, which are unmarried for income and profit and supply residents on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are capable of feeding the entire population quite normally, but on top of that they do not cause such destruction in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people killed in plane crash on house in Germany
An ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in West Germany on Tuesday, killing three people and injuring two others.
Local rescue services said two crew members and one resident of the house were believed to be among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters were able to get the flames under control.
Robert Meyboom, the deputy commander of the local fire department, said both crew members were believed to have died.
The third victim, according to police, was a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing the mayor of Wesel, said it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from her apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a brake on landing.
Police believe it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The aircraft took off from an airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane collapsed in the air before hitting the ground.
On Saturday, the Czech Savings Bank incorrectly charged for some card payments twice.
The error has already been corrected
On Saturday afternoon, <0xC4><0x8C>eská spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna incorrectly charged some card payments to its clients twice.
According to a bank spokesman, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The Savings Bank has already corrected the error and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with the double charging of card payments Savings Bank recorded on Saturday afternoon.
“Yesterday (Saturday) we updated the system and immediately returned all these duplicate payments to the clients.
At the moment, everything is working without problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice, the spokesperson of the bank does not know, according to his estimate, these were lower thousands of transactions.
The causes of the problems are being investigated by the Savings Bank.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," Kropík said.
<0xC4><0x8C>eská spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
At the end of March, it was 4.6 million.
The Savings Bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch on Monday will present a system of three emergency stages against the coronavirus
"Degrees will be based on the strength of the community spread at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
This will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked in green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The Minister added that he will still discuss the inclusion of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian region would have the orange color at the moment and Prague would be approaching it.
The map will also show individual measures for regional sanitary stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at the regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," said Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch.
Aquarius and Karolínka
When the waterman Joná<0xC5><0xA1> and the miller’s daughter Karolínka fall in love with each other, it is not easy at all.
Jonah is prevented in love by his father, the rude waterman Hastrbuch, and Karolina has no idea that her dear Jonah is not a man.
Luckily, there is a young Libor, who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Karolínka, from this Aquarius villain.
What if he lies and tries to lie?
Especially if she can get Karolina to reject Jonah and give preference to him, the brave Libor.
Soon it will be clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the Midnight Teapot, the rotten flour, the fire of the mill and other bad things.
Angry villagers will hunt for the Aquarius, and an irreconcilable Aquarius curse will fall on Jonah’s head.
And now the soul of Konvi<0xC4><0x8D>ek advises Karolina!
How to soften the old Hastrich, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in <0xC4><0x8C>T studios and outdoors at the Brzina pond, in Obd<0xC4><0x9B>nice in the Sedl<0xC4><0x8D>any region and in the beautiful surroundings of the historic mill in Hoslovice.
Mosteck<0xC3><0xBD> autodrom launches a new e-shop
Customers of the Mostek autodrome can use a new e-shop on its website.
They will also purchase vouchers for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large race track, which was previously only possible in person at the autodrome worker in the starting tower.
"We have taken the initiative to improve the e-shop so that it is user-friendly, while at the same time expanding the portfolio of products and services that can be acquired through it.
At the same time, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of CZK 1,000 on all safe driving courses from our offer.
The discount coupon can be found at www.autodrom-most.cz," explained Jana Svobodová, Sales and Marketing Director of AUTODROM MOST.
According to her, the e-shop’s website is now clear, the customer can easily navigate through it.
"The visitor of the e-shop chooses on the bar the focus he is targeting.

When paying for the selected product or service, the customer can choose one of four options.
Payment by deposit (bank transfer), cash on delivery, cash on hand or online via the payment gateway.
Most cases are mild, with only 3% of patients in the hospital.
Either a milder form of the coronavirus is spreading in the Czech Republic, or a summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
The infectious departments of hospitals are half-empty, although the numbers of infected are growing.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and this is mainly due to the number of hospitalizations," Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch confirms.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic was peaking in our country, everyone wore masks, the army carried out the collections, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfectants for a year in advance.
Ten people died every day.
Now the daily increase in the number of infected is higher, but every day with Covid-19, at most two people die.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected per population, while Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's center, where 57 patients - 40 clients and 17 employees - are already infected.
Another home for the elderly was closed by hygienists in <0xC4><0x8C>erno<0xC5><0xBE>ice, Královéhradecke.
The disease was confirmed by tests in one of the nurses.
"We are tracing, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygienic measures," says the director of the retirement home, Martin Schanel.
According to him, none of the clients of the home have yet symptoms of the disease.
Extensive testing will begin hygienic tomorrow and then decide on the next measure.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Brno Institute of Oncology has launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which detects if people are wearing a mask when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded 25 cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the Prague company.
In total, 131 people were infected on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but fewer tests were carried out on the weekend.
The debutant champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a fairy tale, Anderson swept away
The tournament’s big surprise, Dimitri van den Bergh, also showed outstanding performance in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced on both sides, the break came at a state of 8-7 for the Belgian archer.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-arrow leg and has been on top ever since.
He was literally crushing his opponent with his game, and the much more experienced "Flying Scotsman" hardly reached the doubles.
The way the "Dreammaker" had him in hand is also evidenced by the fact that the scattered Anderson played his first maximum only in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian handled great high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the eleventh leg, but in an unfavorable condition "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson was very frustrated.
He was throwing darts rather, and his triumphant opponent acted with absolute sovereignty.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of three match darts and kept his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning a trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian dart player, as it is his first major win.
The last player to defeat van den Bergh is Karel Sedlá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
In Nantes, a man pleaded guilty to the fire of the cathedral
The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original stained glass windows of the 16th century and destroyed the organ.
Investigators were investigating the suspected arson because the fire was moving through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police at the entrances found no signs of anyone entering the cathedral forcibly.
The defendant is a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee, a volunteer at a local diocese.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without launching a criminal prosecution.
Prosecutors said the man had been arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch: On Monday we will present a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is supposed to serve as a pandemic plan, the absence of which is criticized by the government and the Ministry of Health.
"The degrees will be based on the strength of the community spread," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach the middle, orange degree.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in individual regions varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS).
According to the minister, specific measures will be followed up on each stage, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan in the Prima Party television program, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been increasing in recent days, although the number of hospitalizations remains low.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch commented that there is nothing fundamentally wrong to talk about declaring a state of emergency or convening a crisis staff again.
In view of the growing number of infected people since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has once again introduced the obligation to wear masks at indoor events for more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government’s procedure, which until the last moment was not clear what measures would come into effect or when they would be announced, has received criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of security and, on the contrary, straighten the confusion," Senator Marek Hilser said in Questions.
Measures can already vary by region, for example, in Prague from Sunday the obligation to wear masks also applies in non-residential medical facilities, i.e. for example in pharmacies or in waiting rooms at the doctor.
The obligation to wear masks when visiting medical and social institutions or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and <0xC3><0x9A>stí Region since Friday.
In the Highlands of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public spaces, public transport and health facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutná Hora Region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved a so-called traffic light for Europe, which colorfully differentiates the level of risk of infection in individual European countries, and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, as of June 15, the authorities do not require Czech citizens to be tested negative for the coronavirus or instead order a quarantine.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovská continues.
Playing at a third capacity, it was supposed to end at noon
Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota (Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko) Technoparty at Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems are still playing.
According to evening police estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates said about three hundred, in the morning there were 900 of them, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the technoparties were supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time some of the music systems actually died down.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
Music production is still underway.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and disassembly of music systems," said Nováková.
“Police are still rigorously checking out outgoing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or substance abuse.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breathing test before leaving," she added.
The event is overseen by dozens of law enforcement officers, foreign police, traffic and law enforcement police are on the scene, and dog guides with service dogs are also on alert.
"During the day, police checked 470 people moving at the scene and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of whom sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," she said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The police also investigated 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the participants of the technoparty, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
This was stated by Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on Prima Party television.
However, the number of participants fell below 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not necessary, and it was not requested by a sanitary station or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television (<0xC4><0x8C>T) said on Sunday that the technoparty has spread to the surrounding land, whose owners disagreed with the use for technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for the damage.
Fans of techno on the meadow near Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
The police initially guarded the meadow in Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im, Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj, where the technoparty took place last year.
Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im is located about 30 kilometers from Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota, where the technicians finally arrived.
According to Nováková, no one came to Bla<0xC5><0xBE>imi.
Snake bite: little girl ends up in hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in Zheleznorudsk.
A snake bit a girl in her leg, 2010 year, which her parents themselves took to the ambulance service base there," regional spokeswoman of the ambulance service, Mária Svobodová, told Deník, adding that the child was then transported to a hospital in Klatovy.
Snakes are the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in the Bohemian Forest that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that a snake will bite you is not too high, with regular contact, it is afraid of itself.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Even its bite is not a tragedy, its poison is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk of danger is especially in children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
"A person often feels sick after a bite, sweats, has an increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergic people, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from Klatovy Hospital told the Daily.
The man threatened to throw the babies out the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at the policewoman
After 11:00 p.m., an ESU broke into the apartment and detained the man.
The infants were immediately taken care of by the medical staff, said the spokeswoman of the regional police, Markéta Janovská.
The man refused to cooperate with the police, threw dishes, knives or poured wine from the window after the police negotiator.
He reinforced his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
One day, he even climbed onto the window sill, where he crawled.
Police are still investigating the man.
He does not want to disclose any further information yet.
She prefers her daughter to the tennis season.
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be involved in the coronavirus season this year.
The 36-year-old US Open 2011 champion, who became a mother in June, has yet to finish her career.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner, Liz Astling, had given birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay at home, spend time with my family, be there for all the little milestones that our Evie is going through over the next six months, and just enjoy it," the former world number one in doubles said in a statement.
The WTA Tour will resume the suspended season on 3 August with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Raze reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the complex transported 1,320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition, under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the sanitation plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
Inspecting the live fish stall then found that the seller does not have proof of the origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be problematic from a veterinary point of view in the long run.
For example, last autumn, veterinarians discovered an illegal grocery store, which contained almost half a ton of unlabelled food without proof of origin.
For most, the expiration date could not be determined, some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of sepia, the expiry date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police seized 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin phoned Zelensky before the start of the ceasefire in Donbas, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, about the situation in Donbas, where a new ceasefire is due to take effect at midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is set to begin after midnight on Monday, be "complete and universal" and pave the way for the implementation of other provisions of the peace agreements.
In an interview with Zelensky, Putin said that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's parliament last week ruled that upcoming local elections would not be held in pro-Russian rebel-held territory.
The Minsk agreement foresees that Kiev will regain control of the border of the Ukrainian territories occupied by the separatists with Russia after granting these regions wide autonomy and holding local elections there.
Zelensky’s office said the two leaders agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass and the need to take further measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining areas of fighting or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimean peninsula and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but occasional skirmishes and artillery attacks continue to kill people on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbass has killed more than 14,000 people since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbass a priority, but there has been no major breakthrough in the negotiations so far.
Unexpected champion in decathlon is Rykl, Novotná dominated the seven-game
Defender of the last two titles Dole<0xC5><0xBE>al did not finish at the end of Saturday's program four hundred, Kopeck<0xC3><0xBD> on Sunday did not jump the foundation in the pole.
The decathlon was long ruled by the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but resigned after the disc.
Rykl has had two bronze medals from the outer Czech Republic so far, this time he was the only ten-man to reach the 7,000 mark.
Another medal was won by Vilém Strásk<0xC3><0xBD> and Petr Urbanek.
Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í S<0xC3><0xBD>kora after the competition.
“It’s a pity that there weren’t boys here and Kope didn’t start, because that would make the results look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put my facebook 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was delighted with the stick and I was most disappointed with the disc, there I was below average," he admitted on the federation's Facebook page.
On the first day of the seventh fight, Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachová won by more than a hundred points, despite suffering from an injured ankle on the rebound leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she entered only 570 cm, did not throw a spear 40 meters and did not enter the final eight-pointer.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Dvo<0xC5><0x99>áková.
She went above all the distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it was about 630.
Yesterday my calf began to pull me, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all," Novotná said on her Facebook page.
Bio LPG arrives in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular because of its significantly lower price compared to gasoline or diesel, given a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like gasoline and diesel, it has its own environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, this is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market a few years ago and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"In these days, we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our petrol stations in combination with conventional fossil LPG," said Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Karlík of Primagas.
However, bio-LPG cannot be considered as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic petroleum LPG, which many motorists are refueling their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions arbitrarily.
"The only difference compared to conventional LPG is the production method," says Ivan Indrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is one of the great advantages of bio-LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced specifically, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, classical petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by separation in the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, the operation of the bio-LPG car is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than that of petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called "well-to-tank" part (in Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest producers of organic LPG currently includes petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Litvínov refinery.
According to the estimates of the Association in the Czech Republic, about 170,000 LPG-powered vehicles drive; the Ministry of Environment reports a slightly higher number, about 200,000, in the NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, almost 6 thousand conversions of LPG-powered cars were carried out last year alone.
LPG refuelling is possible in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of different operators.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch revised the number of infected, the number decreased by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) ordered the ministry to revise the number of people infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number fell from 5,254 on Saturday to 3,479 on Sunday afternoon, down 1,775.
Currently, there are 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the surge in the number of cured is the revision of data, which hygienists have not been able to update recently," said Jaroslav Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had been infected with coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to Covid-19.
Mobile electorate or by correspondence.
Political scientist and sociologist were looking for variants for the time of the pandemic
In order for people in quarantine due to the coronavirus to vote in the regional and Senate elections in October, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) needs to change the law.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He said this on Sunday at the Prima TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamacek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the current legal framework.
However, the minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine due to health conditions cannot vote.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on the OVM program that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of the ANO or the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record other types of parties) from the correspondence election to be overrated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klima said that now it is necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections), which could be carried out already this year and with the least possible health risk.
He believes that the main one is to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence choice (whether abroad or also in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
They also see the aforementioned constituencies or, for example, the possibility of a substitute vote within the family.
He added that it was possible to learn how similar situations - elections during the coronavirus - were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus, various types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Bukhara: Pig ears thrown at government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the “mafia style of government” that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA news agency said.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th consecutive day, had a weaker participation than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
By 8 p.m., about 300 people had gathered, and some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Protesters outside the government building staged a theatrical scene in which they symbolically imprisoned Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the abolition of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Khadzhigenov, said on public radio that an "escalation summit" in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades across the country" was set to take place on Wednesday.
He reiterated his demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the holding of early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said that he does not intend to resign.
This was justified, inter alia, by the need for Bulgaria to carry out the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government withdrew from a confidence vote in parliament.
Bologna coach Mihajlovic doesn’t want a match without spectators
Bologna football coach Sini<0xC5><0xA1>a Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x87> has had enough of the Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
“What we’re doing here is not football.
I'm tired of fighting without spectators.
It’s a sexless football, it doesn’t bring me any emotions, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks that,” Mihajlovic said before today’s match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, Serie A matches follow in rapid succession, and although they are played only in the evening, their actors are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in the heat.
Under these conditions, you don’t even know how the teams are doing.
I want this season to be over.
Those measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back," said the coach, who also led Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he was missing four months on the bench due to the treatment of leukemia.
“Despite my illness, the break in the league and everything else, our team was able to move up the level.
We want to continue to grow and to do that we need players to be mentally stronger,” he said.
We have become the target of cyberattacks by foreign countries, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said the fire that broke out in an underground nuclear operation in Natanz this month could have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of many other incidents has not yet been clarified.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic’s infrastructure faces “thousands of cyberattacks every day,” according to Iranian media.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to repel.
In recent months, according to Musawi, there have been several broader cyberattacks, which according to analyses were carried out by “certain governments and groups”.
However, he did not give further details about the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musávi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran’s state news agency IRNA this month discussed how enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the United States, may have been behind the recent incidents.
Neither of these countries was directly blamed for the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
The long-standing tensions between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have severely affected its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at US-based bases in Iraq.
The U.S. has admitted that dozens of U.S. troops have been wounded.
Israel regards Iran as its arch-enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA extends production shutdown until May 25
Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
Production lines are scheduled to restart on Monday morning, May 25.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, carmaker spokesman Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paroubek said.
Production has been stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
Initially, the company planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown are closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100% from the beginning, i.e. for two shifts.
The coronavirus is affecting key markets such as Italy, the UK and Spain.
Mayor Michael Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par (Change for Cologne) said that the pause in production at TPCA does not sign on life in the city.
"At first it was clear, the city was empty.
But gradually, the streets are filling up, especially now that Monday has become a lot more relaxed.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed in hostels.
"We didn't have to solve almost any problems in those two months," Kaspar said.
For example, <0xC5><0xA0>koda Auto in Mladá Boleslav, which also stopped production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither of the races is running at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production in <0xC5><0xA0>koda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs around 2,500 people and represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in Cologne.
Breast Cancer Kills Bride Shortly After Marriage: She Leaves a Message to Her Family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson had been battling the insidious cancer, and when she seemed to have conquered the cancer, the disease resurfaced.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up on a bed in a hospice, where she still had enough to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, originally from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her friend Ricky Moore, with whom she had lived for more than 16 years, traveled to competitions around the world.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman who was a healthy athlete was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope of recovering.
After months of treatment, Gemma actually seemed to have won over the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
Bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the British daily Daily Mirror, underwent a ten-hour operation on the spine and then resumed drastic treatment.
But it was all in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, the doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to go to a hospice in Leeds, where her family visited her every now and then, and even arranged her wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gemma wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can’t thank Ricky enough, who was by my side the whole time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on social media.
“I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all of my followers on the social network,” she wrote, saying that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweaty dating, sponge amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, the passer-by will receive a pocket work of mostly novice Czech artists.
They create images and other creations directly for artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit into the size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"The package always contains a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said project curator Petra Wid<0xC5><0xBE>ová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer may be surprised at what kind of artwork he gets.
Currently, he can become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Stoplova or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventure, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutková, prepared a pexeso associated with a walk in Prague.
Cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliana Chomová sell a pocket-sized package of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet made of a troudnate and a fortune-telling card, the second a series of illustrations based on her comic book The Spiritist.
Healthcare salaries are expected to rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
The increase is unrealistic, according to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch
Healthcare salaries could rise by no more than five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) said in Questions of Václav Moravka on Czech Television.
The union’s demand for a 15 percent increase is unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
The hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (of salaries) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect on the current situation, when since March it intervened in the selection of insurance against the coronavirus pandemic and the government's decree against its spread.
Insured incomes were down at the time.
"A 15 percent increase seems unrealistic to me at the moment," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
According to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS), the average monthly earning of a doctor in acute inpatient care is likely to reach CZK 88,312 this year, of a nurse CZK 47,498.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS data also show that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic in 2019 was CZK 34,125, according to the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent, for 2021.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be guided by pay tables, and the contractual wages in hospitals in cities, counties or private ones.
Therefore, they also demand that the salary tables be uniform for healthcare workers.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
In the past year, salaries have risen faster than salaries.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, trade unionists should be aware of the current situation.
Recently, due to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, the House approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
The Council of Healthcare Providers, according to Schmukler, does not agree with the general salary increase next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them through a payment decree.
He also said that the hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel <0xC5><0xA0>vagr, chairman of the State Material Reserve Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently have any protective medical aid in its possession.
It is waiting for the completion of the selection procedures.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
The shrinking smart quarantine could be taken over by the soldiers.
We are ready, they say.
"Smart quarantine works, there is something to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss this with the military tonight.
The army is working perfectly, and the question is whether they shouldn't be running the whole thing again," the prime minister said on Sunday on his Facebook show Chow People.
According to him, it is not possible to connect IT systems and hygienic stations sufficiently, which gradually need to switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the Prime Minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ek told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he had no information on Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the military as an advisory body to the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
On Sunday, Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) criticised the shaky project.
He also suggested that he could be taken by the army again.
Vladimír Dzurilla, the government representative for IT and digitalisation, who is in charge of the project, also admitted the shortcomings in the project.
"The system is working, but it's still being worked on.
For twenty years it was created independently and non-systemically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It's not a jet.
People on the move, poor people on the sanitation on the move are adapting the new systems and actually catching the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "go crazy in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is an effort to "not go crazy in politics," he told the server Respect.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the chairmanship of the ANO movement, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava, led by him, won almost a third of the electorate.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought that I could stand one term and with the experience from the business, I could turn things around and get them back on their feet," he told Respect.
He added that he had been persuaded to some extent for the second term.
"But for me it's the maximum.
I don’t want to mess with politics,” Macura added, describing himself in the interview as a heavy introvert who is not comfortable with frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, for a long time there has been speculation about Macur’s possible end in the ANO movement.
Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example for allying with the SPD or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few figures, ANO supported Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Draho<0xC5><0xA1>, Zeman’s anti-candidate, in the elections.
From the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely vain fight and that no one is in it for me, I have no immediate motive to stop," he said.
Sixty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura was, among other things, the director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also served on the boards of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
Uber will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a consequence of the change in the law, said Petr Kratochvíl (ODS), the Brno City Councilor for Transport, in a press release on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions, such as the designation as a taxi or a taxi meter.
However, the change of the law has since July changed the conditions for the operation of conventional and alternative taxis.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to legally operate.
The city was acquainted with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," said Kratochvíl.
Uber has worked in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not marking the vehicles as taxis or missing a taximeter.
The court issued a pre-trial order banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta Va<0xC5><0x88>ková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber in Brno work.
According to later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
Now he will return on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too buoyant celebration in Brno: a flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of the apartment building on Saturday evening in Brno and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a pedestrian who immediately called the officers.
Immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which there was still a chair, and beside it several cans and cigarette butts.
"The movement from the room on the fourth floor indicated that there was a rather noisy celebration going on inside.
Officers walked down the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between 26 and 29, for an explanation," police spokesman Jakub Ghanem said.
Request for appeal of Rafaj will be discussed by Babi<0xC5><0xA1> with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) plans on Monday to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats a request for a proposal to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS) Petr Rafaj.
Non-profit organizations called for the appeal of Rafaj at the meeting of the anti-corruption council of the government and the <0xC3><0x9A>stí Region.
The Social Democrats say an exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to CTK Rafaj, he was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, he cannot be appointed a third time by law.
His impeachment is the responsibility of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman.
In addition to the appeal of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the <0xC3><0x9A>stí Region.
The reason for this is, among other things, Rafa's recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister declined to comment on the request, saying he would get acquainted with the materials and that the government parties would take "some position" on the matter.
He also said that he has not yet negotiated with the president and has no meeting with him in the near future.
According to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
IHNED.cz and Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz reported last week that the police are interested in Rafaj’s meetings with Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
The meetings connected, among other things, with the decision on the competition for the controversial project of the new Zlín hospital for eight billion, which <0xC4><0x8C>unek strongly advocates.
<0xC4><0x8C>unek admitted meeting, according to him, together they dealt with his "senatial activities".
Raphael says the same.
The <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region's parliament called on the government to appeal against Rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the Office's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS regarding public procurement according to the Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened at the antitrust office over a toll tender.
This June, the server Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written to the company of influential behind-the-scenes player <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Alexander <0xC4><0x8C>uba.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been the chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, for a second term the president appointed the former social-democratic member in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafayev's second six-year term will expire.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the president may recall the head of the office on a proposal from the government.
He may be removed only if he has not been in office for more than six months or if he seriously impairs the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
Employees were collapsing in the Blansko library.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"That's good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blansko regularly.
In the warmer months, however, it was practically impossible to stand there.
It was hot and bad air.
The ventilation didn't help.
That’s why I like air conditioning,” said one of the readers from Blansko, Petr Novotn<0xC3><0xBD>.
According to the director of the library, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Dlapá, the temperatures in the building often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and works as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun leans into it for a large part of the day due to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual departments, because the windows must be closed overnight for safety reasons.
We often have this from the morning in the library to thirty degrees, "said Dlapa.
Worst of all was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And upstairs, the showroom and the principal's office.
Unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It happened several times that librarians collapsed at work and ended up incapacitated.
The problem also regularly occurred in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, you couldn't breathe there anymore," Dlapa remarked.
Initially, the city representatives wanted to make air conditioning in all the premises of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three out of five rounds.
“Due to limited funding, air conditioning will have only the most problematic spaces.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department are upstairs," said Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Svoboda from the Blansko investment department.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had already installed air conditioning in the above-mentioned premises last autumn and adjusted the wiring.
Approximately 360,000 crowns.
The City Library of Blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
Chicago's resistance has driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not all of the infected athletes come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, which is silent about the state of health of the players and does not disclose anything at all.
He was one of the few to step out of the Crawford line.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal was present only at the first training session, since then he was missing in the line-up.
“I would like to inform all of you that I have tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last fourteen days locked up in my home,” he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about their health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into full swing.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do my best to get back in shape as soon as possible,” he added.
The experienced goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a fixed part of the goalpost is already the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks will face St. Louis in a pre-match duel before facing Edmonton.
Thousands protest against Prime Minister in Israel
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deals with the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu’s resignation because of the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and because of how the government is handling the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the demonstrators wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the Emperor has lost his clothes," read another.
Netanyahu, 70, is the first Israeli prime minister to be tried in office.
He is charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He denies the allegations and describes them as a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial could take up to three years, with more than 300 witnesses summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
455 people died due to the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped reduce the daily increase in infections.
After the gradual easing of restrictions since the end of April, the number of infected people began to increase significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu’s critics argue that the government has not helped enough, for example, the entrepreneurs affected by the quarantine measures.
The protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing contradictory instructions in the context of the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver crashed his car into a tree and died.
The body had to be removed from the wreckage by firefighters.
The tragic accident occurred around 23:00 near Neveklov in a narrow district leading from the Slapy Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at no small speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be rescued from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things, they cut off the roof.
Circumstances of the accident are being investigated by police.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and squandering one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change of strategy.
He cancels discounts and no longer wants to throw one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
The view of slow fashion, often a despised approach to dress, has been changing quite rapidly in recent years.
About half of the goods Pietro Filipi sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, simply does not buy.
The company does not want to throw out one collection after another and at the end of each season, products are cheaper than their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the era of new and old collections and blindly following rapidly changing fashion trends is over.
"Most traders already count on discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it is actually a bit of a scam," says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
In addition, with its approach, the company wants to support local businesses.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and off-season.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands without any discounts is typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," adds Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Giant graffiti presents RAF pilot Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something to commemorate the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city management liked the proposal," said Vacek, who finished his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
It consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-<0xC5><0xA0>anov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis dragged him to a detention camp, where they held him for several weeks.
He and his brother, however, managed to escape the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig moved to the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in South Rhodesia, Africa, and Palestine.
He became involved in combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, known as Camo in the street art industry, has been working in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started his graffiti work on the areas set aside for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Hurricane Hanna hits Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna hit the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon.
It struck the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and faded into a tropical storm as it moved over the mainland.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, were reported.
On Saturday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared 32 counties in southwest Texas a state of natural disaster and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was given to people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the element is expected to hit an area almost 500 kilometers long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rains and winds, surface rises, dangerous surges and isolated tornadoes may pose a threat," the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in a statement.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST) the storm was moving in the area of the US-Mexico border, accompanied by winds at a speed of 85 kilometers per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, which gradually weakened as it progressed to land to 112 kilometers per hour, which again excluded Hanna from the category of hurricanes.
Authorities have urged local residents to stay home from the storm, not forgetting the sanitary measures associated with preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the U.S. states most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing security measures and the need to respect the distances, evacuations are also a big challenge.
Temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to bring masks and disinfectant gels to the shelter if possible.
"We're not far behind yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding," said Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts suggest that in some places up to 300 millimetres of rainfall could fall in a matter of hours, in some cases as much as 500 millimetres, which together with rising sea levels could flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman will lend the rank of general to Colonel Lipko
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman will lend the rank of general to Colonel Pavel Lipko on Wednesday.
This is according to an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for the award of the rank of Brigadier General is Lipka’s August ascension to the post of deputy commander of the Allied Multinational Division Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as the deputy commander of the Czech Army ground forces.
Zeman’s promotion was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel <0xC5><0x98>ehka as deputy commander of the multinational division north-east in Elblag, Poland, which commands the Allied forward presence in Poland and the Baltics.
In March, <0xC5><0x98>ehka became the director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (N<0xC3><0x9A>KIB).
The government proposed to the president to lend Lipko the rank of brigadier general.
According to the Act on Occupational Soldiers, a higher rank may be awarded to a soldier for the duration of his elected office or for the duration of his duty, which requires the award of a higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of the Allied division corresponds to the rank of general.
A soldier to whom the rank has been conferred shall have the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to an adjustment of salary that corresponds to the rank.
The award of the rank shall continue until the reason for which it was granted to him has ceased.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
It plays an important role in fulfilling the tasks of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defense said in June.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. at the Prague Castle, attended by Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar and Chief of General Staff Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus aviation standards
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the observance of the distance or wearing of masks in the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry said the agreement had been signed by officials and had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover one's mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to observe the recommended distance at security checks and check-in at the airport.
Aircraft must also be provided with sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials shall meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Differences in standards have caused confusion.
In the Arctic Svalbard fell temperature record, measured there almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has been broken in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, which exceeded the record of 1979 by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Svalbard, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbards are warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers of warming in other parts of the Arctic, from Alaska to Siberia, according to last year’s report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could rise ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.
Increasing temperatures in the Svalbards can cause permanently frozen soil to melt, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads and airports, and causing more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which are dependent on ocean ice sheets.
UK citizens returning from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British government has also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential routes to mainland Spain because of the risk of spreading COVID-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
“Protection of public health is our top priority.
"We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK," the British Foreign Office said in a statement.
“We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list,” she said.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The UK is also concerned about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a ten-day vacation to Lanzarote, where they were due to leave on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
“We were going to have the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don’t know what’s going to happen.
“I work as a train driver and I don’t think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks when I return from vacation,” he said.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, more than 900 new infections have been reported every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to restrict all nightlife to prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The model of buying electricity from Dukovan will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for buying electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill envisages that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power electricity is the unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek (for ANO) and the energy company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as developments in the past have shown several times.
The idea has been criticized by environmental groups.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
Thus, the final impact at the time of the rule’s applicability can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the materials.
Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people at the Dukovan construction site to make money.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people annually pay in electricity invoices to support the so-called supported sources.
He had previously estimated that the buyout price could range from 50 to 60 euros (about CZK 1,320 to CZK 1,600) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal of the amount, it should be included only in the purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders are now most stocked, is currently around 45 euros (about CZK 1,190) per MWh.
"With a difference in the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, it could make a surcharge to an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to a four-member household, standardly equipped with electrical appliances, including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and heating of hot water.
“We are living in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a purely speculative matter,” said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Voltr, Executive Director of the Energy Financial Group.
The proposed law envisages that the redemption would be carried out by the IPO, or a legally authorised entity owned by the State, at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension for ten years, even repeated, but no longer until the closure of low-carbon production.
It defines a low-carbon power plant as a power plant with a nuclear reactor connected to a power grid with an installed capacity of a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek previously said that the new Dukován block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The model of financing the new Dukovany block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state without interest during construction, with a 2% interest rate calculated for operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany would be built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should be 70% involved in the construction.
The rest should be paid by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Bene<0xC5><0xA1> said in May that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately CZK 162 billion).
Agreements between the state and CEZ on the construction of a new Dukovany block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development has downloaded the material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
The material, according to which the Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic, the Office withdrew from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for YES) of the server SeznamZpravy.cz said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was highlighted on Friday by the server Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry justified the plan by the decline in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, revenues and the media declined.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the state agency for the promotion of tourism CzechTourism for advertising on television, radio, press, on the Internet, billboards or areas at railway stations.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would go to television.
The majority would go to Nova and Prima private TV.
Printed newspapers and weeklies would receive $400 million, and the same amount would be given to MMR for PR articles, advertising banners, and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive $350 million for the media campaign, most of which would be private broadcasters.
The remaining $150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens, and surfaces at train stations or in the subway.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is certainly not in the form that should be presented," Dostalová said without further details to SeznamReporty.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this showy contempt will get a blow between the eyes in the autumn election," she wrote on Twitter.
Dostalová denies that it is actually about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support at all," she told the Daily Mail on Friday.
According to him, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we are still counting, it can be less and more.
“It’s work material,” she added.
The initiative Save Tourism does not make sense for a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Bar<0xC4><0x8D>ík, chairman of the initiative, said on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should go to companies, not to the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
A broth of life, a beer cock, and death like a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album entitled A smrt is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, a tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, who also left a year ago, on May 24th.
In Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s discography, he is the fifth item and, as with previous titles, the main emphasis is on Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s poetry, of which he is himself an excellent performer.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but he lived this inspiration through his own, individually presented experiences and also very inner manifestations of faith.
However, he was far from any agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradní<0xC4><0x8D>ek), the masters will forgive.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klí<0xC4><0x8D> or Honza Barto<0xC5><0x88> and Vít<0xC4><0x9B>zslav Holata.
I will help myself - I like - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka about Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s long poems.
"She laughed with pride and endless bitterness," writes Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka, "over the state of our endangered world.
The world, which is increasingly sinking into dull consumerism and greed, is increasingly distancing itself from what its soul was made of – the mystery of faith, humility and human intimacy.
There was a longing in them for one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest to anyone, but who also knows that it is only out of general indifference that one cannot renounce them.
The poems reminded us that we may have to lose everything dear, but it is not irrelevant how we lose it.
If he sells himself to the general decline, he resigns skeptically, he shuts up in fear, or he remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves.
Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamacek said
Former Czechoslovak Prime Minister Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek is not a paid social democracy adviser.
Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, the party’s chairman and interior minister, only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek said this on the Prima Party television program today.
On Friday, the server SeznamZpavy.cz reported that Paroubek should be Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s adviser.
"We text each other from time to time, he sends me material from time to time, and I read it," Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek said today.
He added that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
He believes that the CSSD has no means to waste them for similar purposes.
"There are a lot of people like that when I read his opinion from time to time," he said.
In a follow-up discussion with ODS deputy Jana <0xC4><0x8C>ernochová, the minister said that many ODS members are still "openly listening to the views of Václav Klaus".
According to him, this is okay, because he is an experienced politician and a former party leader, which is also the case of Paroubko.
The fact that the media are making an affair out of it is a sign of this year's cucumber season.
On Friday, the server SeznamZpawy.cz wrote that Paroubek is acting as Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth place of the party’s candidate in the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region is headed by the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and acted as the vice-chairman of his party, LEV 21.
Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, complains Swede's challenger
The 22-year-old American poleman has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, two years younger, last year he defeated him at a meeting of the NCAA universities.
“We had a battle a year before, he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since shot up steeply and is now alone in the highest pole-shaped realms.
In just twenty years, he became the world record holder, this year on February 8 in Torun he surpassed the ladder of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
"He jumped six metres at the age of 18 when he finished high school," Nilsen told the World Athletics website.
“It was clear that once he grew from a boy to a man, he would multiply his potential and talent tenfold.
“Twenty years is a good time to set a world record,” he said.
Although Nilsen’s list of achievements is much thinner than the one Duplantis prides itself on, the American sets similar goals.
So far, he has indicated his options at NCAA races, which he regularly won, this February at one of them he improved his internal personal record at 5.93 m. Last August, he won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he made his way to the US expedition to the world championship, where he finished 13.
The nearest milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because that's where you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead at events like the Olympics, the World Cup or the Pan American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, giving Nilsen and other stickers time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five circles into a mere duel for silver?
"Everybody's trying to catch up with him, but I don't think that's going to be possible anytime soon," Nilsen said.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile head start in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he will want to increase it even more.
A woman has spent hundreds of thousands on her disabled son's pension.
She is awaiting trial
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as an invalidity pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
For embezzlement, the woman faces up to eight years in prison.
Due to his poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his rights and appointed his mother as a guardian, who was also to manage his son’s money.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, the woman used part of her son's disability pension funds for her own use, depriving him of CZK 440,000," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman had a special duty as a guardian to protect the interests of the injured party.
According to the court order, the woman opened an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her own account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of her son in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of a car, electrical appliances and for the operation of the household," the indictment says.
That he could not use his son's money for his own needs, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping them pay for their family expenses.
"We had problems with our incomes tightening the course of the household.
We've never bought anything above-standard.
It was always about things that my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I didn’t know I was committing a crime,” the woman explained to the police.
He promised to return the money to his son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, say scientists after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spears or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the instruments date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here,” said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitude, has been inhabited for 20,000 years.
A widely accepted theory so far has suggested that the first representatives of Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this Clovis culture subsequently spread across much of North America.
This model, however, got cracked in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, reports on 42 different locations across North America that prove human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them were able to get to America by boat.
"It is clear that humans were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada.
Interest in tickets is still fulfilling an optimistic scenario, the sellers say.
Prices are also gradually decreasing.
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still about half, but demand is growing by as much as 20 percent every week.
According to the sellers, the development after the crisis is fulfilling the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually decreasing.
Among the most sought-after destinations, according to sellers, are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz, flights to Split, Croatia, are the most sold.
Of the other countries, the most sought after is the United Kingdom, which has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also decreasing.
At the Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz portal, around the middle of the month, it was around CZK 6,250, compared to CZK 3,000 less annually.
This is mainly due to the increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices in some European locations, such as Spain or Italy, have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers, who are now buying tickets much less ahead of schedule than before, because they are afraid of further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to Kiwi.com, the time it takes to buy a flight before departure has decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
“This confirms the future trend, where people will order tickets much less in advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk,” said Michal <0xC5><0xA0>indelá<0xC5><0x99>, vice president of Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth of sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Prague Airport currently operates regular services to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last year’s summer season, this is about half of the destinations.

The 26-year-old shooter first surprisingly knocked out the world six Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle overwhelmed Joe Cullen and in the quarter-finals after a sharp start even defeated Adrian Lewis.
The semi-finals were a big test.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the beginning, but in a calmly playing Belgian then an excellent series gained a lead, which then more or less without problems held to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which caused occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
Coronavirus cases increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been confirmed infected with it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, 5,254 people are sick.
This is according to the data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times two hundred.
There were 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive tests on Thursday, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first day of the week, 169 people were infected.
9,590 people have been cured of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all infected so far.
In most cases, the disease was mild.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with the coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of whom are assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days in terms of per 100,000 inhabitants still shows Karvinsko, almost 59.
It is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dek-Místek with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infections in the Czech Republic, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in place since Saturday.
People have to wear masks at indoor mass events over 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced by half from the current thousand people.
The number of people infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million worldwide.
According to Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
The death toll from Covid-19 is close to 645,000, according to the report.
The latest one million infected was added to the statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on July 22.
The largest share of the rapid increase in the number of cases in recent days was the United States, which has already registered more than 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where, according to the authorities, almost 1.4 million people have been infected.
The number of infected is now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization said this week that there were more than 284,000 new cases worldwide between Thursday and Friday, the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in densely populated states such as the United States, Brazil and India, but the number of new cases has increased in almost 40 countries around the world over the past week, according to Reuters.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially reported today by the DPRK.
The air in homes is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Health harms air fresheners and deodorants
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who helped create Israel’s Ministry of the Environment, the focus should be on household pollutants now that many people spend more time working from home.
According to research by the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA), indoor air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
“Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and still forces many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it’s time to focus on home air quality,” she said.
In Israel, almost no one is concerned with the quality of the “domestic air”.
Dangerous can be things that a person normally comes into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners also emit poisonous gas," Abraham said.
The most at risk are children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems.
Even otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer problems such as headaches, fainting, irritability of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
Not all pollutants come from objects inside the home, but the material from which the homes are built can be a source.
Quiz about Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost the chance to advance to the top Spanish football league due to the coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition canceled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada reported another 12 people infected on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive COVID-19 tests at the club to 28.
Due to the infection in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruna was postponed, in which it was enough for Fuenlabrada to get to the playoffs.
The management of the competition said today that the duel against La Coruna was definitively cancelled due to a higher power due to the fact that it was never played again.
Fuenlabrada made the decision.
On the contrary, La Coruña rebels against the failure of the match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save them, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not take place as usual complete in a single date.
The leadership of the former elite Spanish club is threatened by a court for falling into the third league.
The first two teams of the Huesca and Cádiz table are confident of progress between the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will face off for the remaining third place.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
Dominica's Daughter Reveals It
"Dad didn't have to do it for many years," Gotta's eldest daughter, Dominika, told Aha!, saying that the Master couldn't figure out Havel's name, and that whenever the word came to him, Karl was always angry.
It’s hard to say what they did, but according to Dominica, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
“My dad said in a post-revolution article that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in a drawer in the dark, but if he somehow resisted, then his career was over," says Gottová.
But then he adds that in the end the Czech greats have found their way to each other.
"I know that the word Havel could not have been heard until he was sixty.
But then the president congratulated him with a birthday letter, and suddenly my dad’s relationship with him began to change,” Dominika recalls.
In fact, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where a new era of their relationship began, because Mr. Havel's dad regularly invited him to his Bertramka home," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík was also saddened that he had never received a state decoration from Václav Havel.
After all, he received it in 2009, although it was already at the hands of his successor in the position of Václav Klaus (79).
In memoriam, the current President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, 75, will be awarded the Order of the White Lion to honor his memory.
