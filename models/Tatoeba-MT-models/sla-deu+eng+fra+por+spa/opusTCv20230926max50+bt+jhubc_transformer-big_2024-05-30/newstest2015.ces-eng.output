Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech: Transfer at the last minute?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance comes in the winter.
Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, currently Chelsea's substitute goalkeeper, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
Sitting at the NH Hotel in Smíchov, he talks to Czech journalists and is preparing to meet the Czech national team for the game general with the Americans and subsequently for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea, Thibaut Courtois takes the lead in the Premier League for the first time in ten years at a London club.
It has been speculated for some time that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup to Athletic at the start of the season and failed to make it into the league season when he lost 2-4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
St. Etienne scored 5–0 on Sunday, with two wins and two draws.
Relatively the most pushing shoe club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 in the league so far and broke up with Lille 1-1 amicably over the weekend.
English tabloid websites have reported that they might want the Czech in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, <0xC4><0x8C>ech’s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet gave him a 4:1 rate.
Peter, is it possible that in the remaining few hours you will change your jersey?
I'm not counting on it, but there's never anything 100% in football.
Perhaps during the day there will be an offer that can not be refused.
What would such an offer look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know what an offer that can't be turned down actually looks like.
First of all, it would depend on the position of Chelsea, whether he would deal with the possible offer of the club or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Would it not be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new location?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation there are a lot of players today, they are all somewhere in the national teams and I am sure a lot of transfers will be closed today.
Somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet can afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pressuring me to leave?
The situation where I did not catch a new season in the first three games is new for me after fifteen years of career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
"I want to continue to take part in this fight for Chelsea's goalkeeper position and it is up to the coach who he chooses and what decisions he makes in the coming weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, the sporting aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, which, of course, belongs to the needs of the family.
Is it possible that you would catch for another club in England?
This is a question that I thought would never concern me.
In football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, on his first major visit since the May election victory to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world’s third-largest economy.
The list includes, first and foremost, plans for greater cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to the reporters, India also hopes that the two nations will agree on cooperation on defense issues.
Police in Karratha arrested a 20-year-old man after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it ran 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and drove into a bush to escape the police.
In the morning, traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle at the edge of the road when they noticed that it was driving 125 km/h when leaving the petrol station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued down Burgess Road and then turned into a bush, so the police lost sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were then spotted in a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karratha police have accused the 20-year-old of disobeying a call to stop and reckless handling.
He will stand trial in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in Nairn and Pitlochry hotels
A man has been charged with raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the indictment during a hearing at the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
According to the statement, Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent."
Webster is also being prosecuted for the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set the date for her trial as Nov. 17 at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to protect union organization as a civil right.
“The way unions work is the way middle-class jobs work,” says Ellison, a Democratic senator in Minnesota who is co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to present, along with John Lewis's model of occasional rights, a law that empowers employees.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in organizing unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-union forces
Adjusting the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination, if they want to join a trade union, to go to civil court - and to sue for compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other lawmakers are proposing is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states – Americans once encouraged countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, included language in them, and openly acknowledged that “the right of employees to assemble, collectively negotiate, and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Realizing that workers would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, the Germans included a clause that openly states: “The right to form associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Agreements that limit this right or seek to infringe it will be terminated. Measures leading to the fulfillment of such purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a universal treaty, it included the petitioners and Roosevelt’s guarantee that “everyone has the right to form and join trade unions to protect their interests.”
For generations, Americans have embraced the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to form labor unions – and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as equal partners – must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the trade unions have not diminished the power of the nation, but have expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an unimaginable level.
Those who attack the trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - has been very delayed.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that elevated America and made it a real promise of democracy.
A judge has temporarily blocked a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers say would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
A decree enacted by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, due to enter into force on September 1, would require abortion doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions temporarily and must obtain this permit in the meantime.
"The nominating party will be able to legally conduct its business and in the meantime obtain permission," federal judge John deGravelles said in a ruling.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent order on the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, and said it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from a devious law designed to deprive them of their health and rights,” Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applies to doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and they are also requesting this permission.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have enacted similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional by provision.
Key parts of the Texas law that would shut down most of the state's remaining clinics were blocked by federal judges on Friday.
Women’s abortion rights activists, along with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have such a permit places requirements on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion have argued that the measures are aimed at protecting women’s health, and some have also welcomed the fact that the clinics would be closed due to the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said only one abortion doctor in Louisiana is licensed.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said they would not penalize doctors who perform abortions while they wait for a rights request to be processed.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in the countryside
Angelina Jolie and her brother, James, released a video to pay tribute to their deceased mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their urban counterparts.
The researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the women over seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by women’s age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rates were found in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says the factors may be a late diagnosis and poor access to treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynecologists who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite improvements in remote medical services to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transportation services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, Elisha Neave, a young mother from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the reduction in the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with an extraordinary decline in homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that by the time today’s younger generation of consumers reach “the main age group of gardeners”, garden centers will lose up to <0xC2><0xA3>10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent homes spend an average of 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own homes.
As other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front yards used as parking space, and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where home ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% over a six-year period, household spending on horticultural products is the lowest in the UK.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said that sublet housing or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening consultant for the RHS, said: “It’s very popular with tenants to grow plants in pots – when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales for this year due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin, at the meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me most of the Hitler Youth, saved with atomic weapons and basically showed everyone that his views are stolen from him, he gave us today a lecture on democracy.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both intense nationalism and that they can transform the inferiority complex into imperialistic lusts.
Time passes differently in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars for dominance over Europe was long over, in the East, on the contrary, it thought that they had been overlooked for a long time and it was necessary to regain its international position.
Such a mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, and then followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike the current situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the liquidation of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that is quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and certainly a large part of the Russians probably miss the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled in front of them.
Perhaps the Western politicians blamed themselves, maybe they patted Vladimir on the shoulders a little, maybe they didn’t invite him where he wanted to go, maybe they started to underestimate him and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He put his house in order, pretending that he didn't really want to go anywhere, and grinding knives at home.
Now he has decided to regain his lost position.
He'll start slowly, he's got time.
The leader's probably in for life, so he's in a hurry.
He trampled on the Caucasians, now he tramples on the Ukrainians, then the dwarves from the Baltics are next.
They've been pinching the Russian bear in the fur for a long time.
I am sure that China will notice this, too, which somehow jumps out too much and is certainly making a trip to the Far East.
And those Germans are pretty pissed off about Vladimir, too, how well they're doing, and we put that on their ass at 45.
How about a new Novorossiya in Karlovy Vary?
That would be a base, and there are a lot of ours, and as they oppress them, they wanted to demolish many of them.
After all, our veterans will still remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, their Prime Minister Mr. Sobotka, he is so soft, can be peeled like an onion and eat the whole EU.
It would be a good thing if they jumped on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded of their place.
And as detonators, we'll use our fellow tribesmen who live in their territory.
There are plenty of Russians everywhere, and if they are said to be oppressed there, they are simply oppressed there, and we will not let that happen, we will protect them.
And the Russians will rule again, because they were born for something else.
After all, Europe is only good as a prelude, on which the proud Ivan can dance Cossack.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over spy report
Turkey's foreign minister has summoned the country's highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British espionage activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US charge d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept said that according to documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report and said that all major states are watching each other.
An earlier report, according to which the German intelligence service also targeted Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones Showcases Fourth Season Tricks
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted of how the tricks of the fourth series were created.
The most visible are computer adaptations of the serial environment and mass scenes, when a crowd of soldiers turns into a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Director Accused of Corruption
Complainants on Friday presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and state officials at the Calvia municipality to the Mallorcan state prosecutor's office.
A police chief in Calvia, on the holiday island of Mallorca, has been arrested after allegations were made by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street that houses most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, on Friday, complainants presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and civil servants at a city hall in the Calvia municipality to the public prosecutor’s office for the fight against corruption.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police on corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spain’s national daily ABC quoted dissatisfied night business owners as saying that public officials’ favors had serious impacts on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one businessman told the court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist who gave oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour appeared on YouTube.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to keep an eye on drunks and rioters in the ranks of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcoholic bar tours.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organizers of the Carnage bar tour, paid a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-induced accidents, including a fashionable wave known as “balconing”, in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms that affected the flight at the Adelaide airport
SPRING brought an icy surprise to the south of South Australia, with heavy rains and strong winds that severely hit Adelaide airport.
Another 5 mm of rainfall is expected to fall in the city until 9 p.m. and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain came along with a few short thunderstorm-related rainstorms and gusts of wind that started before eight o’clock in the evening and produced nearly 4 mm of rain in about ten minutes.
After several early doses of spring came after the winter last week, temperatures in the city fell again to just 15.8 °C on Monday.
It is believed that the stormy weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m. but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at the Adelaide airport at the time reached speeds of about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop off from the second landing and eventually landed at about 20:40.
The plane’s delay subsequently caused other flights to be delayed, including Emirates’ flight from Dubai and Qantas’ flight from Sydney.
According to the forecast, temperatures in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 ° C on Tuesday, and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, but schools in Gaza remain closed as the territory recovers from fighting.
The beginning of the school brought to communities in the south of Israel marked by attacks a sense of joy and excitement, but signs of fighting are still noticeable.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, workers at a rocket-hit kindergarten have removed fragments from the wall and are slowly waiting for the children to return.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Saad kibbutz and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it was "a little strange" to suddenly go back to school.
"We've had some hard times, and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibbutz, close to the Gaza border, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support.
Until the ceasefire last week ended, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad stayed inside their homes or fled their homes to safer areas farther from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian mortar shell killed a four-year-old boy, hesitate to return.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families still did not return.
Their children were temporarily placed in secondary schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that has been hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He urged children to study diligently, adding: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on Tuesday to an indefinite peace agreement.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not resolve key issues such as Hamas’ demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen Gaza’s airports and ports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other militants from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities in the south of the country during the fighting.
The Israeli military has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in a hundred UN schools that have been transformed into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding and the ongoing fighting, school officials delayed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education just like the Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza’s largest city.
Willow at the meeting: I stand behind Vacha.
And Lafata is worried about the temperature
The Czech national football team met before midday in Prague before Wednesday's preparation match with the United States and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualification against the Netherlands.
From the 23-member squad has problems Spartan striker David Lafata, who is troubled by the temperature.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David still has some problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it's two or three days, or if he's fit tomorrow, that's going to depend on his medical condition, which will be decided by our doctor," he said.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some kind of pain, but it's not that they could not train or participate in the match on Wednesday with the United States," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Vách as the last player of the Spartan midfielder.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision to make, and other midfielders were also considered.
I decided on the basis that Luká<0xC5><0xA1> is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand by it," Vrba said to Vách.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Lattata.
It is not excluded that in case of health problems, the nomination could still be changed.
On the weekend, for example, Liberec’s Josef <0xC5><0xA0>ural, who gave a hattrick, shone with a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown form.
We'll see how David Lafata does.
In case he will not be available on Wednesday, I am not saying that I can not nominate any of the players who became interested in the Czech league, "said Vrba.
This afternoon, the national team is waiting for training in Strahov, and on Tuesday, the classic pre-match training before the duel with the USA in Letná, which will be open to fans, followed by an autograph show.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will strive for the premiere victory under Vrba.
In the previous three pre-matches, he played two draws and lost one.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9 at 8:45 p.m.
Walking to the Netherlands in Italy
Vrba is glad that, unlike previous meetings, he has more time for training.
It’s an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we didn’t have that much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing for the Netherlands in the best possible way," Vrba praised himself.
The Dutch will present themselves before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will be personally watched by former interim national coach Josef Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice.
He'll give us information about the match.
But it won't be just about him, we'll have the fight filmed and we'll discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," Vrba told the bronze medalists from the recent World Cup.
According to highly monitored statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter period have increased the most in the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital, Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase resulted in an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase for the winter months since 2007.
Annual price increases climbed to 10.9 percent, more than doubling in one year until August 2013, but profits were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
RP figures Data show that housing prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
The other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price increases averaged between 5% and 6%.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was damaged by state-ordered spending cuts and where prices increased by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the continuing high rate of auction sales, the generally high sales rate and the low interest rate, it is likely that the value of housing will increase further over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said to me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
They had a cooler relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in a factory.
Henry is rehearsing the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melody is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to deal with a few unpleasant childhood memories.
After the death of his mother, Henry underwent "in-depth" therapy, and now he is thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You’ve never seen his face, you’ve only heard his voice: “Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton — when I was a kid, they were adults — they used to go to a bar with him and discuss things like the shape of a beer jar or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I never talked to him like that.
For most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Henry had recently visited the Dudley foundry, and although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he had taken a glimpse of what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light today, but it's still a dark, smokey, gloomy labyrinth where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got into the tub and just lay there, then you could hear him singing to himself slowly, because he was washing the foundry off.
As I walked by, I realized that he had been doing this for years to feed his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry lived his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, didn't say, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mom was sick and dying that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you" thing?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
They are still good friends with French, whom he has been married to for 25 years.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes started to show, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to a great fitness center and I also had to follow a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat carrots alone.
The change in direction of taking Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-haired beard.
After receiving acclaim from critics for his Othello, he plunged into the theater.
This was followed by a comedy full of mistakes and August Wilson's Fences.
It’s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ spotted him on stage parodiing someone and wrote about him in the talent contest New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time I was the only black imitator/comedian on television."
He was learning on the go.
Besides being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985, I had to learn how to make jokes that worked, how to be a star and how to act on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed up as blacks, Henry eventually starred in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was already upset about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on the big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “years and years acclaimed as a major product of British television,” but was also “a grotesque parody of blacks.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters that both ridiculed and glorified British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was best known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
He spent the next decade in commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in films, but after broadcasting his series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, because it looks a little bit like you're stuck in one place, or you're getting a little out of the way."
Next up was a radio 4 documentary called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was very allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't learn it properly in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of that.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try."
Don't bother if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry gave twenty lines of Othello's closing speech for the documentary, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
"That's what it's about. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the rehearsal was tough, and before that I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which did not happen.
Soon he began to play in a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical fault, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for capturing the audience.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before they fix the computer, you have to keep them entertained for ten minutes.’”
Instead, the theatrical director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can take care of it for me.
"You play, so stay in the role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Fences was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it’s like a god’s sign saying, “This is what you should be doing.”
Of course, he says it in a loud voice.
So I'm sticking to it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Henry still has the brain of a comedian - all the time our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and exits the role of an imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you are always looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not as happy as I used to be.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps outline the beginning, the middle, and the end of the road - I don't think I'd ever want to give up on that.
So your new incarnation?
Yeah, I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to illuminate non-existent employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government’s payroll.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer receive pay.
The government believes that thousands of people are being paid even after they left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to prevent corruption in the state administration.
An audit conducted this year showed that the state is losing at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month on salaries of non-existent employees and other abuses of authority.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts after the employee’s death or after the employee leaves the government, a BBC reporter from Nairobi’s capital, Wanyama Chebusiri, said.
All state officials must report to the identification centers within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government said in a statement.
He further says that anyone who fails to show up without an apology will be removed from the payroll.
“By identifying actual public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clear payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for ‘conspiracy’ against government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government”.
Police have not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were among the detainees.
Some of them were involved in a corruption investigation in December that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and phone tapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then prime minister) described their actions as part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1st.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatsenyuk’s daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving teachers flowers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for hard times
It carries with it clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience on the front lines.
She started her career at Bain & Co, then went on to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when her junior colleague took over the top position at the parent company, Pearson's.
It's been said that her severance pay was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the government office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's job as a cup of poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and intricate entity at the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inward to the top layer of the BBC’s own leadership hierarchy, but also outward to the public’s voice in times of turmoil when things don’t work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires thorough reform.
But which director would risk coming into a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, dismantling it and thus taking his own job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it weren’t so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink – its power, its finances – and its status being revised.
As competition expands and new technology challenges old assurances, the immediate negotiation of royalties for the BBC carries a great danger.
For a modest <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in what is arguably the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that 96% of households produce it, costing only 40p a day each.
In addition, the popularity of the BBC is clearly rising: to 53 percent of supporters, up from 31 percent ten years ago.
The patterns of using BBC services have changed: Today, the headlines appear on my mobile phone, and I can watch the shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to be a very beloved and amazing institution.
She needs an amazing director -- I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry Says He Didn't Approve the Tweet
The tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry’s official Twitter account, which was posted on Sunday, contained an insulting image of a Democratic prosecutor who initiated criminal charges against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another tweet was posted on Perry's account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet that was not authorized has left my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and have withdrawn it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't respond to the query messages right away.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for its administration.
The previous tweet posted an unflattering, humorous image of Attorney General Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay funds for her office, which brought Perry, a possible presidential candidate in the 2016 election, before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet said: “I don’t always drive with a blood alcohol level three times higher than the permitted limit... but if I do, I’ll sue Governor Perry for holding me accountable.”
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry wasn't led by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who had been appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the accusation a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because using the laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut off payments of $7.5 million from the state fund for the Department of Public Interest Advocacy, which is based in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection sparked a formal complaint from a left-wing group of civic activists.
Perry’s official account is active – and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party’s committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might have finished by tweeting a picture of himself running by the lake and saying, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
Berkeley Says Housing Market Is Returning to 'Normal'
One of London’s most prominent developers warned that the housing market in southeast England had “returned” to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread fears of a credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to introduce mortgage caps in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley’s development company for demanding clients, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from its peak in 2013.”
The London housing market was doing well during the downturn, as foreign buyers flooded into the capital.
According to the cadastral office, prices in the city jumped 18.5% last year alone, far outpacing the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
The average selling price of Berkeley’s private, affordable and student housing rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening pounds have made them less attractive to foreign buyers of London real estate in recent months – some of them also intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible “sat tax” that politicians came up with ahead of next May’s parliamentary elections.
LONDON (Reuters) - London-based real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that an April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, would also slow down the growth rate of real estate and price sales over the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, lowered its forecast for 2015 to 3% as house prices began to fall.
In the meantime, the volume of transactions in London’s most expensive neighborhoods, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has decreased by a quarter each year, according to real estate agency WA Ellis.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley, as it increased cash for forward sales to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “Demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same, and this has kept forward sales going.”
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 properties between the beginning of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual profit before tax increased by 40% to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, revenues by 18% to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
On Monday, ahead of the company’s annual meeting, Pidgley said Berkeley’s annual revenues were projected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley's shares stalled at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
Hacker Posts Naked Photos of Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Academy Awards.
Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence’s photos have been leaked online because of a hacker who claimed to have a “list” of photos of hundreds of other aspiring actresses.
A spokesperson for the Hunger Games film star confirmed that Lawrence’s photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for “obvious privacy violations.”
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker photos, which were originally posted on the image-sharing server 4chan, reportedly obtained due to a gap in the iCloud repository system of Apple. The alleged list of photos hacked by victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It’s unclear how many of the photos are authentic, but the star of the film “Scott Pilgrim against the Rest of the World” Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
“I hope those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our home are happy with themselves,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from Nickolodeon's cable series "iCarly" and "Victorious", however, denied that the photos were genuine, tweeting: "These are my supposed nude photos, folks."
It's better to cut it off even in the cracks. *deliberate word play*.
Buzzfeed said on Sunday that pop star Ariana Grande's spokesperson denied the photos were real.
An extraordinary example from Howard Jacobson's praised new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually spreading out like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time a woman told him that he was too serious, too complex, too fierce, too isolated, and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He angrily admitted it.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was a beginning love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older companion whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited a property in a damp but beautiful valley called, conveniently, the Valley of Paradise.
No one has lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, the bathtubs were filled with dead spiders, the snails were sneaky signing on the windows as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge cabbage heads.
The house looked like a cottage of children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on folding chairs in the long grass and held hands, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning the public station, which supplied the region with comforting music and soothing news, when the sight of her tanned crossed legs long reminded him of his father's long-breasted legs.
Your legs are too big.
Due to their natural aggression, they did not play such songs on the radio anymore.
They weren't forbidden -- nothing was really forbidden -- they weren't playing.
They helped them get to desuetudo, as did the word desuetudo itself.
People’s taste has done things that regulations and outlaws would never do, and just as people choose memoirs when it comes to books, in which the poor man becomes a rich man, cookbooks and romance novels, so in music ballads are chosen.
Cavern was dragged by the day and began to play an imaginary piano, singing a serenade in a rough, comical voice to Aillin's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song from jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was little.
His father told him that he also played the game with his father.
If you didn't put two fingers in front of the word that started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny then, and it wasn't funny now.
He knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard of one.
Neither did jazz, even though it was not directly outlawed, they did not play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only one “if” in life.
When the melodies started playing, people wanted to know exactly where they would end up.
Same thing with humor.
His unpredictability annoyed people.
And jazz was the humour expressed by the song.
Although he hadn’t heard of Sammy Davis Jr. until he was ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father’s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least he didn't have to tell Aillin that Fats Waller was black.
Due to her age, she could not remember a time when the favorite singers were not black.
Without laws or coercion.
A permissive society is one in which every part of it with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who were fortunately spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution were used for fun and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature gifted for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family will not be without a functional phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed washed the dishes.
Those of the states of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country, while WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED - they were afraid that they would accuse them of putting them on the fire, in fact, they were afraid that the fire would not consume them the next time - they opened a restaurant where they smoked and smoked for water.
To each according to his talent.
As she listened only to the ballads, Ailinn found it hard to understand how the obscene words Kavern had just sung to her could make music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people with too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape behind the soundproof sheets.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief and overshadowed Kevern's view.
All over the world, nothing could be seen but the turmoil of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
Not the feet at all.
Maybe a little ankle...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate it?
No, I'm not.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" to her, but it was too soon.
"I'm attracted to your fat ankles right now," he tried.
I'm kind of freaky.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him in trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to tame the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe it was a deliberately cruel Cavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from the chair, knocked down the radio and spilled the undrinked wine.
It's a mustard wine, so it's not the drink.
She seemed to tremble in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm sickly attracted to you for being an asshole," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She hadn't spoken to him about living on the cold northern peninsula where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that in the foundations it was the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean was shaking against them.
The same confused men, after WHAT HAPPENED, even more insensitive and annoying than their forefathers, smugglers and swindlers, roamed angrily from pub to pub, ready to lay hands on any woman who dared to refuse them or laugh at them.
Stupid?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First cuddling her - cuddling became the most common expression for the erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote to the faint love ballads that the radio blew - first cuddling her, then punching her.
In Kevern's view, too much cultivation, because cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons insinuated him to leave.
He rose from the bed like an old man.
She felt annoyed, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him leave—as if she were watching him from a window upstairs—a man who had been chased by what he had caused.
Adam was leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was shattered for him and for all the men in general, even though a few had beaten her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders bent, embarrassed, defeated, all belligerence had left him - why did she think she knew that look well, even though she couldn't remember a single moment, until today, that she'd ever seen it again?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working at Ofnow, a non-statutory Public Mood monitoring system, prepared a short article about the persistence of light and moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where there was enough energy to mitigate or directly stop it.
"A lot has been done, and a lot remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggression of the people who have fought many battles and won most of them, especially in the jammed, hard-to-reach places of the country, where despite the tips of the church towers rising above the hedges, a touch of human benevolence was a mere discovery of history."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the impulses.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas old brutality holds as stubbornly as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that new brutality is not being discovered at home, in the workplace, on the roads and on the roads.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be overly floral," her supervisor said.
I would suggest that you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again challenged her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I don't ask," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I have anything against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We have no prejudice at this workplace.
We serve unbiased societies.
But some kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Apparently, you yourself are biased towards the church – things you call “cruel” and “brutal” could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural strength and energy.
Constantly addressing WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, preparing the earth with its basic life force.
As Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head was a pink gleam of recommendations that Ofnow had been broadcasting to the world for the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
“To speak is better than to be silent, the word sung is better than the written, but there is nothing better than love.”
"I fully understand your objections," said Esme Nussbaum quietly, as she was sure her superior was finished, "and I'm not suggesting that the wound didn't heal as we think it did.
My first concern is that if we are not warned of this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust onto others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined his fingertips.
This meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you describe the steps your grandparents may or may not have taken as mistakes.
You go too far in talking about them venting their “anger” and “distrust” on “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them.”
There was no “we” and there was no “they.”
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"During which, if we're honest with each other," Esme took courage, "we're no one to blame.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There is nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to be blamed, there are no things to be corrected, even if the correction is appropriate and possible.
But what is the use of the past except to learn from it?
The past exists to be forgotten.
If there's anything I can add to this --
Luther Rabinowitz disconnected his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said, releasing it.
The next day, as she was going to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hit the pavement in a way that passers-by described as “brutal and furious.”
Coincidences happen.
Kingdom of Lesotho Army Says No Coup Planned - Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Military officers in the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied orchestrating a coup to overthrow the government, claiming to have acted against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official headquarters and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After declaring that he was being threatened with death, the prime minister went with his family to neighboring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
“This morning, the Kingdom of Lesotho’s Defence Command acted after receiving several news reports that there are several groups in the ranks of the police who are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to make a landslide,” he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized government power by force, it appears that the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces bear the mark of a coup d'état," he said.
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and there was calm in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was targeted for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended the session of parliament due to internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He said that despite his claims, he did not undermine the government.
Eurozone production at 13-month low
Production growth slowed to a 13-month low in the euro area in August, according to a carefully monitored survey.
The final euro area purchasing managers index (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have run out and the factories have been damaged by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the eurozone’s delayed recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to the one the UK and the US joined during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the inhibition that a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty have on producers is increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s chief economist.
The production PMI of Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone’s second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has moved from expansion to stagnation.
"The signs that the driving force for growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The industry’s slowdown is likely to fuel analysts awaiting further monetary or tax stimulus.
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing we can say about the August purchasing managers’ production survey is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
“Manufacturers in the eurozone are currently having a very difficult life, as rising geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add to the ever-tougher conditions in many countries.
This growing uncertainty has proven to have affected trade - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially the costly ones.
He said that as “even more likely” it appears that the ECB will eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten Years of Hell Beslan Survivors: Ten Years of the Horrors of the Occupied School, Children Still Suffer
A decade ago, a thousand people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three days of suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocity at school
Exactly ten years after the horrific school siege in Beslan that killed 334 people, including 186 children, last night’s surviving heroes warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy united East and West, which in this catastrophic calamity led to action and the future.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, southern Russia, to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocity at school.
We found amazing young people who resisted misfortune, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will live on in them.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine – and in which children like them are dying – is over.
Girl trying to climb back into a ruined school gym
She was caught by leading Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov trying to get back into the bombed school gym after a bomb exploded in her underwear.
Confused, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, now in her forties.
There were fears that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were full of blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another operation.
There are bits of shrapnel left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly did not destroy it," she said resolutely.
“It just happened to me and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Jera Gapoeva was killed there.
When we were little, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I’ll think about family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten her captivity, but her memories fade a little bit every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet, climbing through the school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school at the age of seven) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At that time, the seven-year-old said, “My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing she was dead, he ran and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed the baby's hand, and ran with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
She said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara rode to freedom and lay in the hospital with a wounded leg and on the contrary thought that her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that the memories are fading.
I remember right after that I threw away all my playing guns.
But today I can play computer games that shoot, and I have no problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I used to play with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they've been killed or died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy store and how I drove a convertible.
But now he is worried about places like Ukraine, where the war is suffering as he and his friends have suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
“I feel sorry for everyone who has to go through such a horror,” said Damir, who volunteered at the convent last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work for the police one day, and I hope to be accepted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, there were no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it’s been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's appetite for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water pistol, and they were running and playing with him.
And it's only been a month since the horror.
I was surprised at how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up and is a nice and quiet boy, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and from time to time he goes to the gym and lights candles.
When he was younger, he had problems with it—I remember sometimes lying on the couch with his face turned away from us, sometimes lying there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his guns or other weapons to play with, and Damir is 17 today, taller than I am, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember shouting ‘Damir, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives go on unlike others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of terror in Beslan
Consolation: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, Grigory today
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was engraved in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocities in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take her elder son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists invaded the yard, so my little boy stayed there alone for three days,” she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it becomes more and more difficult to think about it and talk about it.
Not a day goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn’t seem like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
A picture of Grigori (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigori looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There is even a statue of Grigori in San Marino.
Grigori doesn't like to look at the photo, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think it's because of this picture that people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today Grigory says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Tragedies like this are still being investigated, but the truth will never be known.
They're investigating the plane crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
This world's about to do something really bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
Forget about it, it takes decades.
It affected my health, I still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of an attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why, as September 1st approaches, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
It was a miracle that he survived.
“It feels like yesterday,” said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service but could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've left behind.
Now I'm older, and it's said that children can handle bad experiences better - I have to say, that's not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and then I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I passed out.
I will never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I sit in that well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don’t like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as my physical health is concerned, I am fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt, but I can walk normally.
But still, for health reasons, I could not enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me it was not possible.
My other favorites are animals, so I went to the vet.
I finished my second year there.
He learns how to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about it.
It is not something that children should know about, and certainly not something that they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be there.
It's inside, and it's getting worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will attend the commemoration ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn’t help him.
I'm so thankful to God he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's a grown man today, but he's carrying the horror on.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He underwent several surgeries, can walk, but can not exercise.
I would say that 50% of the time you have overcome the horror, but you can not overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and loved.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me to lose those killed.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who did not remarry.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don’t want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's happening in the world -- wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is approaching our country now, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and throw them away - as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child who was taken to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyon Tskaev is transported to a safe Russian special commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, the world gasped for breath when little Alyona was carried out in her arms from the Beslan captivity by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, her 10-year-old sister Kristina, and her brother Makhar captive in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and with his new wife Svetlana they have a little girl named Kristina after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the attack and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said, “They’re a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep his children away from the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Man Accused of Knocking Down Girl at Sign Transition in Fife
An eighty-eight-year-old man stands trial for hitting a three-year-old girl while crossing a sign in the village of Fife.
Gordon Stewart reportedly hit the girl at the Pittenween crossing in East Neuk.
The plaintiffs allege that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the charges in Dundee.
Judge Charles Macnair has set the date of his hearing for January.
4 tips on how to take better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking photos or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is a compact, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which cost about $ 300.
I took these photos at a family party with a few cameras, all costing less than $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules to get the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly sealed.
Next, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only designed for up to 5 feet, others for up to 50 to 60 feet.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both normal and waterproof designs.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them will not work.
Compact cameras have an LCD to help you compose your photos, but outdoor cameras don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
Always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of images with slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of this.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dive, the light decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
It also allows you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you dive, the less colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is excellent advice if you are taking pictures on land, but underwater it is even more important because of the dim light.
This is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the subjects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality power was able to change things even in an organization as vast as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to alleviating the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that crippled him.
Lawson realized that while doctors focused on diagnoses and diseases, the vast majority of treated patients were interested in something else: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one who started to suffer.
"I don't feel myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with the symptoms of the flu and found himself impatient and embracing his wife Juliet with remorse.
He remarked, "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicablely upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague X-rayed his chest.
He had been skiing in the French Alps for two weeks.
X-ray results came in.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer smoked.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building fibrous material that was formerly referred to as "miraculous" but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation laymen, builders, carpenters, and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in industry in another era hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
Such complacency is not appropriate.
There is a mesothelioma epidemic in Britain today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma here is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year from this disease are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we feel its effects only now, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The mesothelioma disaster does not only affect construction industry veterans.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
Thus, mesothelioma does not respect social strata, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged bastions from London department stores to public schools do not constitute a shelter.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we are supposed to be treated are the repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put insulation.
He was trying to find out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It’s possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years practicing,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question that he was able to answer in part.
“Of the four doctors who have been practicing at Guy’s Hospital and who have developed mesothelioma over the past five years,” he noted in a 2010 letter, “I’m the only one still alive.”
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55 years old.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not common.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get the same disease?”
According to Professor Julian Pete, a leading British expert on mesothelioma, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them have no idea that they are going to die this way.
Asbestos Mine in Quebec, Canada
A snapshot of the files from the court archives, to which persons with disabilities often turn and demand a settlement, shows how much the mesotheliomic disaster has spread.
Marks & Spencer admitted in June that it had negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw the clothing section in two stores - one of the places was the flagship of the company, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today she has two children, who are over 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed it would concern me in any way.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
He got his name because of his fibrous structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is most commonly found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler gaskets and even in brake lining.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
An employee of Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pete points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient study states that “a substantial proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
Much of this exposure is due to the "common use and weathering" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that the service elevators and pipelines behind the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as harmless as a “strong airflow.”
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Directorate of Parliament’s Services insisted that the Palace of Westminster receive a “positive medical certificate”, it is now expected that it will take one million pounds and several years of work to thoroughly examine the Parliament, to modernize electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the elections in 2015 there will be MPs in the green benches of the Alkmaars in Westminster.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of asbestos does not comply with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Everyone can now just wait.
One of the people who have never been able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, is suspected of being exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was found,” he says, “but in my case, I can’t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something like a chill.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly I shuddered.
It came all at once.
I was awful.
I didn't think I'd get home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
Finally, he spent a month at home.
Confused, the doctors X-rayed his chest and inserted a chest catheter to remove the fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
They didn't make a diagnosis, though.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and came into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray scans with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera probe was inserted into the space between the chest lining and the lung lining.
I'm optimistic.
“I tend not to take much,” he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year: “I was told it was mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with sisters from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now starting to develop the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in the basement, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, staff members who crossed the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement canteens (like Graham Abbott often) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, decades after the war, hospitals were a place where patients could be saved, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos has been eliminated to this day.
Students built Bunsen’s kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools as well.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in myriad chemistry classes, students were building Bunsen’s khahan on an asbestos mat.
A website has been created dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
“This is an industrial poison embedded in a large number of homes,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman with mesothelioma could remember occurred in the 1970s when a garden house was torn down.
So be careful how you tear down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
“It takes a while to figure it out,” Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn’t concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
Like the countless patients before him, he remembers feeling confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?’
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking to myself, “Well, I won’t see another Christmas.
That's the way it is."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive – the very breathing – is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of small fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can trigger cell mutations.
“The problem is needle-shaped inhaled asbestos fibers,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and has treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during their hospital internships.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “breathing alone pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
It is invasive in nature from the very beginning.
On mesothelioma, the common treatment options used for other types of cancer do not work as well.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly debated.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “doesn’t respond very well to chemotherapy,” which “has some effect,” but doesn’t cure it.
“Sometimes there is someone who survives lung cancer,” says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After finding mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for people with the same disabilities.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself: "Hello, you've reached the cancer center."
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and would probably extend his life by only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I was going to give up.
Lawson, however, “was able to show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the chest surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called them and they ran me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application and they would have to approve a reimbursement.
For patients with mesothelioma, the question of money is key to getting the best treatment available.
But when various treatments inevitably fail, many patients face additional financial worries - about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're going to court and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health,” Morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was discovered that even very small amounts of it could pose a health risk.
This is where the company’s negligence comes into play.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan, it was not a "full settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a Guy’s Hospital spokesperson confirmed that “asbestos in the incriminated basement area was removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Blending exposure to deadly asbestos to one company or place of work – usually decades after it happened – has proven to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or gone bankrupt.
The insurance records are gone.
And those who are now defending themselves against the accusations have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation was adopted this year, making it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if their former employer is not traceable.
The law created a 350-million-dollar financial reserve, which is paid by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos, but have no one to sue.
In this case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally award them as compensation - approximately <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Each year, 300 applications are expected to be successfully processed.
Like mesothelioma patients, Andrew Morgan thinks <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is “good work.”
“It’s an agreement signed by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the amount is a quarter of what insurance companies would have had to pay if it hadn’t intervened in time, and people with mesothelioma would have been able to track down former employers and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, the former secretary of labor and social affairs, admitted that the law “had loopholes.”
But Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, swift action was needed.
“People are suffering too much and they need help right away,” Penning said last December during the second reading of the mesothelioma law.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasury, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment that Lang-Lazdunski boasts a five-year survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
It made Abbott stronger.
"That's not the most important thing, of course," Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Check-ups showed no signs of the disease.
I went to another inspection in March [2014].
I had a few spots [cancer] spread in my chest.
My 50th birthday was approaching.
It's not life-threatening.
It's taking him.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Currently, there is no trace of a tumor in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things -- financial security when I die, or to show a woman how an alarm clock works on a boiler.
When you hear bad news, you become negative.
You have to look ahead.
As for fathers Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant that I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very sociable and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations must face all cancer patients.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not eased by hope or just a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought with it Stephen Jay Gould) an unhappy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan said, “Mesothelioma is not life threatening.”

Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeals confirms the first successful lawsuit for damages resulting from exposure to asbestos in the UK.
World asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The importation and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
The use of all types of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The mesothelioma law comes into force in the United Kingdom.
A $350 million compensation program is underway.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos continues to be used as an inexpensive building material.
World production is held at 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose its leadership - protesters vow revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing debate on democratic reform.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district as activists began to organize and prepare just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People’s Congress essentially allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but we were furious," said Democratic Party leader Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They lied to people in Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the National People’s Congress’s Standing Committee, said allowing public nominations in Hong Kong’s leadership elections would cause “chaos.”
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that from 2017 onwards, the people will be able to vote in the executive branch.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders are firmly in the hands of the committee’s nomination process, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of the largest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Behind most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong is the Love and Peace Occupation movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district unless Beijing grants them the universal right to vote.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy in the Rain movement gathered outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and would start waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement “has considered occupying the Central only as a last step in the event that all dialogue options are exhausted and there is no other option left.
We regret to announce that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Headquarters is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, strengthening security at the government headquarters and deploying police and barricades on Sunday.
According to many Hong Kong residents, the instigation of riots is a sign that the city is slowly losing control.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of expression are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people have criticized the Occupy Headquarters movement, saying that their demonstrations threaten Hong Kong's trade -- the Hong Kong lifeboat.
“The protest they’re talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long,” says politician Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could harm the investment.
In recent days, Chinese state media have also come up with reports that portray democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists held an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
The election campaigner?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
About 1,600 amateur athletes play small football in the regional town of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina.
And their highest competition is now called Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after one of the movements that goes to the October municipal elections.
In addition, Jan Mráka, the head of a small football club in Jihlava, is the top ten on his list.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," Mráka said.
The situation around the first league of small football has already been dealt with by the lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
According to the website of the city, the small football team received about a million crowns last year.
This year, the figure is in the hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure of small football is not contrary to the law or the directives of the municipality.
However, the situation is an impetus for the Office to adjust the rules for awarding grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, a spokesperson for the municipality.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time to express as a small football support in the elections of one political party, it probably will not be possible.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to the “big” football in the Highlands.
For example, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Regional Presidency, the ODS Division or the KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL 1 would be formed.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't do that.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from companies to turn to us," said Miroslav Vrzá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, the chairman of the regional football association.
The head of the small football of the other party and the movement will not allow the name of the league
According to the players of small football, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and a bathroom.
"For example, the playground Na Stoupách is not ours, we are rented there," pointed out Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Lape<0xC5><0xA1> from Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
For example, in my opinion, a nonsensical skateboarding area will be built there, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mráka pointed out.
The mayor of Jihlava, Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS), responded that the small football team uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Ro<0xC5><0xA1>ického and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build such playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are planning to modernize or build sports facilities near schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been tremendous progress for the little football in recent years," he added.
Other political parties in the league names will not appear, according to Jan Mráka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field joins us, we do not put another one there," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the city council commission for sport.
"But let the voters evaluate whether Mr Mráka is using the association Malá kopana Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates into university life - freshmen can fly a jet plane
We are delighted to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to make the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also said that the service has its own security side.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their belongings across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that our VIF (very important fresher) variants this year ensure that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesperson said that since the services have just started, they have no reservations yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.”
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different in expectations and desires - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve this.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, commented: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students entering university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before throwing away thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting to college, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep up with the rising cost of basic necessities.
After the events in Ferguson, feminists oppose racism and police behavior
Earlier this month, a police officer killed an unarmed young man in Ferguson, Missouri.
Those present waiting for the funeral with their hands up, chanting: “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed young man Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has seen a shift in the online discussion of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender over race.
With rising tensions in the Midwest attracting the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the reaction of white women was 100% racial.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines such as “white woman thinking about Ferguson” or “Feminism is not just about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
“I don’t think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level,” she said.
People felt that they had to express themselves about what had happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially preoccupied that they had to point it out.
According to Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light the problems African-American women face every day and which are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny stories about my life with my partner on Facebook and get 150 likes from people around the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the colored being trapped in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relationships, but not about security in public spaces?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
According to her, black women could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Even though white women today share the same question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and the reason was in almost all cases of rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
You needed the cooperation of white women to justify the lynching.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when suffrage fighters like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain in the late 19th century and realized that only one group of people, women or blacks, could have the right to vote.
“They’ve decided to bet cards on the right to vote for women and the right for blacks to focus later,” Hattery said.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We've never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynching in the Southern Women's Association to Prevent Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the upheaval of white feminists’ responses to the issues that Ferguson has raised—police behavior, racial discrimination—reflects a time when white feminists had to “catch up” on issues that black women had been grappling with for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if women activists in these areas of [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they did the right to contraception?”
A second wave of feminists who have made their careers a struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now finding out what that means.
Famous feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by an attack, posting a column from the Guardian by Rebecca Carroll demanding that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
“I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society — and views on race that differ greatly in opinion polls — will seek change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the race issue in America confuse some people.
Expert at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s comments on Ferguson’s side face criticism that she has sparked before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother’s Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it sparked rage among many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only issue that has come to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country’s southwest this year, the issue of reforming immigration laws has resurfaced – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration law reform, said that in order to bring the issue up as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado says.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a resonance in women's organizations," she said.
Residential pig in Ipswich for sale
A real estate agency removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk -- a pig was resting on it in the living room when it was published.
A one-room detached house for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000 stands on a private trip in Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of the living room in which the pig rests with its head on the sofa.
Real estate agency Connells said that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owners.
"The photo got there by mistake, so it's already been removed," the office spokesperson said.
In the property information, the Connells real estate agency described the former prayer house as “a single, separate one-room house.”
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
Harvey's lottery player wins a million.
In search of a new millionaire in the southeast of Perth, one lucky man takes home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery campaign.
It was the second time in five years that Harvey's traffic had been split, the last time it was a $1 million win in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to sign up.
The owner of the store, Steve Forward, said the entire city in southwest Perth was talking about winning.
It's the main topic, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was touching.
Eight winners shared one win in Western Australia last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, the player in Canning Vale became one of the five August millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier, the couple in Belmont had won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said that winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th single lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains do not depart in the evening.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press release, the GDL called the protest a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose a time out of the rush hour.
At the time of the strike, the GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend by rail only during the first working day.
At the same time, we think of people commuting for work during the day," the union said in a statement Monday morning.
"Our first strike should primarily affect freight transport, less passengers," the GDL added.
DB has not yet issued an official response to the strike.
It is unclear how the protest will affect international rail links, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five-percent increase in driver’s wages and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average salary of drivers varies between 36,000 and 46,000 euros per year, depending on the years worked.
Engineers at the DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to allow wage increases while working hours are reduced.
They stress that the payroll of drivers must evolve in the same way as for other railway personnel, for which the DB does not count on a shortening of the working week.
There was a threat that Krest's car would start burning.
That's why the Barum Rally ended.
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I never thought it would happen.
Couldn’t the exhaust be repaired temporarily and continued at a slower pace to the workshop, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we headed straight for it, yes.
But we still had two more erezets waiting for us, and we couldn't do it.
There is a high temperature in it and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You have completed five speed tests at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
It's very good.
I felt like a young man.
We were quick, but I didn't go over the top.
Everything was due to the fact that we had been tampering with the car for more than six months to keep it at some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You set him up in such a way that you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The work was not in vain.
On the other hand, the result we could have imagined did not come.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technology said no.
You weren't the only one in the top who stepped down early from the fight for the championship.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi also dropped out.
Are you surprised that so many of your favorites have resigned?
Yes, I am.
Especially for the spectators, it was a shame, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, for whom you are planning a car, has also been at the top for a long time.
But he paid for the fact that he flew off the track and picked up almost a two-minute gap.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could have repeated the podium.
He was going through the first two times.
But Mira also confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He drove very fast.
Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum Rally.
Can a good feeling of driving make you a regular participant in rally races again?
Certainly not at this point.
Last year I said that Barumka is my last race and I still did not keep it.
I decided to go again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there’s a chance next year, I’ll probably do it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did it please you?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team goes on.
Next week we will go to Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't do too much damage here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the fabii Honza S<0xC3><0xBD>kora from us for this race.
With Mira we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you give us a hint?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsica Rally was a World Rally Championship, you reached your highest in the series in fifth place.
Would you like to try the tracks again?
It doesn't.
An Oral Agreement with an Employer May Be a Problem
Unfortunately, you did not have to issue a certificate of incapacity from work from your doctor, which serves as proof for the organization that you cannot perform work duties for medical reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
Afterwards, it was agreed that the given days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement was made only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have a written confirmation of the employer’s consent to take leave, in practice this procedure has proven to be effective.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, may be denied and the absence from work can be considered as a long-term unexcused absence, hence the reason for immediate termination of the employment relationship according to <0xC2><0xA7> 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute about an agreement with your employer, you are thus lacking evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled in accordance with <0xC2><0xA7> 53, only you have the given days listed in the credit sheet as unexcused absence.
An unexcused absence in the record sheet does not have the same consequences as <0xC2><0xA7> 53 (e.g. inability to receive material security in unemployment), yet it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have him/her confirm in writing that an accident has actually occurred, as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called "incapacity", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, as well as early notification to the employer or requesting written consent to take leave.
This will avoid any possible complications.
Tony Stewart on his way back to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just halfway through the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the bar a second time after his right front tyre burst in the 172nd round and the race ended for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car into the garage, made no comment to reporters, and left.
Chad Johnston, the team’s boss, said Car 14 was disappointed but would now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, next weekend.
"I wish we had a better performance and a better conclusion," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart collided with the barrier for the first time in a Sunday night race after colliding with Kyle Busch, which required repairing the right side of his car.
"We were hoping for a good finish for today's race," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up.
He returned to racing during an investigation into the tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who put Stewart on the road during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion was warmly encouraged before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the beginning of the race he worked out to 10th and then even to 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, went out of turn and hit Stewart, sending both cars into the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague elects new taxi station managers, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for new taxi station managers.
For 103 parking spaces, it receives approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until recently, the taxi collects CZK 150,000 a year for the same seats for taxi drivers.
This was reported by the councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used draws to select administrators.
The winner then received the lease for a lump sum of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
Currently, the amount of the offer is decided.
"A year after the original lease contracts were terminated and tender procedures were opened, it has been proven that the new lease system is far more advantageous and more fair for Prague," the councillor said.
The most expensive spot is Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n<0xC4><0x9B>
The highest price was offered by those interested in the station in Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n<0xC4><0x9B> street.
He will pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately CZK 1.5 million were paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for the rental of taxi stations were adopted by the councillors in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year they terminated the original lease agreements.
The tenders took place in four waves and a new manager was found at 29 sites.
This is the second time we have had to clean the well this year.
We drained it all the time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Savo in there.
Unbelievable smell!
Our well in the basement always provided enough wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't that professionally done, Grandpa dug it out with his own help.
A long time ago.
It was just for three rounds and overall peculiar, like everything else in the hut, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
Even then, the water didn’t seem to smell.
We wondered if something had fallen.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a little bit of bad luck, the plate did not quite lie there, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we shone through it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we have improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
On the ground lay a glued packet with some cubes.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where there are vents, my grandfather's invention, there were fish leftovers!
And heavy jets!
Our cellar is also peculiar.
Some would say that Grandpa just buried the cottage.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and floor are just suffocated sand, only the ceiling is paved.
There are mainly boats.
And a car.
And sun loungers on the beach.
The door with the wide gaps was mostly open, as if someone had been walking there all the time.
At the ceiling several of the aforementioned vents.
Without a net, birds usually fly there and build their nests on the beams.
There is no point in talking about mice.
Grandpa wanted it to blow, and it did.
But now the air didn’t help either.
The whole cellar stinked.
We cleaned the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: boards, a heraclitus plate, and so on.
Our remote cottage welcomed passers-by with a disinfectant odor.
We were wondering, who could have brought us those disgusting leftovers?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It's hard for her to come to our house for a snack.
Grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who was not quite well.
Isn't that Franta the one who put those disgusting things in there?
He's here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to guard the cellar and the well and inspect it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests were finished, but it was already good.
Pulling water from a forest well is nothing I would like to do for a long time.
Once we heard a terrible anxious barking of our bitch.
Mom looked down from the balcony and saw a long thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Reza leapt over her, hissing like a madman.
Mom scolded her because she thought Reza had dug the waste hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose was partially rolled into a ball and partially straightened.
There was a hiss on the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical seizure.
We ran downstairs.
Uzovka, long over a meter and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Reza prevented her from doing so.
It was unclear whether she wanted to save the toad or whether she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the surplus in the form of our whole family, she probably thought we should eat it, since we are so hungry, and elegantly stretched through the vent into the cellar.
We flew to see her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind a well.
Just by the way, we recorded another stinking package on her plate.
Smells like fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit tricky.
We locked the cellar during the day.
Is that...
We went out, and there we all lay down to one vent.
We didn't wait long.
There was a mess behind the well.
First there was a flat head with yellow calendula on its neck.
Then the whole stump fell onto the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to conquer the inside.
Fired employee takes revenge, buys laptops and sells them
After his dismissal, the disgruntled employee bought computers for the company and then sold them.
The money was spent before the police were arrested.
In a short time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers in twelve cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After taking over, he took the laptops to Olomouc, where he sold them at bazaars," said Rostislav Brückner, chief commissioner of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk police.
The reason for the fraud was the revenge of the employer for the dismissal and also the profit of money.
"When questioned, he claimed to have used the money to repay loans," Brückner said.
Police also found out that the fraudster is a pathological player who has been repeatedly treated in psychiatry.
The money could also end up in winning machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is that we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who was previously convicted of theft, now faces a prison term of one to five years.
Police have not yet said whether the bazaars, which bought the laptops below the price and continued to sell them, face punishment.
"It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
None of the bazaar owners have yet been charged.
Come on, a little more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made some changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route, which brought the target to the watershed instead of leading back to the Yellow Bath.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the booth, where we took photos and made videos together.
To bring my view from the other side to perfection, I accepted the role of a personal conductor.
Together with my friend Katya, just before the start, we obediently lined up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes.
We greeted our friends who were walking past us in the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A couple of bums to warm up, turn on the sport testers, countdown and start!
There were shouts of cheer, but instead of a quick start, there was a cupping to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the measurements and start at a pace of ten hours.
We intertwine with the yellow snake runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, they all look fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad an almost kitschy touch.
The throbbing mass stretching along the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
On the waterfront between Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally starting to show who has how many forces.
The light hill on Palack<0xC3><0xBD> Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before the transfer to the Theatre I see a police escort and just after him, Vítek Pavli<0xC5><0xA1>ta flies to his destination at an incredible pace.
I hear the admirable sighing of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's about to slap me, but just before that, my leg swells and our hands just pass.
Taking the Theatre Street gives a chance for a short rest and breathing.
It is necessary, there are places in front of us where the views take my breath away.
The turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I can't breathe and my legs are almost alone.
Behind the first refreshment comes the moment of truth.
While crossing the road, Ká<0xC5><0xA5>a squeaks on the curb and shows a jump by swimming.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm triggering a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and we continue along the Kozí lane, it is one of the narrowest places of the track, at this stage of the race there is no such rush, but you still need to closely monitor the surroundings.
I still have no idea that the concept of the narrowest place will get its true meaning later.
Behind the Dust Gate, we are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to clap anyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kata to do so, because ten clappings with fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are accelerating again and although we have fallen quite significantly, now the hunting ride has begun.
We overtake dozens of runners, when I pass someone especially tired, I try to encourage them with a few words: "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
At the last refreshment no one is ahead of us, we are accelerating.
So far we have run for an hour and a quarter, we add, there is nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish line will hurt, but you really need to get wet.
The sun is slowly setting, and the end of the day symbolically ends the race slowly.
Last run to the bridge, turn and just a straight line to the finish line.
The pace we're running at amazes me, where does that girl come from?
"Come on, we're going under thirteen, we're working!" I called.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and here's the target.
Hour thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set an hour limit of 20.
So seven minutes behind schedule.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Katya's legs break, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-performed performance.
After a while, I slowly lead her out of the target area.
Euphoria does not allow us to think about the crowding in the passages to the dressing rooms.
You can see here that Goat's Lane wasn't the narrowest place.
This is where the floodplain, which under the pressure of almost ten thousand runners is crammed to burst, is located.
If someone doesn’t like crowds, this isn’t the place for them.
After a while I also lose my mind and wonder if the beautiful views and the more interesting route compared to previous years were worth what is happening at the finish line.
I know from my own experience that running a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people are added to it, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all traffic, it is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere inflated in <0xC5><0xBD>lut<0xC3><0xBD> Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> was transferred among the runners even in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators scaled it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, when running through the historic centre of the city, one has to reckon with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of a mass race in a place that is bordered on one side by a wall and on the other by a river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I consider it very good.
I was a little concerned about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route and what you say about the situation in the destination.
Prison guards organize protests in Bulgaria
Hundreds of prison officials across Bulgaria took part in a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which had recently changed.
In the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of justice Hristo Ivanov, there are also higher salaries.
For a month, the guards symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the unions of prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"The negotiations are still ongoing," Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Workers' Trade Unions at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests.
Why the Universe May Have More Dimensions and We Can't See Them
Physicists don’t usually write bestsellers, but Columbia University’s Brian Greene scored in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for the layman to penetrate the thicket of problems that many theoretical physicists deal with today - an attempt to unite two wonderfully working but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the fundamental problem between the two key theories (after all, at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and solve it so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to the layman.
Moreover, Greene dealt with the complex material so freshly and engagingly that he could not be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he corrected his "mistake" for the most part in the next two books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object if his book became obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a bit more lively in this area (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go on "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter the Greenem nonviolent open doors of the world of modern physics.
How big can our universe be?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound silly, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Nevertheless, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more mundane, namely a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine pulling a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scene from a half-kilometre away (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily see a long hose stretched horizontally, but if you do not suffer from acuity, the thickness of the hose is difficult to recognize.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at that moment, you only answer with one data: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from a half-kilometre away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping the hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is obvious that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the movement of the clockwise direction", i.e. around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where there is a wrapping hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note Experts note that this chapter focuses purely on fault string theory.
Chapters 12 and 13 discuss non-disruptive aspects.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the perimeter, indicated by a circular arrow, is short and bent.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the wrapping circuit of the hose is short, "coiled" and less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of the circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, curled and much harder to observe.
Of course, in the above case, we did not exactly go through to reveal the "coiled" dimension enveloping the thickness of the hose.
You just had to bring a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - the bent dimension would only be revealed with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein an article in which he suggested that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to us all.
Kaluza argued that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be weaved into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately the question arises as to how this observation of Kaluza goes along with the obvious fact that we see three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly expressed and refined by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that just like the dimensions in the hose-length direction, our universe has three dimensions that are large, vast and easily visible, and we are aware of their existence at every moment.
But by analogy with the circular circumference of a garden hose, the universe may have additional dimensions, tightly folded into space so tiny that they have remained hidden from our most advanced experimental apparatus.
In order to get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stay a little longer with the hose.
Imagine that we draw a fairly dense series of circles on the perimeter of the hose in black.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, the drawing will now reveal the curved dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, that is, four spatial dimensions together.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, note the illustration in Fig. 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space similarly to how we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth magnification level) if they are folded into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid represents the commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circles represent a new, tiny and twisted dimension.
Just like the loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of usual dimensions - only for the sake of clarity we have drawn them only at the intersections in the square mesh.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales as meters, depicted by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each following image, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see in the first few levels of magnification.
However, as we go further on our journey to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space - to the fourth magnification level in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, curved dimension in the shape of a circle, similar to the loops of a thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, just as a hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn a circular dimension only in some, regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-spreading spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
More importantly, we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly curved dimension is extremely miniature, it is much harder to recognize it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - than to observe the obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our most modern magnifying tools.
Most importantly, however, the additional dimension is not just a round bump inside normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
A circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of three ordinary large dimensions.
It is a dimension independent of the remaining three dimensions, just as the dimensions from top to bottom, from left to right and from front to back are independent (and perpendicular) of each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the three usual still position in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data is five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

To our surprise, therefore, we find that even though we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein’s reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe may have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The state-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a meter.
We can barely see the smaller curved dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could be about the same size as Planck's length, a size far beyond the resolution of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluza-Klein theory.
Honza Homola advises how to practice on electric guitar: part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in the twelve-tact harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Anyone who is into music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
The puppeteer and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be followed here, has been living as a graphic artist since graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohlan, from which, unfortunately, it is impossible to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as well as his brother Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j, the leader of the Wohni family.
Start training on a single string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can come up with anything, you just have to apply it to the harmonic model of the twelfth," advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what can be invented with twelve-fold harmony on two strings and how nice it is already beginning to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add a fourth, beware of changing the tuning, points out Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonic and you will try to put it together with the twelve.
So practice it honestly.
You can read this in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school of playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not a big celebration, admits Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák from Hradec Králové
We take the point and we like it for it.
The first half we had more chances, the second home," said the striker, who this time scored from the penalty kick.
Were you not nervous when he played, after all, he was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn’t notice it in particular, although for the second goal, where there are domestic fans, it would probably be worse.
You evened out a penalty after half an hour, but you also got a goal from a penalty after less than four minutes.
What's the matter with you?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, there was a horn and then a penalty.
After that, you got up and in the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that after the collected goal we played well until the break.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn’t.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the homeowners said something about their game about the break, they were probably not very happy with it.
You scored your opponents on the pitch for the first time, while you may not have scored a goal at home yet.
Why does it make such a difference?
I don't think it's that much of a difference. It's up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plze<0xC5><0x88>, that’s a different category.
You were waiting for a goal for four matches, were you not afraid that it could be similar after the last match?
Maybe not, but of course we are glad that since last match we do not have to listen to talk about waiting for the goal.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet for a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a crater miles away.
Lava flowing to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from a crater miles away.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the aforementioned underground lava tunnel.
This is what scientists are most concerned about...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
From yesterday morning (31.8.)
2014) still flies out of the crack approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is 50 times bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open even in places where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, and with similar intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökulsá a Fjöllum River and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulfur around the eruption, and clouds of steam and gases rise from the fissure.
This is certainly not a tourist-friendly eruption, as was the case with the Fimmvör<0xC3><0xB0>uhals eruption in 2010.
This is much larger and there are also many more gases,” says volcanologist <0xC3><0x81>rmann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
Traces of the sandstorm were washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, orange (second highest) for Bár<0xC3><0xB0>arbunga and yellow (third) for Askja apply.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings
Flight day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 featured acrobat Peggy Valentino, who climbed from the cockpit to the bar on the upper wing of the biplane, as well as between the wings.
There it relies only on the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers again managed to prepare several interesting aerial pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only a "walk on the wings" performed by German acrobat Peggy Valentinová, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his shiny coating.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After the First World War, many former war pilots tried to enforce it.
Due to the high number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the program of air days.
Peggy climbs from the cockpit to the upper wing after takeoff.
There he performs various exercises.
At the end of the performance, she will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day said.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the highlight of the show, then the Mustang's next performance was the famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter jet was brought to the surface with the Grippen of the Czech Army in a hinge (the so-called numbers).
Such a line-up could be seen by air fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavsk<0xC3><0xBD> then showed everyone a breathtaking acrobatics with an airplane from 1945.
It was made during the war, but probably never participated in it.
He was enlisted in the Army Reserves.
Since 1963 he has worked in the civil sphere.
Even as a racing plane.
Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
In the same place is also another pearl of the Cheb air day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, the massive machine could not be overlooked.
His polished aluminum cover shone in the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force was also admired.
A small airliner jumped behind a discarded Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from Hof on a flight day.
German neighbors demonstrated in Cheb with the reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft or the three-man Bücker Jungmann biplane formation.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic comeback in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhy exchanged her parental worries for the work ones at least for tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde moderator obviously doesn't know any of this.
The TV news moderator was doing just fine, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months!
It's only two weeks since the blonde ended her sixth birthday, during which women experience the greatest stress after childbirth.
Lucie, however, will not appear regularly on TV Nova’s main news broadcast.
Regular return awaits her according to Blesk.cz information only in a month.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs her more than television viewers do.
Lucie Borhyová returned to the TV screen and it was a hit.
Exhibits for a year in Prague?
Hall would sell out, planning a bachelor party Jagr
It would be honorable if something like this happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called Golden Match, in which the stunning Nagano team met again.
Even the players who participated in the golden hattrick.
Players want to play, don’t they?
I'm sure.
It would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, it is possible to find one or two days during the tournament when there is a full day off and where such a match could be mixed.
We will tell Gum (Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC5><0xA0>légrov) or Bé<0xC4><0x8F> <0xC5><0xA0><0xC4><0x8D>erban (the organizer of the Jihlava match), who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey playoffs?
So if I'm flying in...
You don’t want to play in representation.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow change your decision?
Representation and exhibition match are two different things and in representation are decisive performances.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but the performance is crucial, especially for the World Cup.
Players who can do it should go there, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you enjoy that Nagano reunion?
The meeting with the players was great.
He revived the stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
The most important thing, however, was the tribute to Ivan Hlink.
And it’s good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that a generation that was really worth it is leaving.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka and Petr <0xC4><0x8C>echmánek at the inverter.
Can you still remember your first match?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames, and the three youngsters, me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, were in the same trio.
It was the first start for everyone.
But that we would dominate in some way, that cannot be said.
In Jihlava after a long time caught Dominik Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashana on ice never surprises me.
I wanted to pay him back with the criticism, but I can't (Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek criticized Jagro for the reasons why he decided to leave the national team).
Even Hnili<0xC4><0x8D>ka did a great job.
He was training with me one night and there was a hole.
And now he's catching fabulous.
First the U.S. and then the Netherlands, football players begin qualifying
Prominent guests came to the Smíchov NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech from Chelsea, national coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, the character in the black hat, it's Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>!
Arsenal midfielder and captain of the national team arrived at the meeting at about half past twelve between the last.
We have a great match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said as he appeared before the journalists in a show set.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday 1 September: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open to fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of the meeting
Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> et al. can support fans before Wednesday's game against the USA (20:15).
The national team opened for them Tuesday training, which starts at 6:30 p.m.
And it will be followed by an autograph show, which neither Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> nor the Czech will miss.
Otherwise, the national team will be more relaxed.
This is praised by coach Vrba, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
We will now focus on the Netherlands.
There is an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not had so much time before," Vrba praised himself, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The national team has three matches under Vrba in a row, all preparatory.
With Norway and Finland, she drew 2:2 and lost 1:2 to Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
Not until now.
The match with the Netherlands will start the qualification for the European Championship 2016.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if they could manage the general against the US.
The first half of the year was to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player in the 23-member nomination who has health problems is striker David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he didn’t make it to Wednesday’s game against the United States, coach Vrba would have called in another striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A British woman describes how she thought she would die after being misdiagnosed for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT), a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is estimated that approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can manifest symptoms in the area of motor skills such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
Patients may also experience numbness or pain, the condition is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA), a disease with a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before her eighteenth birthday she would be confined to a wheelchair and dead before she was thirty.
A mother of two, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as the others.
I fell down every day and it took me longer.
I could never ride skates or skateboards with other kids, and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran.”
When Rodgers was thirteen and had several surgeries to loosen her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor had left the room and looked into her file, where she learned that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When they responded, I was in shock, completely panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the time I was eighteen, and I'd be dead by the time I was twenty-five, and in the meantime I'd gradually lose all my powers.
I was on my own, planning my own funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had anticipated, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening.”
After several genetic tests, he was found to have CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of fortune," she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched the CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: with the turn of the economy, taxes are rising
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country rose slightly last year as the economy recovered faster, and Washington-based firms were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia combined spent $27.6 billion in fiscal 2013 on state and local treasuries, an increase of 3.8% over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden -- both state and local -- rose 4.3% last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9% last year, and was the third year in a row after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were reduced.
According to a study by Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased by 4.3% faster than local levies by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56 percent, is from business tax, and 36 percent of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, has proportionally the smallest business tax revenue.
The researchers say the majority of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate owned by companies, which has increased real estate taxes by 3.7% this year for three consecutive years, with growth of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York and Texas, it seems the same situation is in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, an annual increase of 4.2% compared to $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not so much drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., property taxes account for nearly half of state and local taxes.
“In Maryland, they own a lot of real estate companies, most notably the D.C. tax base, the government, or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenue cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business revenues also appear to be increasing.
Companies in the region have published a corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland levied $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing equally fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average level, at 4.3%, while Maryland’s growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below average, to 4.1%.
Of the three counties (all of which have the same taxation), Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate, at 6%.
The Maryland corporate tax rate is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study was not evaluated.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law lowering the corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, just like Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to up to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
The business tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax – a structure to offset rising costs by raising prices under which most companies are organized – in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say the trend and nationwide trade tax increases are likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for state and local governments rising to 6.2% compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may be lagging behind, as cutting government spending takes its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin’s Novorossiya and Lafat’s scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin Calls for Negotiations on Novorossiya
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government forces have clashed with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the Ukrainian military in the east of Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
According to him, the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions on Russia?
The Czech Republic enforced the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is due to propose a further strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided on Thursday.
This was stated by the Permanent Chairman of the meetings of the member states Herman Van Rompuy.
Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said concrete proposals to move the form of sanctions would be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new "president" of the EU.
Van Rompuy to be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at a summit of the European Union to head the European Council, the so-called EU president, who chairs the summits of the member states.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two-and-a-half years.
Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini will replace Catherine Ashton at the head of European diplomacy.
The Italian woman, who will thus become vice-president of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed in office by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, only it is not talked about
To help an incurable and long-suffering patient leave life?
In the Czech Republic, where the law does not allow euthanasia, this is not legal.
However, from the statements of the doctors who approached LN, it follows that they hear about such requests.

Joan Rivers' family: "We're keeping our fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a New York City hospital, but her daughter has said she is not losing hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover.
“Thank you for your support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're keeping our fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call said she had suffered a cardiac arrest at a Yorkville endoscopy in the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her sedated and under close supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious.”
Reactions did not wait long, including the incredible support on the Internet from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is distorted by headlines
That the media distorts reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And this is a fact that has been bothering me very much lately, the more appropriate the word annoys.
This concerns in particular the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel Attacked Gaza" are quite common.
Only in the text you will read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
The headline reads, “Both sides violated the ceasefire.”
Is the journalistic community aware that, by doing so, they are directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been 60 years since the end of World War II.
There are still survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany where the crowd shouted slogans like "Jewish swine" and similar superstitions, I fainted.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that after the Jews they were destined to liquidate the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care in your work.
You are often referred to as “the watchdogs of democracy.”
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided to liquidate the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live on the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don’t go among “their own”, for example, to Gaza, they will answer you, why would they do that?
They have jobs, social security, and top-notch healthcare in Israel (I’ve seen with my own eyes how the top private Hadassah hospital, which is funded by sponsorship donations from Jews from all over the world, is also commonly visited by Arabs and treated there, of course).
Hamas is also targeting its Arab brothers with missiles.
The only real help for Gaza, and thus for this troubled region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even indirectly in the headlines.
Report on Hamas practices, its abuse of people as human shields.
“Hamas aims to eliminate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the deaths of innocent Arab children.
Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Report that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been thriving thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which the Gaza administrators do not pay, and they are even upset that power supplies are sometimes cut off at this time.
If Hamas hadn’t invested money in building underground tunnels to allow suicide bombers to infiltrate Israel, but perhaps in building apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would have been much better off.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed a claim by Information Monday morning: an online retailer — a video producer and hundreds of other things — is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million) in video streaming service.
The announcement sparked surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought by anyone, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, Twitch’s $1 billion sale to Google looked certain, and the connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago by Justin.tv, was set to become a widely used video streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to stream games online – in Business Insider’s words “YouTube for Live Gaming.”
Twitch's interface.
There are already popular YouTube videos of "Let's play", a kind where the wise men (mostly older ones) give the games a Mystery Science Theater treatment.
The fact is that YouTube comes up with a lot in the description of Twitch, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch did not excite anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube failed, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Emmett Shear, CEO of Twitch, said: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision, and wants to help us achieve it faster.”
Another mystery is - frankly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they prefer to do sports than watch, it’s hard to see what’s so amazing about just watching games instead of actually playing.
It’s one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder playing Resident Evil at three in the morning, and it’s a whole other thing to watch a stranger get twenty headshots in Call of Duty.
All the games you can watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are from a player’s perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that speed run games in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age finish the game in record time are fun.
But if someone isn’t a master of play or humor, their Twitch channel probably won’t be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is the fourth-highest internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon use this?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch interfering with Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube might have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As the CEO of Twitch Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of games" and the media don't seem to be reluctant to even - swallow - viewers.
The Second Lie of Creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
The original video is attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of many things that conflict with their religion, they often ask: Who will you believe?
The Word of God or the Word of Man?
It is as if human inquiry is utterly futile compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to “the Word of God,” they refer to myths about God written by men.
If there really is an intelligent with a creator for some purpose, then it is he who has created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who has invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who has added other series of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
Humans couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, they can plot.
And it was the people who wrote all those lyrics that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but these texts were not written by anyone but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, one holy scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because human authors would not be able to measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have to believe it blindly, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and reveal a deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God had written it, we would have expected nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, all of which are continually falling apart into increasingly separate denominations, searching for questionable truths, and each in some way claiming divine guidance, regardless of the continuing dispersion and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Akdás, Zarathustra's Avesta, the Sikh Adi-Grant, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, and the Book of Urantia are all considered to be "the absolute truth" and "the true ones of the Bos".
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is, to some extent, misguided.
None of the aforementioned books has any advantage over the others.
None of them have any evidence and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies (defenses), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
Therefore, it cannot be claimed that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are said to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies – with each one also likely to contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
The leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions, and views by their primitive and often politically-motivated authors, thereby explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I would not call it a contradiction, but rather a reciprocal comment.
We have to point out again that we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author, and it is certainly not an eyewitness account!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, i.e. the five Books of Moses, and do not attribute any of them to Moses, because he almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docites and the Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these administrations refers to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a grave threat to the young religion of Moses, the authors of the New Testament decided to mock and Ba'al Zebul, the "Lord of the mountain" was changed to Beelzebub the "Lord of the flies".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions at the Nicaea Council.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen more were rejected by a simple raising of the hand, as if the fact of a thing could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they found that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the narrow confines of the original church.
So the council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they just as consciously removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should the word of God refer to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the real author of this random mix of legends, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by humans, and certainly not very enlightened, but quite the contrary!
That is why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is from beginning to end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in incantations, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought using a magic rod to sprinkle blood on someone would cure them of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and pi was a whole number.
These people believed that when they showed pregnant cows striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How can someone who knows something about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know this.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain nothing at all of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it fails completely because, most of the original Hebrew scriptures were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who ignored or promoted cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slavery, abuse of family members, child abuse, sexual abuse, abuse of children, abuse of children, sexual abuse, abortion.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But the creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why is that?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, they are one and the same.
Ironically, they reject God’s “work” as “worshipping creation instead of the Creator.”
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and of God himself, and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So this is a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God himself because they think they are His word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that humans have approved or rejected into their supposedly “immutable word” of any god has been concocted, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, and often intentionally altered and distorted by mere misguided humans.

Chinese school shooter stabs nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China news agency, forcibly broke into the elementary school building this morning and attacked at around 11:30 a.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
Therefore, the public is calling for greater security measures and better child protection in a country where many married couples have only one offspring in accordance with government policy.

Minister of Education Marcel Chládek has started the new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect Czech education more with Czech sport," one of the reasons why the first day of school went to the north of the Czech Republic.
The school management approached him a while ago at a hockey match in Litvínov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate in the opening of the school year," the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) has started the school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
This year, 115,000 first graders entered the classroom.
In total, over 850,000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
David Fiala is the new art director of Nova News
David Fiala became the new art director of Nova TV news and publications on September 1st.
He will be replaced by Alan Záruba, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphics department of Z1 news television.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has been involved in the implementation of a complete visual transformation of the news sessions of TV Newspaper, St<0xC5><0x99>epiny, Prásk! and other publicist programs of Nova TV.
David Fiala masters the synergy of communication between the editorial office, studio management and graphics department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
He has a sense for typography and clean, elegant design, which is the path we want to follow in Nova’s visual news,” says Nova Creative Director Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, the public got naked pictures of celebrities
Screenshot with a list of leaked files
An anonymous user posted nude and pornographic images of American celebrities on 4chan, according to Mashable.com.
They were allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple’s servers, where the affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities have rejected the images as forged, but several have already acknowledged the authenticity of the images.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known from the title role of Katniss in the film series Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in Deadly Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich them.
American magazines reportedly expressed interest in the footage, but according to reports on the server 4chan, the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, this is very likely a security vulnerability in iCloud.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on the GitHub server that allowed you to obtain passwords to user accounts through brute force, that is, by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool has proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before publishing this tool.
As a precautionary measure, iCloud users should change the password associated with their Apple ID.
What matters is the length of the password, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The leak of nude images of celebrities is seen as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in homes or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt your files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it takes place only on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will be able to timely move sensitive images "to safety", and most importantly you will have space to delete failed images, so they will not unnecessarily occupy space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet are offered to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valá<0xC5><0xA1>ek in PDF format.
A smart way to save for a college script
Since the cost of a college script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, a prospective second-year student came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He devised a system of borrowing books from high school classmates, offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“I got a computational book, which normally costs $180, for a semester for ten and chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his final semester would cost $430, he says.
Spend 120.
According to the University Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and utensils, but students have different options to manage these expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions like Schroeder’s become the preferred choice for students.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, which runs more than 250 bookshops on campus, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
A sector-by-sector survey shows that about a quarter of the books in the university’s bookshops were borrowed last spring, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of University Stores, less than half of teaching texts are purchased in university bookstores.
Here are the 101 Best Ways to Succeed.
Buying online
The prices of some new books may be up to a third lower online than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler’s “Calculus” book is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new one at Chegg.com, a bookstore specializing in textbooks, for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind other people’s notes or wear and tear, the teaching texts used are a good option.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The new one sold for $48.
University tutor Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their tutors whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes in the seminars are not significant.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc’s Half.com is also a popular alternative for buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering renting textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow a “Calculus” for about $20 for the entire semester.
Get acquainted with the terms and conditions of the store where you are borrowing the book, including penalties for notes, highlighting, or wear and tear.
If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-books
Another option is to buy an e-book instead of a regular book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends “Calculus” for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, students of literature courses can find the best deals, because many classics are now available for free download, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who is soon to enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order a book online, make sure it’s really in stock, Gault advises.
He saw it in his own skin.
The book he had bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found the torso of a rifle from the end of the war in the well
The well is located near the church of St. George.
We discovered the vegetation around and began to pull out the old deposit - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay bottom, we ran into a barrel,” said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found it was the torso of an attack German rifle used by the SS.
The finding is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," added Novák.
All wooden construction things have decomposed over time, therefore it is unusable.
Her body, however, is preserved - it keeps its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS, probably out of fear of being pushed back.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were dropping guns in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing the Jeseníky Rainbow Movement enthusiasts found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them around here, so we slowed down the excavation work, carefully digging through the mud to avoid any misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The find will end up in the depository of the museum at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
Exclusive interview with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who is freeing Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Sorry, I have to take this... I'm being called from Donetsk," he apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, Ukrainian Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the POW Liberation Center there.
Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban in a TV debate.
At each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers, or the places where they were — or should be — that Ruban specified with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there," he concluded one of the flash discussions with Donetsk, and again focused on ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests on the Maidan.
Yesterday - when we were arranging an interview - he was in Donetsk.
Ukrainian soldiers are freed from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists 24 hours a day.
You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number at 30.
Of course, there may be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated already captured Serbs, Dagestanis, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not the Czechs yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captive compatriot and can free him.
Ukrainian Soldier Captured by Separatists
A.C.: What advice do you give to Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will shoot them mercilessly after interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists regard these men as mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists, including a Czech, they put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy's just gonna make it.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in the war.
Q: How many prisoners of war have you rescued?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it has long since exceeded a hundred men.
We've long since stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we've only freed them... not saved them from war if they choose to continue fighting.
The rescuers are doctors, surgeons in the war, but we certainly are not.
That's the way it is.
And every day there are more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes a simple human plea is enough to free the prisoners.
A.C.: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust with the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both warring parties?
That's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev nicknamed me "crazy general with steel balls".
It doesn't offend me.
And maybe that describes the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officers’ Corps, I had already gained some authority.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
No matter what happens, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
If they torture and kill people?
So I just tell them they're being tortured and killed.
And that these are crimes.
I often risk my life, even being taken prisoner in a prisoner swap... this job could mean the end for me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.C.: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know about?
... (long silence)... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture during interrogations.
I'm sorry.
And the executions?
This only happens on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
There are no indications that the Ukrainian military is doing something similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give figures.
A.C.: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying for independence and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk – that’s what they say.
They don’t want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents – life or death.
As we say, they were eaten to the throat.
The same dreams and desires were also expressed on the Maidan, by the way.
And now I will speculate a little: Russia supports the separatists, and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other, on the contrary, to be small.
But this sentence of mine already hides an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.C.: For example, what does one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler, look like to you?
Whenever I cross the front line, I am unarmed and show soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters in a shotgun or in an optical sight.
I can see the faces of the people who are pointing their guns at me every time... and they can pull the trigger of their guns at any time.
Paratrooper, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small governorate in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and considers Ukraine to be a kind of misunderstanding.
According to him, such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.C.: Speaking of characters, in a talk show on Ukrainian television, you described your prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, as a weak, helpless and tired “leader” who would do best if he left quickly.
I always get scared at least five times in those 300 meters of walking.
Why should I hide the opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.C.: Do you think he is involved in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk "the rabbit".
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of Ukrainians an animal that would be feared or have respect and authority in others.
His behavior directly mimics the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister in war he has no right to cry in parliament, to beg him, to play with him his intrigues, to threaten to lay down his office... he must govern the country, administer it and protect it in time of war.
When the country is threatened, the prime minister has no right to family, friends, rest and weeping emotions.
He is the first minister of Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he has never been strong... he does not fight for Ukraine, he just constantly complains about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save revenue
Sylvester Stallone’s expendable three returned less than $30 million from the $90 million budget in the U.S., and Sin City: A Woman for Whom I Would Kill from the $70 million budget returned only $12 million.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz only grossed $14.6 million during the first weekend, and also children's films like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were a disappointment to the cinema.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in The Telegraph, the quality of children’s films is to blame.
Collin described 2014 as the "worst" year for children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films deployed to a slightly older target audience, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average ratings of summer film premieres aired in at least 2,000 theaters between War Victims Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is of similar quality to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, it may be due to a change in the approach of viewers and the higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what has already happened.
Unlike the current Hollywood blockbuster crisis, Netflix’s net profit was $1.2 billion, nearly twice as much as last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book rights and predicted Hollywood’s “collapse.”
In light of the current decline, some commentators claim that there may be something about his catastrophic oracle.
With the release of possible major box-office blockbusters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other figures are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the decline in sales simply "cyclical." He told the Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest box office blockbusters in history, and no one will worry about sales."
North Korea threatens Seoul with another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of joint US-South Korean military maneuvers, which Pyongyang sees as preparations for an invasion.
The province of Chagang is located in the northwest of the DPRK on the border with China.
A South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman said the missiles were fired from a location in northwestern North Korea and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea has apparently launched a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
There is an underground launching ramp for Scud missiles in the province.
This is another in a series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests were held by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough monitored the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO young tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, the concerned relatives called the police around eight o’clock in the evening.
A search and rescue team was dispatched, including local police, and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls at about 11:00 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell while hitting his head.
The officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
They were transported to Blue Mountains Hospital by ambulance.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the winner was Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek
It was the 23-year-old forward who could make the decision, but failed in the two biggest chances.
After the goal, the shot called mainly close three minutes before the end, but the place in the network ended on the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
I had it on my feet, I have to give those chances.
"I'm angry with myself," he said, pouring his ashes on his head.
"I guess I should have put it under the lid, it's a little off," he thought.
The defense of Sigma did not allow Opava much, with the exception of Mikul's attack from the 11th minute, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanács started pushing, but in the block defending homes did not let them in, and the missiles from a distance caught Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
We compared for 15 minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more from the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But Vasí<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not change the chance, so it ended 0-0," resented Hanák coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda.
Opava took the point also due to absences in the line-up, where, in addition to the two injured, Petr Vav<0xC5><0x99>ík and three-goal shooter Petr <0xC5><0xA0>ev<0xC4><0x8D>ík, who are visiting Sigma in Silesia, were also missing.
Unlike its previous policies, it did not allow them to enter.
Substitutes are deserving of discharge.
Sigma was more footbally, but apart from one standard, we didn't let it go," Slezanów coach Petr Baránek said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and combativeness.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent win for us,” he added.
Sigma was tied for four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lébra, who after defeating Znojmo conditioned his million-dollar deposit in the treasury with diametrically different performances in the next matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébro's warning, so there's no question that the boys wouldn't want to fight," Kalvoda said, adding to the sleeping shooter's address: "I believe it will come, and when he scores a goal, it will start falling down there.
But after the first goal, I will replace him immediately, so that he saves goals for the next matches," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has been impressed by Venice twice.
The film festival is in crisis.
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iñárritu suddenly ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the following days suggested that interest in the 71st Venice Festival had somewhat declined.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed, but less appealing, images as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s.
Heroes of Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been besieged by such crowds as in the past, and it has reportedly ceased to be a problem to get a last-minute place in the hotel.
The crisis is talked about in Italy more than anywhere else, and it is no wonder that it has affected so respected institutions as well as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but by those present exclusively in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for autographs from comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully taken on dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations, the main event was the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino.
He also starred in two films.
In the off-competition narrative of Enlightenment, directed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison based on Philip Roth’s novel, Pacino, 74, has a role that is close to him: an actor at the height of his fame, suffering from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as the strange owner of a hardware store from a country town in the film Manglehorn, made by David Gordon Green, was truly an unforgettable experience.
Volpi's Cup for Best Actor shouldn't miss him - but does a Pacino-style artist still need prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and of the Italian one especially, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly declares himself to the country from which his grandparents came.
Points for Italy
The Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, was the first film since Birdman to receive a long standing applause.
In it, the Calabrian branch of the mafia is viewed as a view of family relations between clans fighting for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, a camera, music and actors.
Hungry Hearts, the chamber psychothriller, starred Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost kills her own child with her devious anxiety.
On the contrary, neither the Ransom for Glory nor the Three Hearts received a warm reception from the French competition films, both of which adhere to the traditional model of consumer films based on the popularity of the actors.
But after all, two really great movies, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so few for the first half of the festival.
And while the festival’s filmmaking has depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich’s new film She’s Funny That Way, a humorous comedy set in Venice out of competition and shot in the style of American cheerleaders of the 1940s, has been able to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police caught four manufacturers of meth in Prague, drugs were transported from Poland
"Detectives have detained three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman, who produced and sold the drug meth in Prague 9 from November to August this year," police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said in a statement.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, an intervention unit in Cihlá<0xC5><0x99>ská Street caught a forty-two-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who appeared in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a dose dealer.
The next day, the detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, with the prior consent of the public prosecutor.
The last of the four officers was captured on Wednesday morning, August 20, at the premises of the Mala<0xC5><0xA1>ice incinerator," the spokeswoman said.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of activity.
In the workshop of the summer complex, in the garden house in Horom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice, in the apartment in Kon<0xC4><0x9B>vova street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced methadone, procured various aids and chemicals necessary for its production and ensured the transportation of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He then weighed the drug, distributed it into plastic bags and then sold the meth.
He was helped by a 25-year-old woman, who had not yet been convicted, to transport drugs from Poland or sell them to drug addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced,” Rössler added.
On the basis of the judge’s order, the criminals also carried out several home searches, where they secured drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salary bags, syringes, hoses and other aids and items that can be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The drug dealer has been convicted seven times since 1995.
"From the available evidence, the police found that the main organizer has been convicted of property crimes seven times since 1995, and the woman has not been convicted," the police spokeswoman added.
The last person arrested was a conditional conviction in 2006 for a sexual abuse offence, and the 37-year-old car mechanic, who is being prosecuted on the loose, has been convicted nine times since 2009.
This was mostly due to property crime as well.
The investigator charged three men and a woman with committing the crime of illicit manufacturing and other handling of narcotics and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator also filed an application for detention with the prosecutor, where they were eventually placed by the judge," the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old repeat offender, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as crucial as that of the other defendants.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things in its other products for a lot of "interesting" prices.
A good example in Italy is handmade chess with a playing board of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, prepare more than $40,000.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer receives a set of wooden black and red painted figurines stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibers.
It is probably not surprising that instead of a classic rider, players have at their disposal a figure of a rising horseman.
If chess doesn’t seem like a valuable gift to you, there’s also a Ferrari 500 F2 made (of course by hand) at a scale of 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Dissolving high school and high school doesn’t make sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics show that gymnasts have a good application.
The start of the school year is here.
There has been a lot of preparation in schools over the past fourteen days.
Most of the time, it’s routine, like moving the pots from the summer store back to the classroom and pumping up the chalk.
They're going to have a little bit more frmol at the high school in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year high school in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice after three years opens and resumes its activities.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering it in the register of schools administered by the Ministry of Education and Science.
“French socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says François Hollande’s key ally.
Valls is calling on the heavily fragmented Left to “show its support” for a militant socialist president whose new division of office has not met with the approval of the majority of French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stand by his side," he said, applauding.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question France’s controversial 35-hour work week, despite passionate conjecture from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who suggested earlier this week that the rules should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain "cohesive" with the government.
But Justice Minister Christiane Taubira drew a line on his budget when she appeared at a meeting of insurgent Socialist MPs where she criticized the Socialist Party for making “the French lose faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pen, a leader of the extreme conservative right, laughed at the constant internal strife among the Socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is naked, and they were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and stated that she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was ready to govern the country.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections and in May the extreme conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll conducted by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French will soon run out of patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It’s a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there is a change in the situation,” he said.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new leadership of the capital.
There will be no more games on the streets of Prague before the municipal elections, and the city will not restrict street art.
Dog walking will not be restricted.
Prague will not have time to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees before the October elections.
"Moreover, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, whose mandate ends in a few weeks," said Councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling in their territory.
But the casinos won't disappear, the gambling decree won't change yet.
This is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
We would not be able to do that technically now, for example, due to deadlines for submission of comments and the like,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current parliament, which must approve the amendment of the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on the general prohibition of gambling is planned on the day of the municipal elections in the city districts of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, gambling is banned in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change even in the case of street art, the so-called busking.
Prague 1 in particular complains about this, which has already sent the municipality a proposal of places, which would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of And<0xC4><0x9B>l.
A decree regulating dog walking is being prepared by the city for several months, but has not yet been finalized.
The location of the games and busking issues are solved by city decrees.
They may be issued or amended only by the City Council.
Town halls have only an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed the victory of Scottish independence proponents at his fingertips.
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake a third time, when it almost placed on billboards all over Scotland the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you won’t get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet or gaining their respect by threatening them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots are much more inclined to drive the exchangers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond knows this well, so he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, in a televised debate whether he was willing to respect the “sovereign will of the Scottish people” if Scottish voters voted for independence and began to support a single currency for both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate.
However, the debate about what kind of currency Scotland will have has already been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities, and the defense of public health, which citizens have for free.
Darling supported the London bankers on the issue of currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of the healthcare sector.
As Salmond put it, “he got into bed with the Conservatives.”
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to voters, but to an association of "bosses", to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to discuss independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
So Cameron looks like a cowardly absent housewife.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish prime minister.
At least Cameron was able to say that Scotland can be a “successful independent country.”
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's causing him almost physical pain.
What it says is clear: Scots should not jump out and must accept what is.

Illustration of the Longest Year
Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Urban Longest year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week, which was no longer going anywhere and we just lay and swam with my grandmother summer, silence before the storm, calm before stress.
New clothes, when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the fiftyth time, the squeaking of the bike up the mountain around the Imperial to the back of the Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun stroked his back and shoulders, the farewell rays were tapped.
In the evening a slight nervousness, still a holiday regime, to sleep until half eleven, in a week it will be worse, the moments before going to sleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then in the morning to get up at half seven.
Monday's coming.
It usually doesn’t rain, on the contrary, the summer is maliciously sneering in front of school.
To arrive in a ghostly light on the sidewalk and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paper, there is that school, ZD<0xC5><0xA0> A.
Zápotock<0xC3><0xBD> with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more elongated, girls more busty.
There's scoundrels out there, avoiding them, just as interesting as how infallibly they stick together and how early they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls, who came screaming, are now laughing hysterically at something, I guess something has changed in their life during the holidays, while for me everything is the same.
And the new freshmen, some nervous and others delighted, why do they even come here?
Because they have to, educationally obligatory.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the poisoned janitor with the mop, unfortunately, is still the same as the one who, it is said, lends the pupil the key to the tin box where textbooks can be left and which is still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing room remains in memory, it is not happening now, it is pretty airy, but it will get worse in a week.
It's just the idea that makes your stomach squeeze and your head hurt.
A head that's even harder to grasp in maths, that devilish game for the elect, which I don't belong to and will never be.
Again the threes and fours, God forbid the fives, hide from rehearsals, fit into the bench and best sublimate, be there and not be there, exist only as a name in the classroom and dream about stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas in the universe, where no one carries anyone, no one carries anyone.
The longest year is 10 months.
And it's just the first day, like it was years ago.
She left her daughters to die.
She faces an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without help, a little girl was born to her, whom she wrapped in a ready-made blanket after she had cut her umbilical cord, hid under her jacket, and carried to a road attendant, where she put her in bushes located a few dozen meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
I guess it came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I needed to go to the bathroom, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut my umbilical cord with the scissors I wore to school," the defendant said, saying she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the place, put the child's body in a backpack and took it away, took the body out of the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother's house in Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Brod," the lawsuit says.
It could be tens of minutes, but also several hours after childbirth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or when inserted under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman, at an undisclosed time from February to April 12, when the corpse of the child was found by random witnesses under a bush near the pond in Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>kobrodská, again gave birth secretly.
This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house.
Without verifying whether she was born alive, without cutting and ligating the umbilical cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic containers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Later in the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Eventually she was betrayed by a friend.
The father of the two children was a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about the partner’s pregnancies.
And for this reason, he is not now in court, he was only punished for misconduct against the Funeral Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like him not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the baby against my wishes.
I know my decision wasn’t right, but it felt like human at the time,” said the defendant, who allegedly succumbed to the man in the relationship and was afraid of him.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly evenly.
Tears came to her eyes only when she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching adulthood.
She didn't want to kill
"They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't buy a kit because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I still wanted to put it in the baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can’t explain it to you,” she told the judge.
She refused, however, to act with deliberateness and intent to kill the newborn.
The second child, she said, was stillborn.
Even during pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
However, I have limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
“I also quit smoking,” she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible on her in both cases, everyone, even after repeated questions, claimed that she had health problems, that she was watered.
Even my friend.
The trial will continue in the Hradec Králové court on Tuesday with the testimony of the court experts.
A verdict could be issued on Wednesday.
The woman is threatened with a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching the $3 billion acquisition of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the world’s third-largest cruise operator, has advanced in negotiations to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal would allow Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company that competes with the larger rivals Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp. (CCL.N), access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and a wealthy clientele.
The deal could be made public this week, the source said on Sunday, but said negotiations may still not end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be named because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment on the situation.
Headquartered in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6% from the previous year.
The 29 billion cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies are competing to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offer with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since 2007, when it closed a $850 million deal.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with cruise operator Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure businesses and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed its shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
As of the end of June, Genting owned 28 percent of the capital, Apollo 20 percent and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 8 percent.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities a day after the vote
There was a group of people loyal to Beijing waving the Chinese flag.
A standing committee of the National People’s Congress approved on Sunday that only two out of three candidates should take part in Hong Kong’s 2017 elections.
All candidates must first receive the support of a nomination committee, which is likely to consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get onto the ballots and get pro-democracy activists to renew their promise and cripple the Hong Kong financial center with the “Occupy Central” protests.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, with Chinese leaders fearing that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report outlining China’s official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city’s business district and occupied it.
The press conference, at which Prime Minister Li will speak, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Zhang Ronghsun, Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Office of Affairs, were also expected to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain had never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin urges Kiev to open talks on ‘state sovereignty’ with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “state sovereignty” of the detached areas.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin’s remark was not intended to imply that areas of eastern Ukraine controlled by the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian-speaking region would be given authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call on the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals is in line with the apparent strategy it has followed since the riots erupted five months ago: Help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorossiya de facto independence so that it can join the West instead.
In an interview on state television, Putin denounced Ukraine's military actions to recapture the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have referred to the recently occupied territory as “New Russia” or “New Russia”, a term referring to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russia’s Itar-Tass news agency published Putin’s words that “a prisoner is an illusion” to anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon, as Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns ahead of parliamentary elections on October 26, while government forces attack civilians in areas controlled by separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under negotiation with the leadership of Kiev for several months, to alleviate concerns of Russian-speaking regions about threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter to discuss between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman’s intervention to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks highlighted Russia’s leadership’s approach to addressing the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two-million-strong population is ethnically Russian.
Moscow should have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians, and opinion polls conducted before the conflict have shown widespread support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia’s main navy, maritime trade facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russian Rostov and Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
In his June 7 inaugural speech, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers, after the new elections, consider changes to the constitution that would give different regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs considerably from that of the Kremlin and the separatists: Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as its equals follows the rebels’ further advance last week after Russian troops and tanks penetrated eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear it is a campaign to occupy strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This hastened a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a 500,000-populated metallurgical port between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any definitive steps - the leaders called for the adoption of further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units infiltrated the Donetsk region last week to support the siege.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion were traded on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the scandal.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers, who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence's nude came online in the biggest hacking scandal ever.
The hacker claims to have sixty photos of naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The iCloud leak reportedly leaked personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based actresses Greece.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greece last month, told Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, said the hacking was "shameless" and those targeted "feel humiliated".
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 photos of Palmer with her former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of her smashing upstairs by the pool.
Palmer starred in the film Love and Honour, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, TV series star Chuck Strahovski and thriller actress Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
Lawrence’s TMZ deputy said: “This is a clear violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on Twitter: “Publishing photos of hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma players reconciled with Lébra, even without a win
Olomouc - The thunder and lightning that the co-owner of Olomouc Sigma, Josef Lébr, sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be a thing of the past.
If from Opava they brought only a point for a goalless draw.
By deploying and combativeness, the club boss has reconciled himself a little.
The money for the paychecks could come to the club soon.
"I'm going to keep one more game, as I said last week, but I'm a lot more optimistic," Lébr said, adding that despite the fact that Sigma didn't win, he was convinced by the players' improved performance.
The combativeness and dedication we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive that he won't win.
If we had played like that since the start of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet,” Lebr thinks.
Sigma in Opava withstood the initial pressure of the home team, then leveled the game and in the second half was already better.
The confidants reached for the victory of Calvod, but they did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not as we imagined.
To our complete satisfaction, however, we lacked only one transformed chance," said Lébr, who does not think that only his threat caused the change in the attitude of football players.
There were certainly several aspects.
Whether it’s from me, the coach, or the fans,” Lebr said.
With pressure, Sigma must reckon
The players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to put these things away completely.
I tried not to admit it," shook his head young goalkeeper Michal Reichl.
Completely without comment, then left the question to Lébro's statement from last week striker Václav Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not turn the biggest opportunity of Sigma in Saturday's match.
But then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We will always be under pressure.
They're all trying to pull on us.
“Today we showed that if we fight and we all ride on the ass, it’s going to be possible,” he said.
They took the warning to heart.
Even coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda did not hide that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It's been hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was obvious that they took to heart Mr. Lebro's warning.
Even before that, it wasn’t that they didn’t want to fight and they smashed it,” the Olomouc coach said.
It was like the first 15 minutes.
It took us a while to come to terms with the hardness and realize what the second league was all about.
It’s not just about football, it’s about fighting,” Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next games, this Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
