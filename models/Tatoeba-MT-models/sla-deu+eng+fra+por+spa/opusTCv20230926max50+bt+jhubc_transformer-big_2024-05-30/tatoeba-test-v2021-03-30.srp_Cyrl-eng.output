Why would I want to kill you all?
The bathroom is upstairs.
She took care of her son.
Somehow we survived.
It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
He abruptly stopped smoking.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
Don't thank me.
What's the difference?
She looks like a Greek goddess.

Choose one.
He got what he wanted.
She drinks like a scumbag.
They need each other.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
I want you to introduce me to Tom.
After a long discussion, I ended up doing things at random.
You're absolutely right.
Tom is ruthless.
Termites eat trees.
You've let me down.
- What's this?
So do I.
That was very good.
She takes care of her old mother.
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Go straight.
Just like a bean.
It's empty.
Where did you get that idea?
Mary snorted.

I can't sit still.
Happy Easter!
I owe you an apology.
Which way are you going?
Please read between the lines.
I had lunch in a hurry.

It's good to see you again.
Why are you acting like this?
He's not missing anything.
We live in the atomic age.
Mary earns her living by sewing.
Where will Tom sleep?

Tom's getting on my nerves.
I'm studying now.
When did you get home?
He asked me to help him.
This isn't true.
I took the first step.
Can you keep a secret?
I nodded once.
Do not waste words in vain.
Did you do it on purpose?
Don't get caught.
Tom is a living proof that you don’t have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good tutorial.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think we should write to Tom?
We ran out of town.

This tea is good.
Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
It all happened at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I pissed him off.
I pretended not to see.
I was trying to be polite.
I'm naked.
Success was only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse's burnt out.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
Mary was as angry as a lynx.
Turn left.
Don't say a word!
I know as much as you do.
I can resist anything but temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a hairdryer?
You are under oath.
I wish I'd known.
I don't think so.
Are you looking for something specific?
Don't worry!
Caroline is sad because she can't get pregnant.
I took off my wig.
That's my cat.
He's standing there.
He is known as a great painter.
Why are you mad at me?
What's your name in Bosnian?
