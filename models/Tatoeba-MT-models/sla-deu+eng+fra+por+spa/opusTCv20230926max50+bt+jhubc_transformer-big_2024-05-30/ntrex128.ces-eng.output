Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried that they will “look like Muppets”
Some members of the Welsh Parliament are perplexed by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could provoke ridicule.
One Labour member said his group feared that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means shit.
A member for Plaid said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh conservative said his group was approaching the name change "with an open mind", but noted that the MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision on how members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh government law gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, where broad support was received by the option to call the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of members of the assembly, the commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant gained the most support in public debate.
Members of the assembly are obviously proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a concern for President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for disqualification of members and a draft system of committees.
The members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians to vote on name change
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
A popular vote is expected to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly protested against the country’s requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would not follow the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's quiet as Harlem churches fight for survival
"The old people I talked to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"There's none today."
The disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are talking differently nowadays,” he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
As he adds, the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of this type of people, which will not help much to the remaining tabernacles in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and therefore the day will soon come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into apartments will become members of churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose devotions were held nearby.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert, who played the bell-player in July, called it a “cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell-playing game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell-playing game at a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin has had a complicated history of architects and builders, some of whom were called by lay representatives of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The Council of Elders – the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay representatives – sent a letter to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to pass the costs” to the council of elders, even though it did not participate in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Who Dived for Lobster in California
According to an official report, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for lobsters in California on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then rowed to him with the whole group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially considered the call to be a joy from catching a lobster, but then "he realized he was screaming 'He bit me!
He bit me!”
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that "he had the entire area of his collarbone torn."
“I shouted, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” adds Hammel.
The boy was transported in critical condition by helicopter to San Diego's Children's Hospital.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles, a lifeguard, told a news conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury’s wants to build on the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains through beauty lanes in the style of a department store, where dedicated shopkeepers will be available.
As part of the strong <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn market in the UK, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods sales are declining, aisles with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country. If successful, then next year it will expand to other stores.
The investment in cosmetics is associated with the efforts of supermarkets to find use for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves and household utensils.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products and introduce brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing assortment from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space thanks to branded locations similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also reintroducing its Boutique makeup range, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will test the concessions of Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer. The first such store opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and another will be opened this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift to daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe says stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and has also established a number of Habitat departments, which are the chains it bought two years ago. Thanks to this, food sales have increased and acquisitions have become even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to remodel the department with a cosmetic and pharmacy assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of drug sales revenues in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125m to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds pharmacy chain.
Lloyds plans to add an expanded range of luxury skincare brands to four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director, Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and style of the beauty lanes to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should cater to all needs and the enticing environment and convenient location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that are changing old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones Is "Angry" After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is "raging" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby quit her $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly brand of home clothes and accessories.
The couple's business has been compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old announces her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones’s Dragons Day star by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones “was furious” when the TV star admitted during a tense Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that because of the new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – she would no longer be able to devote enough time to their Truly homewear and accessories brand.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the fortune of moderator Willoughby at an estimated value of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his summer residences.
An unnamed source said: “The Truly brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would secure her for several decades ahead.
Her decision to leave was shocking to everyone involved.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods at Marlow Headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the show This Morning, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to the fat investment in products from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes and the possible further delay of the launch of the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
The couple go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Ante McPartlin on I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters.”
Difficult Negotiations "And Then We Fell in Love"
He joked about the criticism he gets from journalists for a remark that some consider “unworthy of the president” and for how positively he talks about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “voter” voice.
"I've given up nothing."
He noted that after Trump praised their June first meeting in Singapore as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in further meetings.
But negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after a summit in Singapore in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “appropriate response” from the United States to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, he said, have yielded positive results — ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages and returning the remains of U.S. troops to their homeland.
And defended his unusual approach to informing about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people from the outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been expelled from their homes, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging,” Ms Sumbung said.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palo, but it is unclear if foreign staff can work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Paula to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country is still pitifully unprepared for the wrath of Mother Nature.
Tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, but this is not common in other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of sirens warning Paula of a tsunami may have contributed to the loss of human lives, even though the warning was issued.
Even in the best of times, traveling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in the case of natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which anchored in Lombok and helped earthquake victims, is now moving to Paula, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was at the heart of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He will seek re-election next year, but his government is plagued by funding shortages.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, with Muslim-majority members adopting a more conservative form of faith.
Street battles between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people and driven tens of thousands from their homes.
Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool scored a balancing goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards in front of Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
He threw the ball on his left hand and fired at a remote pole.
The bullet flew high and pointed at the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually skipped jumping Kep Arrizabalag and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get in the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching me, so I didn't think about it much and fired at one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward sent his passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the pitch and sprinted to half Liverpool.
Kovacic passed the ball quickly.
Then he sent the ball down a beautiful alley to Hazard in lime.
He fled the defense and left to a distant pole next to Alison Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will face the local team in the Champions League group at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The Indonesian disaster agency said on Sunday the death toll from the quake and tsunami had risen to 832.
The 7.5-magnitude quake struck Friday, sparking waves as high as 6 meters and imprisoning many people in the debris of collapsed buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an office spokesman, told a news conference.
The city of Paula, which has a population of more than 380,000, was dotted with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Stabbing Woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and the police immediately launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something to sign up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to appeal to anyone who has moved near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
“I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers whose onboard cameras may have detected something, to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
Friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene this afternoon to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said an investigation is underway and are now informing relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back into his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
Residents have now learned that it will take several hours for them to be able to return home.
A police officer told one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He keeps saying, “That’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were behind the tape and another one was waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the area who are monitoring the house.
Anyone with any information can send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and enter the code 247 from September 30th.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has recently become a hit because of an argument about "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical, Taliban-style Puritan followers destroying many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “foolishness” and “an effort to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Palace of Westminster would become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not order or implement iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The splendid portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century thinking and part of the historiography of a character that many think still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today a little less than at the end of the 19th century, a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of endless historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure who represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Slaughter pig kills Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig farmer was attacked and killed in a market in southeast China.
As the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, a man with only the surname "Yuan" was found dead with a cut artery in a pool of blood near a pig market in Liu Phan Shui, Kuizhou province.
The pig farmer is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in a pigshed on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, he and his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan arrived to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next pigsty open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the pigsty with a mouth full of blood.
According to the information, the forensic examination confirmed that a 250-pound pig tore the farmer to pieces.
"The cousin's legs were all bloody and torn," Guiyang Evening News quoted him as saying.
Security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market at 4.40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was locked up so that no one else would think of it when police were gathering evidence at the crime scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Pig attacks on humans are rare, but they have occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and injured a man critically.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and was driven away by the farmer’s wife.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
In the coming days, however, flooding will bring floods to northern Mexico and southwestern the United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa reached wind speeds of 137 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure furrow is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical moisture north into the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity, with the approaching furrow of low pressure, will cause heavy rains in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Precipitations of 25 to 100 mm locally cause dangerous flooding, debris streams and possible landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour in places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, flooding can occur.
Given the danger of tropical rainfall, it would be very unreasonable to go on foot into the desert.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to become raging rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local gusts of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure furrow will bring heavy local rainfall on some parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller debris streams and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning, rare tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evening and Tuesday the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic begins to cool, but the tropical zone will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of the significant temperature differences is the center of the USA on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there is a difference of almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will again try to spread the resurgent summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and east of the United States, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures around 27 °C from the southern plains to parts of the northeast of the United States.
In New York City, it could be 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the US in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interrogation.
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday's eye-catching testimony from Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting him allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with reporters interrupting routine programs with reports of Friday’s sudden turnaround: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was touching her drunk at a high school party and trying to undress her.
Kavanaugh, in his excited testimony, said he was 100% sure it hadn't happened.
It is likely that the event was watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company calculated average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers for other stations broadcasting the statements, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching in offices.
For comparison, it is similar to the number of viewers who watch football matches in the play-offs or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest rating of any station, with an average of 5.69 million viewers following him during the day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest continued even after the negotiations were concluded.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him screaming at protesters on Friday morning as he was about to take the elevator to a court hearing.
CNN broadcast live how he stood for a few minutes with his eyes down and was cursed.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard, "You have power, while many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement, and even before the elevator door was closed, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks were later broadcast live when the Judicial Commission was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to be put to the vote by the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After interviewing Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘politicians’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of being “politicians” about Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close to being on the front page with the prime minister, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal to have Britain and the EU levy their tariffs on each other was “completely nonsensical.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dyteon Simson, 20, had been arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and Sims lost his glasses during the match, according to police.
According to CBS' WABF channel, police seized the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to police, Simpson confessed to shooting Wayde after being interrogated.
According to the lawyer, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana Refugee Police Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked local police officers for their "driving and pursuing justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death "shook" and "shocked" the team.
"This is what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spilling ash on Mexico City
Ashes rolling from the volcano Popacatépetl hit the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after the volcano's activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center watched a series of rattles and shocks.
Images of the windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, have appeared on social media.
Geophysicists noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017 and had a magnitude of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
On the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
Police have blocked a group of masked separatists throwing eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, fighting broke out, which the police had to use batons to calm down.
Over the course of several hours, independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of protesting supporters of the union who shouted "Long live Spain".
According to the local press, fourteen people were slightly injured during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is being celebrated by separatist Catalans, tensions in the region's independence-seeking region remain high.
Voters voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence, but voter turnout was low because opponents of secession boycotted them.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in violent clashes across the region.
Independence groups remained outside overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who took part with his wife in a separatist protest, said he no longer hoped for the prospect of gaining independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had some of the best moments.
My parents were crying with joy to be able to vote, but now we are in a dead end,” he said.
Despite the important, albeit close victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence supporters had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went into exile themselves or are waiting in custody for their part in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old installer, Joan Puig, recorded a police support protest on his phone, saying the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting tense,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail for trial since late last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men imprisoned after car hits house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly hitting a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the house had been damaged.
At one point, someone may have fired a crossbow at the car.
Meng's goal secured Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Livingston, who was promoted from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and awarded Steven Gerrard only the second defeat in 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not yet won the Premiership this season on the guest pitch and will face the first Hearts to lose eight points next Sunday.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has expanded the division's unbeaten lineup to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, hasn't experienced a defeat yet.
Livingston didn't take a chance against the faint guests
Holt's team should have led long before the goal, because his directness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow slipped just past Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
It was enough for the locals to watch the Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that they could bother guests with standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
A free kick was ordered against the Rangers, and Livingston created a gap, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sent Menga to scoring and scoring the ball in the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated possession, but home defense was impenetrable for them, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was usually not too busy.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed from another standard situation at Livingston.
The penalty area of Livingston was constantly being cleared by the players, and two penalty kicks came to naught - after Halkett's attack on deputy Glenn Middleton and another by the hand.
“The Phenomenon” of Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were outstanding without exception and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team has hardly changed since their return to the top, but Holt deserves great praise for the way the team has stirred up since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was tremendous, leading a well-ordered defense, while Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert all the time.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't meet those standards anymore.
Their finish was poor – they only made it home once – and it should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, as they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne.
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to improve ties between NATO allies.
They disagreed over a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting outside the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people, many of them Kurds, were also heard protesting against Erdogan, condemning both his policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the controversy of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks and cursed as an autocrat by others.
Deptford accident: Cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died after a collision with a car.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and the busy Evelyn Street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance soon arrived, but the man was dead on the spot.
The death occurred just months after another cyclist died about a mile from the scene of Saturday's tragedy in a crash on Childers Street when the driver fled the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said police were now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternate routes, and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in the riots at the men's high-security prison.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
In order to cope with the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, specialized guards from the Tornado team were called in.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
There are more than 500 inmates at Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had ended up in the hospital after the prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, law enforcement units were called to the prison because of serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (a drought-prone area can benefit)
It’s not common for Arizona to be hit by a low-pressure tropical furrow, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa surpasses the desert southwest and risks flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained their tropical storm or pressure status below the distance of 320 km from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local totals of up to 100 mm.
For those not at risk of flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing because the area has been hit by drought.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these precipitations may help somewhere, because the southwestern United States has just been hit by a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least “extreme drought,” the second-highest category.
Hurricane Rosa's journey will first take you to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the strength of the hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning it will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h to the north.
Then the storm meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall will be severe, posing a high risk of flooding.
"In the area from Baja California to northwest Sonora, total precipitation is expected to be between 75 and 150 mm, with up to 250 mm of rainfall likely to occur," according to weather.com.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north and arrives at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, then crosses Arizona and enters southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
"The main risk to Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very strong collisions in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause deadly flooding and debris streams in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was taken to hospital and his condition is now “stable.”
Police in Avon and Somerset said young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who may have a recording of what happened on their mobile phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh “experienced the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the reckless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “experienced the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress Thursday, where he vehemently and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers several decades ago.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her charges.
The president said on Saturday that on that day, "Americans were witnesses of Kavanaugh's splendor and quality and courage."
He told a crowd of his West Virginia supporters that "the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is the confirmation of one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has an outstanding record of service to the public."
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans taking part in midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
"I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
A Republican adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people and the death toll continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday at least 384 people were killed after Indonesia’s Sulawesi island was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, many of them swept away by huge waves that flooded beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on Friday at the beach in Palu, but six-meter waves hit the coast at dusk, killing many and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people still continued their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they fell victim to the waves,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, a spokesman for the Indonesian BNPB disaster mitigation agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave did not go by itself, it took cars, logs, houses with it, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave on the open sea was spreading at a speed of 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster mitigation agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal city even on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPTT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s powerful quakes was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city lay at the end of a long, narrow bay, which might have made the tsunami wave even bigger.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found enclosed under the debris of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said there could be more casualties and damage on the coast 300km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala that is close to the earthquake's epicenter.
According to him, the communication was "completely crippled without any information" from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday for not reporting that Palu had been hit by a tsunami wave, although authorities said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building is heard screaming desperately warning people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the coast will be hit by a water wall that takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the record.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was reopened only for aid transportation and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit evacuation centers in Palo on Saturday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paula, where they were hiding in cellar shelters built in the courtyard of an office building, they saw images of destruction on the way, Mr. Doseba says.
"They said they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he added.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began sad disaster relief work, some complained that foreign workers with extensive experience were not allowed to come to Paula.
Under Indonesian law, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to flow to the place of calamity when a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but that’s not the case yet.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami occurred in Paula, friends and relatives of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be those miracles that alleviate the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Another of the people imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been practicing paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” she says.
Mr. Gendon described how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to contestants from Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, instead of a pair of blue ticks, ended with a gray mark.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while replenishing an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport Police Department press release, thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee while refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to put more money into it.
As he did so, another man “runs out from behind a Brink employee” and steals a bag of money to be put into an ATM.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
For any information on the identity of the suspects, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, tweeting, “A creature formally known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is due to release his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the creator of the show.
West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him, in addition to shortening the existing professional name.
"In my opinion, 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, where 'you' is the word," West said earlier this year as he spoke about his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the one, to mere Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Many other famous rappers have also changed their names.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
JAY-Z, West's former associate, also wrote his name alternately with and without hyphens and capitals and lowercase letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
As left-wing student movements spread across Latin America, soldiers began shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who study and opening up other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are dragging young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. to double artificial intelligence funding
According to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government published announcements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, introduced a plan last year to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are much further away than the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the chance that the next major breakthrough in AI will be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that surpassed the best American player in Othello, and later served as Microsoft’s chief research officer and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“Academic leaders aren’t distracted by China, they’re distracted by corporations,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve AI efforts, Lee said.
“In my opinion, AI PhD holders should be automatically offered green cards,” he says.
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Council and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence this year to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it now invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation that wanted to create the National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission hasn’t done anything for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country’s name
Macedonians on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and therefore has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised doubts about whether at least 50 percent of voters will turn up for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough members of parliament have said they will be guided by the result of the vote.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no problems had been reported by 1 p.m.
Voter turnout was only 16 percent, up from 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would open the country’s path to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small podium and pulling up chairs in front of tents erected by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the door for the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%, a much-needed investment.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
The result, he said, would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters could take part in the referendum – less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50% plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mark the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its launch in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City scored a goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton on Saturday to secure Manchester City's 2-0 win at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
Aguero’s goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with a pass that the Argentine striker received in the middle of the field.
He sprinted between the three Brighton defenders and made his way into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the outskirts of the Brighton penalty area, he bypassed one defender and overtook several others.
The next pass to the left found Sterling.
The English striker tapped the ball in the penalty area back to Aguero, who with his right overtook Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has leg problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to have scored at that point.”
However, the initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match was secured by Sterling.
The goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote pole.
Sky Blues threw the ball into the net just before it slipped out of the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the play-offs, there were few reasons to rejoin.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitcher’s place in a game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday – but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West for one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have hope for the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night by winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but still want to win their first division title.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with the greatest effort I’ll have this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to pitch Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start. He would train on Thursday and pitch on Sunday, when he usually has a day off.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has 18-7 stats this season with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump speaks at a rally in West Virginia
The president has implicitly commented on the situation around his Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republicans taking part in midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
One of the most important choices of our lives is five weeks away.
“It’s one of the big ones, the big ones – I’m not running, but we’re still on the move and everywhere I’m fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to beat to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you’ve seen it over the last four days,” he added, saying the Democrats were “angry and mean and disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud public outcry.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you bring the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait--that was really bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse stream of opinion.
He is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momenta activists in my local party voted for my warning, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs who have been told that they are not welcome – because they have honestly expressed their opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, they criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday’s Labour meeting in Nottingham East said that “we want meetings to be accessible and productive.”
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, most meetings do not take place these days, and the promise of a “kinder, kinder” policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged as acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues, who I previously thought had similar political views, were suddenly expecting me to turn 180° and hold positions that I could not otherwise agree with – whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — there’s a smear campaign on social media that calls for my appeal, condemns the center’s policy, and tells me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a surge of sexist or racist insults every day, but never give up.
One aspect of this era of politics that I am most disappointed in is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that diverse stream of opinion, and with every proposal to express distrust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
Over the past two years, I’ve been advised many times to stay back, not talk so much, and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher’s government, which let my general school class literally fall apart, I have struggled to fight for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or minister of government.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just say that when the country is pushing for a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political pragmatism will discourage me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr rises to the top
The two late fives somewhat distorted the final result, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly fun Tennant’s Premiership match.
Now they're at the top of the table as the only undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of chances, which helped the home team to win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through great trials in our games and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “All praise to Ayra, they took a better chance than we did.”
Grant Anderson's five in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Clima, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority, and Jason Baggott got an unaltered five.
Climo raised Ayra's penalty lead and then scored in the exact half and changed the solo attempt, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's five, turned by Baggott, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had left the field on a stretcher, and when the game began again, Ayr jumped again thanks to Stafford McDowall's five, which Climo had changed.
Ayra's deputy captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again used the player extra thanks to the unchanged five of Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow for attacking Clima without the ball, MacPherson of the penalty shootout put the ball behind the advancing Maule Ayra.
Climo transformed, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five home.
Star Still Game launches new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, is moving into the hospitality industry. It turned out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The sixty-six-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show he writes and plays alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the series, and Kiernan appears to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register extract, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the report, but a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested Kiernan wanted to engage in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Above public buildings flies a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described by the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
Obtaining it is our duty.”
Throughout inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource war of the 19th century – as well as the desire to re-run the Pacific Ocean.
These aspirations are perhaps the biggest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the international court, which is due to fall on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and peace and of course expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICC decision on big screens across the country in the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of intermittent talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales – who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year – is also keen on Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, much would not change.
This UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and said it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the MSD’s decision comes just six months after the latest arguments came out shows that the case was “not complicated,” according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years not only have not supported the Bolivian cause, but perhaps have slowed it down.
"The issues of access to the sea have been seized by the current Bolivian government," Zárate said.
He adds that Morales’ offensive rhetoric has weakened all of Chile’s remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will one day take action again, but after that it will be extremely difficult to have discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — would use the question of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Judgment is an opportunity to discover that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if the US can’t trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first unless it can trust Washington
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the leaders’ summit of the two rivals in Singapore.
His comments come after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears set to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has stalled for more than three months for Singapore meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "hopeful" that the U.S.'s ongoing sanctions and objections to the declaration ending the Korean War could sometimes bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows show that the latest trend of huge headgear will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy huge headgear for their spring/summer 2019 collections at a fashion show that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
Valentino's showpiece was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge reminiscent of feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories were decorated melons, a witch hat, and even a pineapple—but they weren’t designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One resembled diving equipment with a snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you continue with huge fashion – you’re in luck.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could even arrive in fashion stores.
The overgrown hats come for "La Bomba", a straw with a half-meter-wide crepe worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat that flooded social media sent another giant creation to the show pier – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that carries it.
The dark orange raffia bag lined with raffia fringes and equipped with white leather handles was a part of the La Riviera spring/summer 2019 collection by Jacquemuse at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for next summer – given the designer’s success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for overly large accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a must for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have achieved a number of academic achievements and continue to deliver outstanding exam results in 2018. Individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other community activities only underscore this.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) represents more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland and strives to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible service.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the careers they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement individually tailored school curricula, we observe that modern languages are still popular and in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes straight to their head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.”
It is an important observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year’s tests show that languages are in the first place in the tables, with independent schools having the highest success rates.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who learned a foreign language achieved the best A mark.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved the highest A mark.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects chosen by pupils are equally valued in the curricula of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 percent of employers cited as having difficulty filling vacancies accounted for insufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are a necessity in a globalised world.
Whatever career one chooses, if one has learned a second language, one will have the real advantage in the future of having such a lifelong skill.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages automatically gains an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, specifically 15 percent, being French.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially those of emerging economies, they will have a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school differs in what languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in the outlook for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, they will always have a choice of several languages in independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential in the global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's going to be fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will play for the Lakers for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James playing for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time will see it soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game of the pre-season in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
It is unclear how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the pre-season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaign appearances tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of the vote to confirm his candidate for a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in November.
What time does Trump’s speech start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very tense over allegations of sexual misconduct. The Senate confirmation vote is expected to be postponed by a week before an FBI investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans pick up the pace before the November election.
Trump’s campaign organizers say the five gatherings next week aim to “energize volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible during this busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania" could come to the rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling today, and the Pittsburgh media could watch it.
This will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the last month, where he scored more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican senator Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him with the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows It Has Stomach to Fight to Keep Hope Before Sunday’s Singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday’s pairings may be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where does the pendulum swing now?
"They led by six points and now it's four, so we take it that the pendulum is probably moving a little towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, it leads by four points and there are twelve remaining.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal in the transition from a launch pad to a green, and he sets an example.
The celebratory shouts intensified in the continuation of his lap as he mastered a key stalemate to win the entire match when he and Tomas were two holes behind each other.
His putt, who won them a 15-hole match, met with a similar roar telling you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple from Europe are four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only pair to miss the hole on Saturday afternoon, but they missed Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.'
The course and the way the energy flows both towards and from the stormy audience confirm that these are the players destined for Sunday’s victory, and that there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari before sunset over Le Golf Naitional.
Preferably both at the same time on a different hole.
However, talk of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball game, when paired with Alex Noren.
A hole and two doubles on the front nine buried the Spaniard and Swede in the abyss from which they had no longer climbed.
No one will be able to help you on Sunday.
Two-to-two-ball games are so fascinating when you watch closely the interactions of people in a pair, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give each other, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead to the last day, but this game of two pairs also showed that the US team has the stomach for a fight that some, especially from the states, doubted.
By the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads by a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of the Ryder Cup, after which it came out of Saturday's doubles games on two balls with a lead of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won almost twice over wrestler Tiger Woods, decided to make four incisions at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine, dominated the morning two-ball games with the American side failing in the 3-1 series.
The US showed more resistance in four, won two games, but could not get into the deficit.
Jim Fury's party needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points out of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating players Woods and Patrick Reed in the game on two balls and then smoothly defeated tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who lasted two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in a doubles game on two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after a two-ball game in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a 2&1 doubles defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ones and threes in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not have it on this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris won on the whole line.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and returned later to beat the pair Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a doubles game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to singles, although as Fury's defender, they only need a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, there seems to be a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says it will not "under any circumstances" disarm unilaterally and without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continuing U.N. sanctions had deepened its mistrust of the United States and under such circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told his annual general meeting that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see a response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step in the process, his statement seemed significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization just because Pyongyang had already gone through it in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and is increasing pressure on sanctions to enforce its goals, and even objecting to ‘declaring the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea and not the United States were on the side of this issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a stalemate.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting on U.S. soil was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue resolutely and without interruption until we realize complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo and Ri met side by side at the UN General Assembly, and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, only to be told by North Korea within hours that he was making “gangster demands.”
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he hoped would be the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course designed to teach them adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has forced all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho studies all night long when students are awake and encouraged with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most renowned university are often clueless when it comes to basic self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women’s Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this only now, in my senior year?’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were really seriously sleepless during the week.
The course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of student dormitories, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
However, we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of cigarette smoking,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in “studying all night” still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is also growing.
Enough good quality sleep should be the student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation switches the brain to starvation mode, so the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his classes took last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting the alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Meng's goal sunk Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy's hit confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with the 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox party sought to record its first victory at St Johnstone from 4 to 1 February, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points away from the top leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers line-up seemed devoid of inspiration and determination to make up.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and right behind Hibernian team in contrast to one goal.
And there could be more problems for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after apparently being hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which drove Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up the Hearts point last week and would have been delighted as his well-trained squad choked his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have taken possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after Meng first let Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder buried his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a quarter-hour penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson swept the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots per goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's soft shot.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for the hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' deep set.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Menga to the easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange came almost instantly when the wing sank into Morelos, but the imposing Kelly fought his way out of the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett throwing one long ball after another.
Holt's side may have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Rangers deputy Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he tangled up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old, and it is still growing... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger Counter also became a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Yeah, it's really cracking now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Dangerous Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Dangerous Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teachs Immune System to Recognize Dangerous Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can “see” the protein that is common to many cancers, and then the rivet is re-injected
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells has had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, transforming them in the laboratory, so they can “see” the protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then be re-injected into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “controls the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells were taken from patients and “teached” them to target cancer cells, has already been promoted in the treatment of the type of leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon, wearing his mage hat, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was whistled at Saturday Night Live after a confused performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing a third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again hat, he spit on the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“I talk to white people a lot and they say, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
“If I were racist, I wouldn’t be in America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL opened a parody show starring Matte Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the rape allegations of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that his head ornament had been eaten up behind the scenes.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place," he told the Washington Examiner newspaper.
West continued, “Do you want to see the wrong place?” and added that he would “put on his Superman suit because it means you can’t tell me what to do.”
Try love."
His comments earned only the buzz of the audience at least twice, and the SNL members looked outraged, embarrassed, says Variety, and one person even said, "The whole studio was completely silent."
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many by singing the song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the most daring characters: THANK YOU FOR PUTTING A DAVID."
But guest talk show Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was just who he is, and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I DON’T WANT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes or by promoting their ‘art’) who I believe represents and sends out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to the symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Attorney General's Office.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington has embarked on a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
However, the actor, 31, stepped out of the stereotype of a macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believed “something was wrong” and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of the Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to expressing himself “quite strongly” on the issue.
"At this point, I personally feel quite strongly - what's wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What are we teaching teenage men about the problem we're seeing here?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do guys learn on TV, on the streets, they cultivate the feeling that it is necessary for every man to have such a page?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because young men have certainly changed for the worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series is over, because he has had enough of "fights and horses".
From November, Kit will play Sam Shepard in the renewed Right West, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife, Rose, was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the set of the show, so he gave me my future family and my whole afterlife,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected by the virus.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 annually.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection during these intercourses.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff would let GOP senators’ data leak, denying the terms “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff sent personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' wiki pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were backed up by “far-right” scientists and websites.
“Lies, lies and other contemptible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on charges of sexual abuse by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that the sources of the posts are associated with the Waters office and have released information about Waters staff members, Hill says.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is utterly false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly garnered online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is annoying," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests he has no temperament to be a member of Congress."
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They must not be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
You have to be calm and not get excited.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee who ran against Waters, also posted his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had alerted “competent authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English strikes review again – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is common to look for Brexit in every new British-tended film, which seems to be the case with this revival of Johnny English in a series of action parodies – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this insolent satire about how obviously bad a nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this crooked, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to mess things up again in a whole new way - that name more than anything else signaled that he was a broad comic work intended for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
He is, of course, the blunt undercover agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and a big bite of the guy who sang the single tone in Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and international mystery man who Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard, and who left behind a mess.
In this last edition there will be one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly tinkled at his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite sub-dimensional and oddly superfluous, especially when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like it’s meant for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy tramps are as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie gags in Mr. Bean.
The permanently current assumption is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the horror of an agent on duty – a role too small for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for the prime minister, who is a pompous and biased character who is already suffering under the total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this supposedly Theresa May character as best she can, but there’s nothing much in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once any of her active spies are in danger, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury establishment, but at the same time teaches record-breaking lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his former long-suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an affected character who may be wasting a bit of her talent on Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin in packing quests for Her Majesty's secret services, are back in action and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister dangerously succumbs to the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cybercrimes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farce-filled patsy: disguised as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak aboard Walt’s luxury yacht; and English triggers sheer anarchy when they try to use virtual reality to get to know the interior of Walt’s house.
All aces are definitely ready for this final sequence, but no matter how kind and stormy it is, it has something of a children's television.
Quite a moderate matter.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies developing a plan for Englishmen to work four days a week and get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is to consider a radical plan in which Britons will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company’s bosses to hand over the savings that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but they would still take the same reward.
Sources say the idea would fit into the party’s economic agenda and plan to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A long-time Labour member told the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is a wish that fits into the party’s stance on balancing the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not the policy of our party and the party does not take it into account.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return the energy from “anonymous CEOs” and “experts” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not return to their total stake, as the Labour government could make “collapses” on the basis of perceived guilt.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create proprietary funds that transfer 10% of private enterprise equity to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy said on "60 Minutes" that the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation may have changed their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings of the Office could swing any Republican senators into campaigning for their support.
In an interview on Sunday’s “60 Minutes,” Scott Pelley, a correspondent, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the accusation came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's decision, however, is unshakable.
"I have already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and that would be a truly explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York City, offering a very impressive array of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
The seventh edition of the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people who will socialize in Central Park to enjoy not only artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free event ticket (if you weren’t willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of assignments or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a way of convincing them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet will make a difference?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters since 2011, trying to achieve various goals.
He says these actions have contributed to global leaders announcing commitments and measures worth more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK partnership of investors and developers committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” promising to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a mere record,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 events calling for the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded, “It’s going to be a long and hard road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movement, we will succeed ahead of us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year’s New York City show hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy to block Russian energy exports, says interior minister
Washington could “if necessary” resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from invading markets including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern abdomen of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the help of our navy, to make sure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocked to make sure that their energy is not going to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is perceived as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach to negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
“The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is more or less to invest in or replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-off” player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia’s, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to back down from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “hostage” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is supposed to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US took a position from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industrial organization, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has urged the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren vows to “take a close look” at 2020 presidential candidacy, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would “look closely” at her candidacy for president.
During a meeting of the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top women’s position,” she said.
"After November 6th, I'll look closely at the presidential candidacy."
During the meeting, Warren also mentioned Donald Trump, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m scared to the core of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other high-ranking Democratic names discussed in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through on his return, may concern other families who are suffering the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with,” she told audiences at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest an “elephant in the room” and said of her son and other war veterans that “they’re coming back a little different, they’re coming back hardened, they’re coming back asking if there’s any respect at all for the things that their fellow soldiers and aviators, and every other member of the military, give to their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and possession of a gun in drunkenness, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla's police department.
18 States, D.C. Supports Call for New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal call for new U.S. government measures that deny asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and a district in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC said.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case filed in August by the Civil Liberties Organization of Americans against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of a violent gang" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrants Appeals Board that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new measures “ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an impediment violates this principle,” he said.
Lawyers have argued that policies that deny immigration are damaging the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems — not even all the serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palo, where the death toll has doubled, race to find survivors against time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her feverish little boy at an evacuation center in the arid city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings more bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, picking themselves up through the wet things and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were destroyed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were crippled.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors for continuing severe concussions.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the feeling that a violent earthquake had shaken the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared a room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned a paid surcharge for the China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the state of Iowa’s largest selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican side, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newspaper stand on a street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media belongs to the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Leave Their Voters Before Election Over Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans defend Chief Justice Brett Kavanaug, who faces several sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that they will see a response, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the case were extremely high, and most Republicans on record already say they want to continue voting.
These things can’t be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to reassure voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow, and they won’t forget it in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, a newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” at a demonstration in the Senate hallway, where Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Commission decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was high, it's true."
But it could be higher, especially among hesitant female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, while dislike the president, often do not go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her accusations of sexually assaulting a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, there could be resistance.
“It was a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the stool, it’s also about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a group that helps vote Democrats, said in a statement.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to trust in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with somewhat more sympathy for the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents firmly or likely believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they firmly or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet and overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s Open Source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project was “world domination.”
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the purpose of the project is to bring resources, processes and relevant skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the employees working on the project collaborated on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about introducing a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
Berners-Lee, in a media post published on Saturday, wrote that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion of net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergyman who received the Victoria Cross during World War I
A hundred years have passed since the only clergyman of the Anglican Church received the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, and he never learned that he had received the highest British military award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone to him at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of Vann’s great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “ingeniously symbolic” that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s victorious deed.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with very dense fog and heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he reached the front line and led the line forward with the "highest courage" before he individually plunged into the firefield and knocked out three separate units.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something humiliating.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "a great honor to be able to participate in the show" and added that "the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support that many people will give."
MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got a Peppa Pig
Imagine, you waited all night to watch a sloppy Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The San Jose score contained 13 points, including six on the main card, and the live broadcast was broadcast all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, viewers in the UK were stunned when the news turned into a show about Peppa the Pig.
Some remained unexcited after waking up to the early hours of the morning for the match.
A Twitter fan described the change to a children’s show as “a certain form of bad joke.”
“Under a government decree, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., and it is therefore necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator.
"Peppa Pig," yes. "
Bellator President Scott Coker said they will work on the program so that audiences in the UK are involved in the future.
"I think if I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can't do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going in and out, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We reduced it to five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried our best to keep the promises made to the fans and we didn’t succeed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Less' About Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that because of the possibility of becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has been on leave for several months due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a survivor on Laverne's first program, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and differentness were the real things that gave me the strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “Someone,” he said, not to disappoint anyone who would possibly find out what his sexuality was like.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT rights fighter and used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he called because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man -- American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "caught him unprepared."
Daley took an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died three years later of cancer – he said it wasn’t easy to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said he had "changed his whole point of view".
“If you asked me last year, it would all be ‘I want to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
A year later, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew I had dreamed of it all my life – jumping in front of our homes at the Olympics, I don’t know of a better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – Stream by Heather Small – which resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and still made him feel goosebumps.

Mickelson, who was out of shape, on Saturday in the Ryder Cup ended on the bench
U.S. Phil Mickelson would have set a record when he played the 47th game of the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he would have to fine-tune his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at an event held every two years for the 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the US, the five-time winner spent his day alternating between cheerleaders and working on a game in a row that he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old has never been the most direct of drivers, even at the height of his career, so he is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National court, where long, rugged terrain routinely punishes misguided shots.
And if the golf course itself isn’t worrying enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth match, who won all four of his matches with rookie Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If the Americans, who had four points less, launched 12 separate swords, escaped a quick ascent, Mickelson's sword could prove to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and added nothing else.
"He fully understands the role he played today, patted me on the back, put his hand around my shoulders and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He believes so much.
He is a member of the Straw Hall and has been so good for these teams in the past.
I guess I couldn't have imagined him playing two kittens.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record in most Ryder Cup events on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence with the team has brought some intangible results.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he said.
“I think the younger players also had fun going to him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a great lead towards the singles of the last days in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut at a game in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but reached the finish line with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win.
"You have to keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only close," Bjorn said in the picture, after watching them win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday for Le Golf National to lead 10-6.
So history and every member of the team has shown me that this is not behind us.
Tomorrow you will be bored.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all the points are on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try to get the trophy and that is what we are focusing on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know where to stand on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players handled the complex golf course, added: “I could never have done it alone.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
We are preparing for individual performances tomorrow and that is very difficult.
It’s great to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you’re there for yourself, your golfer’s capacity is fully tested.
That’s the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best out of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of this big turnaround when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn, then ended up as a loser when Europe achieved the “Miracle of Medina.”
"I remember every damn word," he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to head for the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to start quickly like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We set the line-up accordingly and made sure that the boys felt like you know, as if we were going to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with leading the counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the top game with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half.
“I went with that group of guys in that order because I think it covers the whole trip,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed again
Germany’s newest naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and snow-capped coastlines, local media reported.
The commissioning of the flagship "Rheinland-Pfalz", an all-new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the daily Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the demanding problems after the delivery made the fate of this ambitious project uncomfortable.
As a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates, four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will serve.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside domestic ports.
But the constant delays mean that top-of-the-line naval ships – supposedly to enable Germany to send forces overseas – will be obsolete by the time of commissioning, notes Die Zeit.
The infamous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the manufacturer after handing it over.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of major "software bugs and defects on metal elements" that would render a warship unusable in combat.
Software failures were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessel would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors – half the workforce needed on Bremen-class frigates.
The ship has also been shown to be significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfal ship will be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defects in the metal elements, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – is also a problem.
It is said that out of the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion, the price has risen to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates have become more important, especially in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, confirmed that the navy was indeed “running out of ships capable of deployment.”
The official said that the problems were constantly accumulating because the old ships were decommissioned, but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to become part of the Navy's equipment.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
At a bat settlement in the Scottish Highlands, new research is underway to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will track whistling bats and the smallest and brown long-eared and aquatic bats in the Inverewe Gardens botanical garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas of this bat settlement to monitor bat activities throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
Subsequently, a map of the habitat and a report will be issued, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and the best practice in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have been declining in the last century.
They are endangered as a result of construction and territorial development, which affect the colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatments of building materials and cat attacks can also pose a risk.
Bats are not really blind.
Because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, colony inspections, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Neighborhood manager David Thompson says it’s the ideal area for them.
"There's a great area for bats here in Threave," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's still too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive."
It emphasizes the importance of checking bats before starting maintenance work in real estate, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one breeding ground can kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put their hand to the work and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many species that we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people “wanted to make themselves visible” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which reported on the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers, calling the information “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” said the five-time winner of the Golden Ball to the camera.
"They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I’m happy and I’m fine,” the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to charge Der Spiegel with unsubstantiated charges, which they called "an inadmissible report of suspicion in a private area".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damage in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is arguably one of the most serious personal rights violations of recent times.”
The incident was slated to take place in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel suite and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the casino, where they reportedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in a courtroom in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" cool and "one percent" disappointed.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and feared “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to reopen the case because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo, who was accused of attacking Real Madrid from Manchester United, was bought by Italian club Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million this summer.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of carmakers
Britain will “forever regret” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Greg Clark, the company’s secretary.
He said it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the borders if no Brexit deal is reached could cost jobs.
Toyota’s Auris and Avensis plant in Burnaston produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My view is that if Britain were to leave the EU abruptly at the end of March, we would see production stopping at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade works.
BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford just one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers call risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” delivery basis, with parts from UK and EU suppliers delivered to custom-made cars within 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be border disruption, which the industry said could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and would thus result in a production shutdown.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plans to revive future relations with the EU are “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the grasp of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will stop, but in the long run, it warns that the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the unions at the plant, said the union members are increasingly concerned: “I have the experience that once these places are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and reliable roadmap for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with deputy attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for another week” as the fight for the post of supreme judge with Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller’s special council, which investigates interference in the Russian election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible judicial obstruction by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy general envoy and threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington’s gossip has been fed up with it for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of overthrowing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On Monday, he arrived at the White House, surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would not "prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid colliding with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, delaying the full Senate vote once again.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There has not been a date yet, it may be this week, it may be necessary to postpone it for another week, taking into account everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I will always keep up-to-date with the media.”
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said too few press conferences were not caused by an aversion to the "theatre" of television reporters, although she said: "I don't agree with the fact that he's going to perform."
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more questions-and-answers sessions than any president before him,” she added, without giving any evidence.
The conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We’ve been trying it, and you’ve seen that we’ve been doing it for the last couple of weeks, and there’s going to be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly receives inquiries when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
Health Secretary Writes to EU Workers in NHS Scotland to Not Fear Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU employees working at the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and wish that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to SMEs less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to settle the costs of requests for settlement status of EU citizens working in the transferred public services.
In her letter, Freeman said: “Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the distance continue, and they are heading towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the British government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reassure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and it is our heartfelt wish that you remain here."
Christion Abercrombie Advances Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
Tennessee defender Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injuries occurred shortly before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
The coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines, then laid him on a stretcher and prepared him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee official told Chrisz Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie underwent surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the type/size of the injury" are yet available and that the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-grader in a red T-shirt, completes his first season for the state of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five total procedures, which means a total of 18 procedures per season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying a UK property, with the extra money being used to help homeless people under Tory’s new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s move to attract young voters.
The increase in the obligation of higher real estate tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury is expected to increase by <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on buying property when they buy a property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
This action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and a focus on high-income people.
Increasing the tax on the purchase of real estate will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, while the money will also strengthen the government’s efforts to fight sleeplessness.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property purchase tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for lease purposes, can reach up to three percent.
It is expected to increase funds in the Treasury by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
Estimates say that 13% of non-UK residents buy newly built properties in London, which drives prices away and makes it difficult for those who buy for the first time to get home on the rankings.
Many of the country’s wealthy areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” precisely because of the high number of overseas buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new rules came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut on property purchases to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by occupying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to fix the “disaster of homes” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an intriguing number of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the end of “clean” evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year, I said I wanted to devote my efforts as Prime Minister to renewing the British dream – to make every new generation have a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape their lives here.
However, it may not be right to make it easy for entities that do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy homes as well as hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too distant and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland CEO Jack Ross says his "highest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of renewing the Northeast club, which currently holds the third position in the Premier League, just three degrees below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got rank B and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that draws me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I was successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety about succeeding such established names in such a large club when he previously rejected foreplay from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at that time would be measured by the question of whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
Due to the structure and equipment at this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to bring him back, but I would probably feel successful if I could bring the club back."
Ross has been a manager for only three years, having previously served as assistant manager at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from their descent into the third group and transformed St Mirren from a starting decline to a champion in the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he has ever had in his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real intersection," he recalls when Allo took over.
“I really believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, making a good living and enjoying the heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through each week.
I’m still going through them in terms of stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good in leadership.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now I’m doing it, and I feel like I’m feeling the most in my adult life right now.”

Research has found that a great time for a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the incomes of British pubs struggling, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July – but restaurant revenues declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, who produced the final reports, said: “Stable sunshine and longer-than-expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, with a 2.8 percent increase in pub attendance, but restaurants were hit even harder.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
Taverns and bars attracting drinks have done so far the most in the same way that restaurants have offended each other.
Pubs, whose main sales are from food, also suffered from the sun, albeit not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between value-added and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent per month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an analytics firm for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results are a continuation of a trend that has continued since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, although an annual drop in sales of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
A long, hot summer can’t be a worse time for food-lovers, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much-needed relief.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentations.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, an established industry benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – only 11 years old – have a secret social media account that they hide from parents and educators, according to research.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in “fake Instagram pages”
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty Percent of Students Say They Have a ‘Main Account’ Known to Parents
One in five children – aged just 11 – create social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake Instagram accounts” sharing photos.
Reports show concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of pupils said they had an embellished “main” account that their parents knew about, while also having a private account.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found that her teenage daughter was urging others to “rape her.”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) Association of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice of athletes' on Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most acclaimed athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport as those who will benefit from her far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that she will be a great asset to athletics in Scotland if she is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be the voice of the athletes and hope to be really helpful and to help run the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, won four gold medals in total and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
It’s exhausting, but I’ve been able to fully heal, I’ve learned to walk again, and I’m doing exercise today!
Thanks for all the encouraging news!”
The milk sucker that evokes comparisons of mothers to cows shares opinions online
A company involved in the production of suction pumps has divided online opinion with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
As part of the launch of “the world’s first silent wearable hoods,” consumer technology company Envi released a music video exaggerating the freedom that the new hood gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows to a song with the lyrics: “Yes, I milk, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed that I don’t have udders, here are my breasts.”
The choir continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I feed my loved ones with milk.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked online controversial reactions.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom said it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very pathetic decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after they are born.”

Another comment: “Clearly traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “This ad is completely out of place.”
There were also those who defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she considered the song "contagious".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get the pump if I was still breastfeeding.
I feel like a cow when I suck.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but it's getting to the point.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who suck out their milk (often at work or to the toilet) and feel like ‘cows.’
It is not an advertisement to praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they are all dancing with discreet pumps hidden under the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that many women who suck their milk report feeling like cows.
However, the Elvie suction pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and hides beautifully in a breastfeeding bra, so it gives women the freedom to move, the ability to hold the baby and even to walk when sucking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, commented: “Elvie’s vacuum cleaner is so revolutionary that it deserves a distinctive and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between lactating mothers and lactating cows, we wanted to highlight the suction of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable incredible sense of freedom that the new suction pump will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made it into the sun.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of the designer Marta Jakubowski, who was just using the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detainees of migrant children has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially because the harsh rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who feared the possibility of staying in the country was threatened, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people seeking escort status for single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are in our country illegally, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them," Mr Albence said.
According to asylum workers, in an effort to speed up the handling of child-related matters, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
Many appear via videoconference calls instead of personally declaring their case as a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for the aid will be expeditiously deported.
The longer a child is in custody, the more likely he or she is to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, asylum workers say, citing reports from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say these fears are heightened in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering are more likely to go unnoticed because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends could trigger a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, even as the country’s eighth year of war is already underway.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian territory are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "it will be handled accordingly."
"He must surrender immediately and unconditionally," he said.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror in Syria is almost over,” with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more lost their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this holy battle until we have ridden all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegally present foreigners.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
While extraditing refugees, Moualem said return conditions were good for them and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that caused the refugees not to want to return.
"We have reached out to international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery assistance will be available to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at Idlib’s last refuge has created an opportunity to move political discussions further.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military intervention would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee, consisting of members of the government and the opposition, will soon take place to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the panel’s work should be limited to “checking the articles of the current constitution” and issued a warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Round
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win the next election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers probably hope, the indictment and scandals did not end his presidency prematurely.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential finale in history!”
So far, there have been no signs of follower fatigue.
Since 2014, mainstream viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million in mainstream time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC increased cable TV viewership to 3.5 million following mainstream nighttime news.
“It’s a heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, the operator of Designated Survivor, told ABC’s drama about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy and show author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's funny, 'Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story unfolding in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Tuning is a luxury that only the most privileged followers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses “deep backup” resources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jackets (“clothing arrogance,” as the Washington Post put it) and the consequences of the disgusting depiction of “Stormantomy” by Daniel Trump.

Money flows from the outside into the narrowest domestic races of the medium term
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th precinct is experiencing an influx of funds through the reorganization of congressional precincts, which have generated two office holders fighting for the same seat.
This recently led to Pittsburgh’s suburban district being transformed by District Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another office holder, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, maps were redrawn.
The race in the new 17th precinct sparked a heated financial row between the main party’s financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb came to prominence in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the watched March special election for the 18th Congressional District.
This chair has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politics experts are giving Democrats a slight head start.
U.S. considers fining El Salvador for supporting China, then retreats
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was accommodated in a hotel in Panama until the partners legally evicted the Trump leadership’s organizing team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission directors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were weighed only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included a reduction in financial aid and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following similar talks from the previous year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the US.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively complete any considered fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the administration’s signal at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new steadfast news from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on terms of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government’s executive, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History (disambiguation)
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller’s report from a special commission on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of law enforcement, of which there is now much evidence in public records.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller is reportedly also referring to whether Mr. Trump’s campaign contained a collusion with Russia to attack our elections.
Should there be a party swap in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to take responsibility before that body, just as he is preparing to face voters again, and eventually a jury made up of his colleagues would probably be waiting for him.
That’s a whole lot of “if” and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, all that was needed was for the Western powers to stand up to him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the inexorable course of democracy.
Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in the spotlight since the news reported that he had suggested secretly recording the president last year and speculated that he was not in a medical condition to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, The Times's versions are inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite convincing sexual assault allegations and perjury?
Most importantly, are we going to vote mid-term for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will have a long dark night.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, on the Sabbath, she sent me to light candles on the swastika table.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about a clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month would give them great hope for advancement from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing on the pitch for the first time this season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the fight with the belief that we could grab something and we took a point.
Maybe we could have multiplied it at the end, but overall the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we improved and we were better.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope that we can get three points, but it will be difficult because they played a good result in the last match, but with the spectators behind my back, I am sure that we can push and it will turn out well.
“Last year was pretty tough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team is strong and the guys are really enjoying it, the training is good too.
I hope we put our heads on it now, put last season behind us and be successful."
Women Worried About Savings for Retirement
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talked about it with family members.
Approximately half of the people in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t want to talk to them,” Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company, said in a statement.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare a family for care unless you tell them your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: An advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, with traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance to help you pay for these expenses, or with your own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have the money.
Create your own legal documents: Prevent legal battles while you can.
Appoint a health care representative, who will be a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that the doctors comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate yourself.
Also consider writing a power of attorney for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will ensure that your accounts are paid in case you are not qualified to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your grandparent urgently needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake, but what are the names of the attending physicians, for example?" Martin asks.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said the death toll is expected to rise further.
Since the communications were out of service, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggalu have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the Donggale tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Circle of Fire and earthquakes occur regularly.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit the south of Indonesia’s most populous island of Java and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, and caused a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake struck Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh Province and caused destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 died due to falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, a 29-year-old resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disrupting reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin's phone was taken away.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt "absolutely innocent" when asked to comment.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and fined up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a class B offense, which is punishable by a one-day jail term and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently pending before an Alaskan court for war veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, disruption of reports of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
He allegedly slapped his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of war veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are shut down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck a part of the island of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There were videos on social media depicting the moment of disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Extraordinary Death Penalty for NYC Terrorist Suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people — an exceptional sentence that has not been given for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly attacked a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October using a rented Home Depot truck to sweep away pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted a number of injuries – this is how the terms of the intent to grant the death penalty are defined, according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both of these numbers would imply the possibility of imposing the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 felonies, including charges of murder in favor of blackmail commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipo's act was carried out as abhorrent, cruel and perverse.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadta, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnucáv."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the Southern District of New York last handed down the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed, who had been proven to be a conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs sat in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal regret during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he felt good about what he had done.
Saipov said he was inspired to commit the attack by watching Islamic State videos on his phone.
Police said he had also demanded that the Islamic State flag be raised in a hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutors’ decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for anyone affected,” Patton said.
A team of Saipov’s lawyers had previously asked prosecutors not to call for the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say he should be tasked with Brexit negotiations NIGEL FARAGE
During today’s protest at the Conservative Party conference, Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the army of the people.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party has said that politicians must “feel pressure” from Eurosceptics – as suggested by one of May’s own MPs, he should be leading the negotiations with the EU.
Ordinary Conservative MP Peter Bone said in a march in Birmingham that the UK “would be out now” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the problem Mrs May faces in reconciling her ranks, where there is a deep rift, has been highlighted by the conservatives fighting to stay in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan under attack from Brexit supporters, supporters of staying in the EU and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will continue to seek an agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone announced that Leave Means Leave would gather in Solihull, where he wanted to “give up the Chequers.”
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
'If he were in charge, we'd be out today,' he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will stand for Brexit, but we have to give up on Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight world wars to have to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people would change their minds and want to stay is utterly wrong.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, and he is not liked by our party members or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be elected.
Forget Chequers and start listening.’
In a blunt message to Mrs May, she says, “Prime Ministers will keep their seats when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said conservative politicians must “get into an awkward situation” if they want to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re standing here today to tell them, ‘We won’t let you do that.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country that secured our victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud UK that rules itself.”
Proponents of staying in the Union marched through Birmingham in the meantime and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners to the Conservatives against Brexit after the start of the party's operations over the weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security issues with the party’s application after the conference began.
“These are the people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's all a farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to 'Think Carefully' for Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "think carefully" about running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican deputy Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has found herself at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s action in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the city hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, including a woman in the highest place.
The suspect in the shooting of Sims from the LSU was arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in Friday's shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. ET news conference.
A video of Friday's shooting was released requesting the identification of the man caught on tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that was incompatible with life," Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the 247sports news website on Saturday.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to moving around the scene, carrying a gun, and confessing to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was swept away without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-6-inch Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which were last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the world title when team directing handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished qualifying for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ team leadership would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the pole position and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the depot and let Hamilton catch up with the wagons circling on the tail of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider went to the depot a lap later, and after the exit he placed behind Vettel. However, Hamilton moved forward and in a close match, the Ferrari driver had to reluctantly leave the inner track free in order to defend himself in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen stepped out of the back row and was in the lead at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead for much of the race as he kept the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and be able to take Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
In the end, he went to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
“The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places,” Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday’s rally for insisting she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead declaring that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “bad and disgusting and lying.”
"One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see that anger, when you see these people, how angry and angry and disgusting and lying they are," he said.
“If you look at the release and the publication and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you responsible for the escape?
Remember her answer... you published the document -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... No, not at all,” he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the information leaked in early September – but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose the case," Feinstein said, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, she did not seem to believe the president, who spoke about the case at a meeting on Saturday night: “I can tell you that it is a really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court judge nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, and suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power back by any means available.
You see the meanness, the abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to put down to get back to power and take the helm,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars corrected Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's rematch in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took the lead thanks to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to make it home before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard then leveled again for Dundee, after which two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen insured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for the team Adam Keefe, who managed to beat Belfast Dundee 2-1 on Friday.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season, with all three previous games being dominated by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, 3:35, assisted by Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got the home team back in the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt set up a goal for Cowny, which he matched at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the booths for the first break, after all, in the lead, when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again managed to equal the goal from the power play in the time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen swing the lead to Dundee's side for the first time in the second quarter, and the same player insured his team's lead in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost the fourth of their last five games, will play another game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
An air traffic controller has died to allow hundreds of people on board to escape an earthquake.
Indonesia's air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died overseeing the plane with hundreds of people on board to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after Friday's earthquake on the island of Sulawesi caused a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that the colleagues of 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung ran to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in the wildly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped down from the control tower, thinking he was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, told ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which transported him to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pal.
“Our hearts are broken by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for dealing with the disaster said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll continues to rise as many bodies remain unrecovered under the wreckage and many of them still have not been reached by rescuers,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves in the devastated Pal have reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft are bringing aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies here.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks necessary to evacuate.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crash in lagoon in Micronesia
The airline operating the flight, which crashed in a lagoon on one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific, now said one person was missing, initially stating that all passengers and crew of 47 people had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was unable to locate one passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details about this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at an airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in care on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before landing.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
"That was terribly good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to get through the water belt deep to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew were panicking and screaming, and that he himself had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers working nearby on landscaping helped rescue the ship with an inflatable boat carrying passengers to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that a total of 111 people have died in PNG aircraft crashes over the past two decades, but no accident has occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The indictment ended its speech on Saturday in a case in which a man was repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
A jury analyst sketched the scenario using cell phone records from defendant 29 Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was in Chambers' company on the night of her death, contrary to his previous statement, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the cell phone data showed that he had spent the evening with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by police.
Sanford stood before the council and testified that he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another disagreement was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks on the day she died.
However, cell phone records show that the two had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it completely from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to appear before a jury later that day.
High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The band High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved since its inception with political messages and solutions to social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and re-popularize conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a revival in the recent past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?
NY nurse sues couple for firing after ‘racist’ text message
A New York City nurse is suing the couple for their discriminatory dismissal after she received a mistaken text message from her mother, in which she was labeled as “another black woman” in a text message.
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when on her first day at work in 2016 she found out that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEEÉÉE, OTHER NEGRO," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
When she understood her fake passport, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, saying that her African-American nurse was working really badly and was expecting a Filipina instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for being fired from work and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month engagement she was initially hired for, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not happening,” she told The Post this Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
However, the pair retaliated, arguing that they were not racists, but that terminating Ms. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they feared they could no longer trust her after the insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you put your child in the hands of someone you treated rudely, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “blackmail” and said his wife was nursing a two-month-old child and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Would you drive someone like that?
That’s not a good thing,” said the investment banker.
Although the lawsuit is still ongoing, the jury on social media very quickly condemned the couple for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of Paddington’s stories feared readers would not identify with the talking bear, recent reports show
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s acceptance, told the reporter: “It’s hard to empathize with someone who is reading it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s really fun to know now that we know Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, adding on the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, which became a "sweet bittersweet" dot after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as a “very important member of her family,” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, never boasting," she said.
“But because Paddington was such a real character for him, it was like having a kid who accomplished something you can be really proud of.
I think he looked at Paddington's success with that look.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his achievements only to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louise Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn't expect her to get out of it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nada telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart running were slowly losing their effectiveness and leaving her body.
She died shortly afterwards, and it was as if everything had closed down.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it to myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without revealing what a difficult test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down, tears running down my cheeks all the time.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt an overwhelming understanding of Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Women Send Postcards to Prevent Bridge Suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out postcards of the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to look for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any other parent to have to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up any room.
However, before his death, he left his job because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling’s immobile body after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis says, “I’m constantly worried about how this will affect his life.”
Ms. Davis suggested postcards “to inform people that they have people available who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they are their friends.
Don’t sit quietly – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davies's old friend, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he was feeling down or depressed, nothing at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Eve – when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t even look at them, nothing.”
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that they have to gradually get over it: “This kind of thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the balance as the FBI launches its investigation
“I thought we could get something he was actually asking for – an investigation in time of constraints, with limited scope – we could bring a little bit of unity into it,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “disintegrate” because both sides would guerrillaly bury themselves in their positions.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away from us, on 6 November, and if the Republicans behave badly as expected, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in their attempts to get the man they want to sit in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush telephoned senators, lobbying them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles their report?
The Senate will vote on it, and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the draw and confirm it with the Supreme Court.
Refugee numbers from North Korea 'decreased' under Kim
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has fallen since the beginning of Kim Jong-un’s rule seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said there had been 1,127 escapes in the past year — compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park also said that this was due to stricter controls at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates required by smugglers at the border.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are now being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations – which are technically still at war – have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the halted denuclearization talks.
This took place at the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive terms of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States of not making any progress on sanctions.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally allow ourselves to be disarmed,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said his temperament made him unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remark in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if any woman ever performed such a show, they would call it ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while both were still in their teens.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking when discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying their accusations against him were a “grotesque and coordinated attack” organized by liberals who failed to pass through Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he was unable to work for the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh's impeachment if confirmed, even if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling Congress the truth, he’s not qualified to serve not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court he’s working on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential earnings in court under the Acceptable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
As part of the hearings preceding his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would reverse some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There’s no time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to just say, ‘Oh, that’s beautiful,’” Pelosi said.
Women have to rule it.
After months and years of utterances, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continues: “A woman who was a director somewhere helped me a lot and told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “You may think that I am crying because I am sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she continued.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of responding to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office dominated by men. Once I expressed my unspeakable anger with tears. But the older, always cold manager, whom I always feared a little bit, grabbed me by the neck and pulled me up the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an illegitimate affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from combat, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
“There were seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been running for a long time at the time, she could not keep up with the collection of donations, so she undertook not to start the match unless she earned $ 2 million from the donations.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would give her just $250.
"Does he think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally run the campaign, she was completely overwhelmed by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism that she completely suffocated with anger.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder said of the reaction of the press.
"And you might think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they might write on my tombstone.
"Crying?"
Why China-US trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the gap between the countries will be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
But most of the major escalations saw the light of day this week with the announcement of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), virtually taxing half of China’s trade exports to the US.
Beijing has always reacted, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of U.S. imports of $60 billion in goods.
China has tried to repay the US with the same coin, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to fall to its knees.
While China would have wanted Washington to return to its original tracks, it would have meant giving way to its demands, but public submission to US demands would have been absolutely humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, a U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact is that swift policy decisions by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic splinter in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have so far admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria Ready to Return Refugees, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready to return refugees voluntarily and is appealing for help to rebuild a country devastated by a more than seven-year war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation in the territory is more stable and safer due to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists into a normal state.
Now all conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance to build the devastated country.
But he said he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe responds decisively to victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Evria won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of difficulty in France.
The U.S. has now lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then blew the ball into the water on 3 pairs of the 16th hole and ceded the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari then shone in all of his laps and became one of the 4 players, achieving the best 5-0-0 result since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was defeated by the 5th and 4th lowest-rated European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World-ranked player Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who apparently passed his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the best European player overall with 25.5 points earned in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy, that I got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who has won the 14 greatest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The U.S. team has struggled all weekend to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have demonstrated top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning, we have really warmed Europe to the heart.
We really didn't make it.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, I'm glad I was able to be their captain.
I really need to get off.
You beat us."
Red tide update: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to an overall drop in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, spots of flowering water are now reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts – this suggests a declining concentration.
The blooming waters of the red tide span about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The spots were observed about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week there were relatively fewer spots.
A red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
In the district of Hillsborough, low to high concentrations were observed in the open sea, the lowest to high concentrations in the district of Manatee, the lowest to high concentrations near the coast or the high seas in the district of Sarasota, the lowest to medium concentrations in the district of Charlotte, the lowest to high concentrations in the district of Sarasota, the lowest to medium concentrations in the district of Charlotte
Respiratory irritations continue to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
