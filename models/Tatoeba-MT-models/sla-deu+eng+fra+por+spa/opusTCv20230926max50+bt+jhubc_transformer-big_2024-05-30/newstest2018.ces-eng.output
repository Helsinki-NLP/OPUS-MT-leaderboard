The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued warnings for colored people traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state principles and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Travel Recommendation for Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents currently occurring across the state,” the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said it took this step on the basis of current Missouri laws that make it difficult to defend racist-motivated acts before a court, as well as as a result of the actions of law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
“Civil rights are being violated.
People are stopped by police just because of their skin color, they are attacked or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have the largest number of complaints so far."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated insults directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in disputed circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and was taken into custody by police without being charged with a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, which states that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared – they should bring money with them to pay bail, or let their relatives know they’re going to travel the country.”
According to current FBI reporting numbers, there were 100 cases of hate crime in Missouri in 2015, ranking the state 16th among all states.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows government officials to detain people on the grounds of violating the law, which the ACLU says is meant to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but lately advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family still has no peace of mind after 12 years!
Model Sally Anne Bowman was murdered.
A Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant where she worked, who stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana together, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the rigorous forensic work of searching the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in 2008 for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting a teenager in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl lying dead on the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were arguing the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even caught the attention of the taxi driver," he claimed falsely.
According to his testimony, the girl should have defended herself as best she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and she accused him.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about his horny and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt comfortable and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's house, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told the police.
He said he felt the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been injured four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people out there digging these graves.
'So our daughter is no longer there, 'Linda, the mother of the deceased girl, told The Mirror about the disappearance of the ash urn.
Linda was waiting for the assailants, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are not prudent or conservative," says Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE>, who runs Prague's Intimity boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
It started quietly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> went on a cycling trip to Moravia with his friends.
One of them brought not only a bike, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
"All sorts of moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me over lunch.
His friend and another companion decided to work with the German manufacturer of design erotic tools Fun Factory, which intrigued Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When a partner left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs the Intimity boutique in Benediktská Street in Prague, where he sells erotic gadgets in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't he?
These are also design items.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Come on, don't be such puritans!
Designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, the Fun Factory in Berlin served as an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic business than everyone here is used to.
No hidden displays, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like in a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka began to think about how to accommodate the Prague business, where it should be and what its name should be.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it's, you know, gentle," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the variant that spread the store into a garden of delights and a bedroom, which is dominated by a bed, won.
It was prepared by Dagmar <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the place in 2013.
At first he didn’t seem ideal because he wasn’t on the main street, but he was sitting next to the name of Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one is getting customers," says Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE>.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a business that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
They shouldn’t be embarrassed to enter such a business.
When I walked into the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn’t even feel like going to a sex shop.
Right at the door I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female waiter in the store, this does not mean that women are not shy to ask for help, it does not mean that a man's leg would not come here.
Generally, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually don't know how to estimate the right size and choose a bigger one," Martin smiles over a common mistake.
These are the prejudices, the old clichés, that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man of good faith chooses an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men prefer mostly black underwear, while women tend to prefer pink.
An absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
From the look on my face, it must be clear that I don’t know which beats, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's like a non-contact clitoral stimulator.
I have an adolescent urge to laugh with admiration at the serious tone with which the interpretation is given to me.
It's like it didn't fold.
And it doesn't actually crawl.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a seahorse-shaped vibrator.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a We-Vibe couple vibrator.
He completely broke the taboo that some men may still have, which is that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"There are different options," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
During a love affair, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of feeding vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose gadgets and buy classic vibrators, even though they only use them externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer to men,” says Martin.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." Mostly sold masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn’t look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but rather like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and the experience of using it.
In Japan it is completely different.
It amazes me.
I thought that Japanese women are very fond of erotic devices, I object.
"That's the internet reality," I explained.
Ordinary is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just for the sake of interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not at all prudents.
On the contrary, we are quite a welcoming nation.
Definitely unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical client of the store ranges from 35 to 50 years old and "already has some experience with both sex life and some gadgets.
Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka take care of her return by making sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to engage in specialties such as bondage and latex, because we do not have space for this, and it is not exactly suitable here.
Such things might discourage those we're trying to target.
Which are the people who have always been shy about going to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would come out on them.
Many of the products displayed on the shelves are really appealing.
This is also due to the selection of reputable brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awarded was the aforementioned seahorse' and this triggered a change in the entire industry.
They began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with health-friendly ones, they began to produce other designs, different colors...
Pleasantly, behind the design of some is the Czech, namely the popular designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how many people buy these Whoop.de.doo design items from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Venus balls by Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
She did a really huge amount of work by presenting within the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as schoolwork.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since this is not a large-scale production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
I may be going a little upstream, but it seems important to me to keep the development in our country in the Czech Republic.
It could happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna later describes the situation, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
There is no negative or negative attitude.
At most, people are embarrassed.
Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová currently offers a vibrator for which you can have a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubricating gel.
Vibration eggs and other novelties should be added in the next year.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what is right lie.
Is there anything that Martin hasn’t sold yet?
It's so hard to define.
What seems normal to one may seem completely abnormal to another, so we define ourselves rather by the assortment of branded manufacturers.
None of them go to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the most crazy demand they got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in asking for a masturbation aid for her friend with a natural length of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write to her that unfortunately we don't have anything like that.
The question is whether anyone was making fun of us," Martin measures me with a suspicious look.
And that happens from time to time...
A blow to Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dr<0xC3><0xBD> is struggling with a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is battling a disease that will steal people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately, that's true," the singer confirmed to Lightning himself.
I am aware of my illness and have managed to cope with it in the meantime.
"I'm taking medications to slow down the side effects of the disease," he added, thanking loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family gathered together to make life easier for Charles.
Wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, the daughters from the first marriage Zuzana and Tereza also come to the house of her father on White Mountain, and her son Karel, named Karlas, takes care of them.
<0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dr<0xC3><0xBD> fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him in his difficult treatment.
He has undergone sixty chemotherapy sessions.
He was able to return to work after them on the tennis court and on the ski slopes.
"I've been told by an astrologer that I'll be here by ninety," said Karel Blesku.
He's a warrior.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
Actress Kv<0xC4><0x9B>ta Violová is already fighting the same disease in the institute.

The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be reviewed by the OC.
There is still an absolute ban on abortion in Chile, so it must not be done for health reasons.
“I am sorry that lawmakers have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will be deciding on what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years,” said Senator Isabel Allende.
Chile’s Constitutional Court has 10 members and is expected to receive a new president by the end of August, according to AFP.
The law abolishing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would be challenged in court because it said it violated the right to life of the unborn child.
The vote on the bill was postponed by lawmakers last month until it was reviewed by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, MPs approved the proposal and the Senate did it again.
Under the new legislation, abortion should cease to be a criminal offence in three cases: if a woman’s life is at risk, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, before women were granted the right to vote in 1949, according to the Spanish newspaper El País.
An absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world that has an absolute ban on abortion.
Others include Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are now behind bars, serving up to 30 years in prison for abortion.
In many cases, it was a spontaneous abortion, according to human rights defenders, which the court described as murder.
Is there anything more sacred?
Trump's White House target is the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is the criticism of sculptures.
Americans could talk about it as well as anyone else – see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s statue in Baghdad’s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime’s key proponents, certainly knew what was going on when he set out with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants.
It is fitting to add that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a mob of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its importance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, only 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acosta, saying, “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal afterwards, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is actually right, but as he said himself, this is not about history.
These are, above all, the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate in today's time - she invites not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let the downfall come to me, the poor, the free to breathe, the wretched worm in the midst of crowded cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “miserable worms” on our screens.
Miller was not trying to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the significance of the statue is part of a broad political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends who, after her death, sought to place a plaque with a poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, namely the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
Merging a poem with a woman’s image is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wing adherents have long sought to reverse that meaning.
Well-known commentator on Trump’s rise to power, Rush Limbaugh, John the Baptist, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing American flames to the backward world: “The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Limbaugh, strangely, comes across an important thing.
The importance of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the perspective of an exhausted and damned traveler who, often after a long and frightening voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in his heart to a new land.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who are looking for shelter and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to stir up hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK Athletics Federation Director Neil Black said a strong squad of 16 Scots on the World Cup team would be "a huge benefit to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 World Championships in London, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that “something special is happening” in Scotland and that British athletics could learn little from the Scots.
“We’re trying to understand and adapt — we’re going to work on that,” Black said.
“I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will aspire to medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing,” Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scottish or non-Scottish, came out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and unconcealed feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was "unbelievable" that the British team had 16 Scottish athletes.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Muir has set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
He will compete in the 1500m and 5000m races.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500 m track. This season he won the British Team Races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, in which she was the only other Scottish member of the team, Lee McConnell.
The team captain said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues got into the team, but in many cases they will also attack the participation in the final and the medal.
“The extraordinary thing about being a team captain is that I was elected by the other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is a pleasure,” she added.
“Obviously, I’m very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
It proves where we've gone.
They are athletes who will think of the front seats on the podium.
And my opening remarks?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year’s championship, because it is held at home.
It is important to take advantage of the support of local fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium.
I got a second chance to race and I’m going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere.”
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t Apply for Public Office if You Can’t Take the Criticism of Voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for newspapers to criticize him for anything from domestic politics to his political views.
That criticism didn’t leave her cold.
But he did not try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech may be taken away from us—and the stupid and dumb will be led like sheep to the slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland, to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on acting like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The governor’s employees dismissed the lawsuit as groundless, and many “who cares” opinions appeared in comments on the Internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is a hugely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second-highest popularity among all 50 governors.
Hogan's not annoying.
As can be seen, he manages his state with certainty of his own and strictly adheres to the principles.
He also turned out to be adept at using Facebook as the main means of connecting with his constituents – the exception is not the publication of the first bare-headed photo after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum labeled official and managed by his employees paid with taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor, saying the blocking of comments was done as a moderation of posts.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who had been deleted from the posts.
And that's exactly what they are - real people talking to their elected leaders; a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi lawyer Sarma Ramani, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I have politely noted that I am disappointed by his insufficient response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the Washington Post's comments section.
“I don’t like the idea that when a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting the so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s staff called “focused spam interest” would probably be called “defense.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would have required the dispatch of employees to the streets, where they would have collected and burned all the copies with criticism or arrested or silenced the Protestants.
And that is exactly what is happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors has violated the first amendment in Alexandria, where she prevented one voter from accessing her Facebook page, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington’s time, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even back then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected by people as part of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were accumulating in his office criticizing his stance on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundations of our nation.
And a real leader has to accept it.
Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, they consume more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariffs than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, they have more time to browse the web, and under an umbrella, they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
That’s according to O2’s latest statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available on a flat-rate basis than at home.
Therefore, it is not surprising that in Croatia, where the minimum number of our visitors travels during the winter, data consumption has increased even fiftyfold this summer season.
In the second place in the ranking of consumed data then placed Italy.
Most of the time, Czechs make calls from Germany, where many of them go on business even during the summer.
According to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited annually by 800,000 Czechs, making it our most popular holiday destination.
People here, however, exchanged the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s record was July 7.
“The transferred data would contain tens of millions of photographs,” said Silvia Cieslarová, O2’s mobile director.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighboring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
"Through Austria, the Czechs are heading towards the Adriatic," said Cieslarová.
While the operator’s data has seen high year-on-year growth following the release of roaming charges, the growth for telephones is much lower.
The number of minutes called in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
Germany dominates here with a huge lead over other countries.
"Roaming calls are used more by business customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, Scotland, which hosts the 25th annual Scottish Senior Open, over the next three days.
Ronan Rafferty, who is from Northern Ireland, died last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals in the role of Paul Eales as the tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club grow slowly before my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in good hands.”
Eales will defend the title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when winning meant a lot to me and my wife Sharon.
It was a beautiful time that I will never forget.”
Gary Orr has joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating his 50th birthday this year.
This event will be his first participation since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play at home," Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want to be successful and feel pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I’m doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far.”
The three players will also be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. The parking fee is <0xC2><0xA3>5 per car with one passenger and <0xC2><0xA3>10 per car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds will go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pan.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he removes the potato and tastes it with unwashed hands.
The bard sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where he also performs his daily tasks, such as washing his laundry in muddy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof replaces the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any fields to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers are stationed in the village.
"After five o'clock in the afternoon, no one dares to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public hand-lift in front of the occupying army.
The current anti-Dutch protest movement quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which ruled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and devastated city, which can be reached after a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach-clutching ride.
Public transport does not work at this place.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners had ever visited this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," Bardina says, pointing to her colorful, hand-knit turban, dark T-shirt, and shiny skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province – 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and its child mortality and literacy rate is one of the worst in all of Asia.
It is also the gold of Indonesia.
The world’s largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran Company of the U.S. Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai – a rocky province roughly the size of New Jersey, home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports logging with an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005 found that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for a single officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
The massacres in the tribal area of Papua during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that took place last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — according to another report, electrocution and rape are particularly popular — and the brutal repression of peaceful protesters.
“It’s hard to count the number of casualties because incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources attracted colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% profess Christianity, but the demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"The natives of Papua - mother-mother (women) - thus lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised in his 2014 presidential campaign to address inequality and rights violations.
The former carpenter also secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta in 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and the local people feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would listen to our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles emerged from the darkness of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this rebuke and the tone with which it was spoken, and later returned with four other soldiers, said local parish priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state chased a group of children and beat them with their guns, according to victims and witnesses of the incident.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
Hours later, a nearby election commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football pitch in front of a local police station and army headquarters to demand justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - in which they run in a circle and imitate the singing of birds - of the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Several protesters began to throw stones at buildings.
As tensions intensified, the soldiers received an order via radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot,” according to an official document published by TIME, the content of which was never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Enarotali district of Kego Koto, recognized the impending danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one paid attention to his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting," he added.
One local resident, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,” Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
A Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only “securing” the station that was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” said a spokesman for the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped with injuries.
The news of the killings spread through the Jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his sympathy for the families of the victims and promising to deal with violence in Papua.
“I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it never happens again,” he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve past violent acts.
Almost immediately, however, the excuses began to sound.
“Most of the violence happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
In an interview with TIME in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto said he had no plans to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, “all cases will be brought to court.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" based on more than 1,000 deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been resolved so far, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his claim with disbelief.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but I haven't seen anything yet," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
A few years later, he is still living in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai, who are worried about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army began to look for me," he said.
And the shooting hasn't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
A skirmish in which one person was killed and another 17 were injured occurred between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, villagers threw stones at the officers and the answer was a warning shot.
But locals say a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
"I haven't left the house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of insurgents that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the leaders of OPM come from Paniai. These include Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks in recent years, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of residents of Paniai, all under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty adds oil to the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
The bread is unreachable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began flowing into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already so few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education they need to get into business.
“Young people are moving out of villages due to lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of Paniai’s tribal council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp - were expelled from Papua New Guinea for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they had been granted such a rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi, in his election campaign promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
“Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost regions of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in the Papua case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands — urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread acts of violence” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
Indonesia’s foreign ministry spokesman, Armanatha Nasir, dismissed the accusations when he told reporters in Jakarta: “Indonesia still has a democratic system and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals called out, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan “we want freedom”.
In 2019, Indonesia has another election planned, but the Papuans say they won’t vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but surrounded by people associated with the Paniai shooting," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a looting army - are lurking in poverty, miserable education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote to be a "debt" that must be repaid to Jokowi.
“They don’t want money, they want justice,” he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims of the Panai shooting, they continue with the last symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the plot opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has intercepted a massive shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy seized a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
A four-member crew of the ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was towed by police to the port of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
Australia’s intelligence agency said it would work with its international partners to pinpoint where the drugs were coming from and to expose the “Lithuanian syndicate.”
“We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures taken to stop large quantities of drugs heading to Australia,” said Col Blanch, the country’s executive director.
Drugs were destroyed in Nouméa this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for drug smugglers because of its high street prices.
The country also faces the problem of a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
So the current raid is not the first one lately.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
According to the doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, the solution could be infusions of saline, which are injected with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are currently only used in medical facilities.
The older a person gets, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"In addition, they lose the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," Mádlová said.
You should definitely drink two liters.
"But getting so much fluid into the old man is a big problem," she added.
In the elderly, it is often not looked after by a doctor.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually dealt with by infusions.
"I think it should be gradually introduced there, too, so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of saline can be delivered to elderly people per day.
Lack of fluids can cause nausea, headache, and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In case of negligence, it can lead to a stroke.
Blood thickens and blocks a blood vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a blanket, a maximum of cotton sheets.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more demanding for nurses, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient from time to time and let the skin ventilate," she said.
The Torch skyscraper burns in Dubai for the second time
In Dubai, one of the largest residential skyscrapers in the world caught fire on Friday, with firefighters having to evacuate all residents of 337 meters high and 79-story buildings.
In the last two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We were asleep and the alarm woke us. We heard screams.
It took us ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” said Geroge, one of the skyscrapers’ residents.
Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4 a.m. (00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they are providing replacement accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could once again spark a debate about the safety of materials used to lining high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation that started the construction of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged were the cladding and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the grenfell tower's insulation and lining system could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in a June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
More than one in five U.S. passengers carry prohibited items on board an airplane.
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the US government’s Transportation Security Administration’s checkpoints on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers said they found out late that they had traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. — to which more than 1,000 respondents responded — showed that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly attempting to travel with an item prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand hours of flight time, compared to less than 15 percent of Gen X members.
The most common items that escaped the attention of the TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents knowingly carried a sharp object through the security, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men also admitted to deliberately carrying illicit drugs on board the aircraft.
The company said it conducted research among travelers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally carried unauthorized items through airport checks and how many did so deliberately.
Unsurprisingly, most people who have carried unauthorized items – whether consciously or unconsciously – travel by plane very often.
As the company emphasized, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids and how much they can carry into the plane.
So it’s no surprise that the TSA has seized the largest amount of the currently banned liquid.
For a time, people thought that the TSA would treat books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Transportation of liquids is allowed on domestic flights, not international ones.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt postpones Obama administration emissions reduction directives
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 states, its chief, Scott Pruitt, revoked his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration’s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes to his plan to respond more rapidly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not, however, mention a legal challenge against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This refers to the latest deadline set for 1 October, when states should begin to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interference with local decisions or imminent economic growth.”
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma’s state attorney general before President Donald Trump’s appointment as EPA chief, has long served as a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
Wednesday’s sudden turnaround is the biggest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA executor exceeded his authority in an effort to delay the Obama administration’s inclusion of a plan that required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA’s commitment to working with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given time frame.
“Under the previous administration, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set up the plans,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
“We don’t believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines very seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it.”
However, the EPA said Pruitt could use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” at some point to ensure that regulations “are based on sound policies and the most available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive rewrite of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed a coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group was not going to allow legal coercion.
“The turnaround in the EPA’s views – following our court case – is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman said in a statement.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants, and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are appreciative of Pruitt’s sudden change.
“It’s worrying how much pressure needs to be exerted to change the mindsets of responsible people and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, which seeks to help polluters and special interests.”
He spilled acid on the man, yet he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you’re at home with your family and you’re laughing, the next your whole life will suddenly change from the ground up.
And worst of all, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was sealed with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door of the Christopheros family.
Andreas stood up to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door that was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man, whom he had never seen in his life, immediately after opening without warning, poured acid on him with the words: "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I just felt an incredible pain on my skin,” Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones heard the terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
For several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent were affected by the face, which doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
The loss of eyelids became a major complication for Christopheros.
It's probably the most distressing thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said.
Today, Christopheros has had 12 surgeries, which are far from the last.
According to plastic surgeons, injuries suffered by victims of acid attacks can require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment.
Even after difficult and long-term treatment, the victims have scarred tissue for the rest of their lives.
“Sometimes people don’t recover and spend their whole lives fighting deformation and disfigurement,” said Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was mistaken.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed he was taking revenge on the man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police thoroughly investigated the case and subsequently tracked down the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the astonishment of the Christopher family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges ultimately concluded that the sentence should be abolished because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of infections with corrosive substances has increased considerably.
The interior ministry said it planned to provide new guidelines to prosecutors on the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
Victims of such attacks, however, do not intend to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose tougher and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for tighter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as they are different cleaning agents.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, residents of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upstairs.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out at the top floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We slept together.
We were awakened by the alarm, people were screaming.
"We were running downstairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," George said.
Another CNN witness estimated that about 40 apartments were on fire.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when they were hit by burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to the Civil Defense, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its occurrence is not yet known.
Witnesses said there was a power outage in the surrounding buildings.
A massive fire damaged Dubai’s The Torch skyscraper in February 2015, destroying more than 100 homes.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then, no one was harmed, as the residents managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and became the world’s tallest residential building at 352 meters.
Another Dubai skyscraper deprived him of the record the following year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, the sample of 23-year-old Ippolit contained a varied collection of illicit drugs, ranging from steroids to diuretics to medications for Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year distancing and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record amount in athletes caught.
The third-league player had started taking steroids the year before, he said, when he had fallen into bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondrá<0xC4><0x8D>ková in the Czech Republic.
She hugged her ex-lover passionately!
Lucka Vondrá<0xC4><0x8D>ková has barely entered the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
It also attracts attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, with whom she lived for three years.
At the time, the actor was 12 years older and wanted to have a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly did not want to hang her career on a nail.
So they left each other, but they remained friends to this day.
This was also demonstrated at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both blended into blue.
At first they didn't notice each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes until she clutched her stomach.
Then they hugged and willingly posed for the photographers.
Their meeting was not a coincidence, however, as they will play together a lover couple in the new series Prima Captain Exner.
Islamists have been sentenced to life imprisonment in the UK for plotting an assassination.
A British court on Thursday jailed four members of an Islamist cell dubbed the Three Musketeers who, according to prosecutors, were planning a terrorist attack against police and the military.
Four men, two of whom had attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar crimes, were arrested in August last year.
At the time, authorities believed he was about to launch an immediate attack.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "infidels" in Arabic, and a mock-up gun.
It happened when a MI5 agent was putting a listening device in the car.
“The recent assassinations have shown the horror that the defendants could have caused if they had not been stopped,” prosecutor Sue Hemming said in a statement.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men pleaded not guilty and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the allegations of the defendants.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
In Hodonín, they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at its peak for just two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice in Hodonín, it was surpassed by Thursday, which became the warmest day of the year so far.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or evened at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measurement stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice the temperature on Thursday was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the B<0xC5><0x99>eclav region, Thursday’s 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree, and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as in the case of Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, came from 2013.
In the west, it was 10 degrees less.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, the highest heat was in Dyjakovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí in B<0xC5><0x99>eclav, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the website of the Czech Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Thursday’s highest temperatures have so far been only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures started to rise there only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and more significant rains may come on Sunday.
In most parts of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China is lacking in tourists.
Beijing is losing billions due to visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends ten billion dollars a year supporting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
This is not happening in Beijing.
Local state media talk about a plan to turn tourism into a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, the situation in the world’s most populous country is assessed by Professor of Economics from the University of Beijing Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is China’s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, while the citizens of the other countries have to settle their visas in advance.
In the U.S., crowds are comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait for it for long hours in a queue, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such constraints create significant economic barriers.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance found that visa requirements reduce a country’s number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and is home to less than one percent of its population, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often exacerbates the problem itself when it uses tourism to pursue its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift over South Korea’s missile defense system, the South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an increase of 85 percent.
This affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the US central bank, the Fed may have left China for as much as $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China receives about $35 billion a year as part of the sale of currency to incoming tourists.
According to official balance-of-payments figures, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China's total surplus in trade in goods.
Thus, the small number of tourists to the country, which anxiously prevents the outflow of capital, is inflicting a very painful blow.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of a more general abstinence towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners in China.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants tend to revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You will not find them in China.
It will be politically challenging to solve these problems, but the step that is being proposed is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce the cost of visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen zoo they multiplied deadly poisonous reptiles.
Plze<0xC5><0x88>'s Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the young of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters above sea level.
"It grows to a metre in length," zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba said.
In the meantime, the young of the other two species, the mortals and the red cobra, will be gaining strength in the breeding background of the garden.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We don't want to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian snake-killers were born, descendants of a breeding pair native to the Sydney area.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the lethal killers from the Perth area," Vobruba said, adding that in human care it is necessary for the lethal killer to winter for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
One hundred percent success was achieved by a swarm of African spitting red cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen zoo hatched from four eggs a total of four cubs.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
In the wild, this species ejects poison on its prey, up to a distance of four meters.
It is aimed at the eyes and can cause permanent blindness.
In the zoo, the cubs of all three species feed on the holata mice.
Within 40 days in the garden, they still expect the hatching of cubs from a black mamba husk, the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the phone conversation, Trump is creating pressure on Mexico over the payment for the border wall
The Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The president reproached him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like that in the press.”
Trump has pledged to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico will pay for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also leaked, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. deal to oversee refugees heading to Australia is “ridiculous” and “stupid” and insisted that if he agreed to such a deal – which came about under President Obama – he would look “drug” after he proposed a ban on refugees entering the U.S.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk again testified at the prosecutor's office about Smolensk.
"There is nothing to be afraid of," Jaroslaw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski, the brother of the deceased president and head of the PiS government's Law and Justice party, told Tusk.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me," Tusk said, accusing the country's current leadership of trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
When leaving the prosecutor’s office, a crowd was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24, who chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician 100 years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me."
According to her, she does not blame prosecutors, but she does not doubt that the justice system should serve as a tool for the current Polish rulers against rivals, the opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
It was the second time he had been questioned.
The ex-premier was questioned by the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time it was supposed to be about mistakes in the autopsies of victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, the bodies in the coffins were replaced.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been reasons.
And the reason was that they feared a scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was supposed to serve Donald Tusk to become someone very important in the EU," Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski told Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would jeopardize Tusk’s chances of getting the most important seat in the union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk could have different outcomes, but she did not take note.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office on April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many saw his summons as part of an apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
In Poland, the prosecutor’s office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who serves as the Attorney General.
The subpoena came shortly after Tusk was elected president of the European Council, which Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel’s visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested alone against the extension of Tusk’s mandate.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has also left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the House of Representatives from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It comes from a decree regulating the delivery of ballots abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update and is currently under review.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry said.
"In some countries, new representation offices have been established, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has changed," the document says.
The Decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative offices to which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
Another one hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the version for the press.
It is their list that is being changed by decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe, for example.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic has also suspended its presence in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will also be no vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are on the list of embassies in Kenya’s Nairobi, Senegal’s capital Dakar and Zambia’s Lusaka.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include a consulate-general in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan.
Voting passes will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to elect MPs in the polling stations of the embassies or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the state election commission determines by lot the region for which candidates are voted for abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when the South Moravian candidates were chosen.
In the next two elections, Czechs abroad voted among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later 8,222.
Four years ago, 10,571 voters attended the embassies for early parliamentary elections.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Recall Racist Lynchings
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the spectators of Monroe, Georgia, and curled towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked his way.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, pulled his cigarette for a long time and stared at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want that n--- Roger!" the man shouted.
"Bring it to me!"
Silence is broken by the roar of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is a mere reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws the rope over Roger's neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have regularly returned to Moore’s Ford Bridge to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946 when two black couples – Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey – were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has been tried for the murders yet.
“It’s amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years – even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reconstruction of the event.
"It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic call to action. Every year, he reminds the Monroe community that justice has not been done enough.
“We demand prosecution and closure, peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” Brooks said.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin."
On July 27, 1946, a coroner covered one of the bodies of the victims of the lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were to take part in the lynching.
However, no one has been prosecuted so far.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates claim that the two reasons for the lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court of Georgia granted blacks the right to vote in elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
And it was during the summer election period that black farmer Roger Malcolm was supposed to stab white landlord Barnett Hester during a skirmish - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, it was a tradition in the city that Hester had been hanging out with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and had brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison filed a $600 bail against Malcolm.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and his cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their way back from prison, just outside the entrance to Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison," she said.
“It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and local law enforcement officers who not only took part in the lynchings, but also disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks made a brief statement on the matter.
“It was a massacre because of the right to vote,” he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all black locals: ‘this is how you end up if you register and go to vote.’”
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore’s Ford Bridge has been organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and concise, showing a deep-seated racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy, and it is even more difficult to turn your eyes away, but Greene says it makes sense.
“Nobody wants to talk about lynchings because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us,” Greene said.
"But we can't have a relationship unless you listen to what I've been through."
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - flocked to the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
He played the leader of the Kukluxklan for many years, but in his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history on a regular basis because we never want to go back to that time.”
Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a skirmish – Malcolm argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land n----e!"
You can't do Rascon.
There's a skirmish.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" Rascona asked.
He's confused.
Was I being too rude?
"No," Greene replied cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'n--r' in that tone."
'Exactly, 'said one of the black actors.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility will replace the feeling of closeness.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to make it worth it for the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word with N.
No one laughs anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The screams, the shots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of the actors and sings the mournful song of Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there is sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of all this, about a dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
In the audience there are practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple traveled all the way from Ithaca, New York, many of the spectators are from nearby.
Each of them endures the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in a crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, murders could have been viewed at a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynchings took place, the atmosphere is frightening.
With the final words of the song, Greene summons the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children kneel to the heads of the victims, watching the fake blood and immobile bodies and whispering something to their ears.
'They're not dead, 'said the little boy.
After a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two fellow actors and weeps in their arms; eventually, emotions overwhelm him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you're not comfortable with that role.
But you had a reason.”
Later that day, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple talks passionately about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find words to express her feelings for today's performance.
"It's hard to listen to the ugly words and look at the ugly acts... that people do who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said of the reconstruction.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topic,” she added, “just called police skirmishes.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom, enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning the show for the next year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience – but it’s also a moment to think about,” he said.
"If we don't learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it.”
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that only cowards read the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything was rather a rare phenomenon.
So, for example, my first turntable had only one piece of paper with hieroglyphics showing some components involved, all of which had some secret markings.
When something inside of me went wrong years later, I offered that charter to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a grin, he gave me some advice on what the labyrinth paper was suitable for.
Yes, it was the usual aid in chronic depletion of toilet paper.
Playfully he found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl pancakes again.
New times have brought new directions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where the sliced grapefruit simply stuck, required about ten pictures.
Especially successful was the sketch with a description of how to insert one part into another.
The set was two-piece and no other procedure was possible.
To give it the opposite required considerable effort with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for the manual ended with my Seat Leon self-propelled.
The year of production 2003 still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the flash bulb.
It was easy.
Three steps and the work was done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instruction omitted to mention that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
1. Separate the cover.
2. Screw out the cracked bulb and screw a new one.
3. Insert the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the inside of the car, I would find a spring, a screw with which I could easily move the cover, and then I would follow points 1-3 of the thrifty author of the service book.
Tram fault.
The cover had no place, no room even for the slender hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Slezan.
I have lost half an hour of my life, and without any success at all.
The situation was amplified by the entrance of my wife to the garage, which was summoned by the roar and words that she hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
'What are you doing here? 'she asked unmistakably.
My answer took about 90 seconds, however, if I skip the vulgar terms, there are only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And why are you taking so long?" she said, threatening what might be her last in a long-lasting relationship.
Slowly I explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the torture procedure of the author of the manual, where the blessing of the burning iron on the hand that wrote the manual, then her instruction that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to a wide range of instructions Hammers on witches, including his commission burnt over his commission burn.
'How 'bout taking the box off? 'the woman meant taking the battery off.
In sheer desperation, this happened, and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that was until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just recovering from a state of collapse after checking two officials of the State Drug Control Unit.
I know him as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can interpret even wild stories with an unexcited voice.
"Imagine I was fined for not having my hand-washing instructions posted," he told me in a faint voice.
Gradually I got rid of the whole problem, which was that above the washbasin in the toilet of patients does not have a picture of how to wash hands.
His argument to the commissioner that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that the need for pictograms to cope with the usual activity of decent people did not have a healing effect and cost him considerable money.
"It's not like that," she told him.
He understood that simply rinsing the soapy palms with running water is a primitive act at the Cro-Magnon level, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
Thus, it is necessary to inform that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end there is a joyful discovery that a person has washed his hands exactly as ordered by the hosudar from S<0xC3><0x9A>KL.
Finally, I have to note that I was inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the activity in the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there is no problem, with urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to hang two instructions.
The problem remains with those pictograms, because to create a perfect procedure means also an accurate sketch of all the anatomical details, which could arouse some indignation in a prudish visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that throughout his life he wiped the appropriate opening with a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson lays off an additional 3,000 employees and cuts dividends in a bid to revive business
Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut the temporary dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
The next wave of layoffs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will occur at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program in a bid to revive declining trade as digital education booms.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a 1 percent increase in core sales in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, NATO said.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh district.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bombing that killed more than 30 people in an explosion at a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that the blast occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by "a local person with a homemade explosive device".
The statement said all the wounded soldiers were safe and were at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the reporters, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO allies in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a major blast killed more than 150 people in the city centre, the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. forces overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to help troops and police in the country.
According to the reporters, the suicide attacks he has trained in recent weeks have shaken the public's trust in the government, its orders and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reconsidered its decision to postpone smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to postpone the Obama administration’s law ordering states to reduce emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to pass on the “Ozone Standards 2015” and said it was putting forward the agency’s commitment to cooperate with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will listen to their views,” EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s effort to delay the ozone standards – which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 of most democracies, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit Tuesday saying the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama, according to Trump, in an effort to kick-start economic growth.
But the new government’s efforts have launched countermeasures from Democrats and conservative groups, who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA says on its website that breathing ozone-containing air “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár was hit and blood flowed!
This, a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer held a monstrous event on Czech conditions, at which he hosted such prominent personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others.
The purpose was simple, to show myself to the public and to present my music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was attended by the just named personalities.
Few people already know that the shooting of the video, which took place in Russia, did not go without problems and singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first major filming with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and it did not go without a real embarrassment.
The song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, the singer's juice was supposed to suggest a slap in the face in the video.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and directly in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, my nose immediately bleeded," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not have time to react in time.
Luckily, the injury was not severe enough to affect the continuation of the filming.
We are bringing you the video clip of the young artist, you can also record the scene with the punch.
A failed version with blood, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, the two boxers who could have staged the world’s most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at Tuesday’s meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room in ESPN’s Los Angeles offices until Garcia – the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion – went down to the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime match, both boxers made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers are posing for photographers, and Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enka’s manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing duel would be “a perfect test.”
"I'm a former champion in the penis weight," Garcia adds.
“I had to put on weight because of the fight with Broner (67 kg), but I’m not that big.
I'm small on my 63 kg.
I would like to return to the lightweight category.
Lomachenko has to put on weight again to get to light weight... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why don't they do it."
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxing would be good for this game."
Klimas has made a request for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko is expected to make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in a match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell in the title of the 23rd.
“The game should be a pay-per-view style, that’s what fans are asking for,” said Garcia, who later said he was open to the possibility of broadcasting the game via the TV station that comes with the best deal.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else gets that much attention.
We’ll wait for the right opportunity.”
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as an "incredible boxer" and could participate in Saturday's match.
Lomachenko, however, did not give Garcia's praise when he said that the champion of the three divisions from Riverside looks "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and only then box.
Both boxers said they felt rising tension ahead of each other's duel.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other game has attracted so much attention.
And I will put it in the fire with great pleasure," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, “I’ve been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey.”
It's going to be a great game."
A young couple vanished 12 years ago without a trace.
Their car was found at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova, have been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
In the end, the police closed the investigation due to lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in the uncertainty of not knowing what had happened to the couple.
Twelve years later, the story ends sadly.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the city of Cheboksary, Chuvash.
Thanks to the documents that were left in the car, the police were able to identify the couple.
Documents have survived a decade underwater, without them it would have taken police much longer to determine the identity of those found.
The couple were last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The person who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksary police, who dragged the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe that the death of the young couple was caused by an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be released after its conclusion.
The latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people were asked as older than 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (R<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) started carrying out new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to assess applicants more accurately in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who had lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases for investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests carried out between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency judged the interviewee to be "possibly over 18 years of age".
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was “possibly under the age of 18.”
Tests are only taken if the age of the interviewee is disputed.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“As compared to last month, the statistics are kept in a tight track and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases it was found that “the person interviewed is 18 years of age or older”.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the interviewee stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
The medical method of determining age, which includes x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and radiologists, has also received criticism.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which, among other things, is engaged in assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age of puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age with accuracy, we shouldn’t pretend otherwise,” he told the Metro newspaper.
The forensic medical agency Agency's G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson defended the decision, saying: "Generally speaking, the risk of misjudgment of a child as an adult is low.
The highest risk is the fact that the person interviewed is just under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents.
Trump threatened the president of Mexico by phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to transcripts of the interviews published on Thursday by the American newspaper The Washington Post.
Trump has made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with Mexico’s president shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically rebuked Nieto for being critical of his plan to build the wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president not to publicly say his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump said repeatedly in an interview on Jan. 27, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continued to make defiant statements.
They say the funding will come up and eventually it will work out.
“But if you say Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to see you guys anymore because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
He called the wall the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it's probably the most important thing.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after taking power.
Mexico refuses to build and finance the 3,200-kilometer-long wall, which has strained relations between the two countries.
At the end of March, Trump said that the project will be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's January 28 phone call with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The White House said the conversation was ridiculous.
He was driven to this conclusion by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States taking in persons from internment facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later agreed to it.
“You can certainly say this is not the deal you made, but you’re going to have to stick to it,” Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jolly, for example, when Trump praised Australia’s refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation sharpened.
“I hate accepting these people,” Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
“They’re not going to be great people going to work for local dairy farmers,” he said.
In the interview, he also noted that the refugee could become a Boston assassin in five years.
At the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, Trump held telephone conversations with a number of world leaders, often several in a single day.
Turnbull's conversation was the least pleasant of the day.
Before ending the meeting, he said he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The murderer of Rana was executed before the crowd.
Her father was also watching.
The execution took place in the capital of Yemen, Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his victim the little Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body and threw it near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has affected an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed mob that gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
After the execution, the victim’s father told the media his feelings.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day in my life.
Other members of the family were present, shouting "Long live justice" with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was pulled.
The police put him tied up on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his weapon against him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The crowd was celebrating every shot that was fired.
Mr al-Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country’s legal system.
“Justice, Allah and Shariah have prevailed,” he added.
I was standing on Liberation Square in Sana'a waiting for the execution of my daughter's murderer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hatred madness, grab the murderer and lynch him.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shia Houthi.
Initially, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes after his arrest, but his actions caused such outrage that the judge decided for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl’s disappearance on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the cellar of his house, they found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the Wound.
"Our family has no enemies and the injuries that Rana's body carried were terrible," he told the media.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone believes that the police received a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of a horrific crime.
The girl’s mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter’s body had been found.
Rana used to go outside to play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took the cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we searched in vain.
Residents of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al-Maghrabi was detained, demanding immediate punishment.
A Justice Department deputy read the investigation to the crowd to reassure them.
The defendant did not seem to regret his actions.
Just before his sentence, the police read him the verdict, but the convict just glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but many recordings made by the crowd appeared on the Internet.
West Virginia Governor Announces Political Party Change
Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at a meeting of President Trump that he is moving to a different party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the governor said.
“Today, after much prayer and reflection, I tell you today, as a West Virginian, that I can no longer support you as a Democratic governor.”
The crowd of spectators exploded in joy.
"Tomorrow I'm going to join the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump has promised to make an important announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the country according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
His assets are estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday evening stating: “The Governor of Justice’s passing is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of helping to lift our country up.”
“For a Democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by the Governor of Justice is the last straw for an already wretched leaderless party that is in vain seeking to find positive and unifying news,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the sporting world.
The head of Russian athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Athletics Championships - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sports was the right thing to do and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into force in November 2015, after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) showed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
“I think today we saw a very sincere response and presentation,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire federation.”
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had adopted criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has been a very successful day and we have moved on to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis team to maintain the punishment that has been imposed on Russia,” Coe said.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
“Our goal has always been to separate the honest athletes from the dishonest ones,” he said.
At the World Athletics Championships, which will begin on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag who have met the strict rules of the IAAF.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before it was allowed back.
Drug tests are still unsatisfactory and the excluded trainers continue to operate, he told reporters in London after a presentation by the IAAF board.
The state contract CzechTrade was acquired by the company Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov, whose state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savov for tax fraud and demanded his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade announced a public contract for four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The order in the total value of CZK 30.8 million was received by the publishing house Mladá fronta of entrepreneur Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are prosecuting him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of the server Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
According to the original criteria of CzechTrade, the award was to be decided by 60 percent of the price offered and 40 percent of the beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion greatly helped Savov’s company.
According to Dotyk.cz, she received 100 points in all sub-quality criteria.
In the end, it moved her ahead of another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Mladá fronta operated with an amount of CZK 404,900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324,350.
However, unlike Mladá fronta, it received a below-average score of 62 points from assessors in all qualitative criteria.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the server Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, falls under the publishing house Economy.
VLM filed several objections against the result of the tender, arguing that its assessment was unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it was decided to challenge the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The Applicant is convinced that the Contracting Authority has reached a decision on the selection of the public procurement contractor on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the Applicant and other suppliers," reads the proposal for the initiation of the procedure filed at the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS this week, which was published by the server Aktu<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC4><0x9B>.
According to the General Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee seems to be unreliable and the assessment of the Mladá fronta project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors to be improbable and suspicious," he said.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is published in accordance with the law in the Client Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"At the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot comment on its course," the agency's media representative, <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded with a statement, according to which it considers it extremely problematic that the publishing house Economy has interfered with the article in Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in the competition, where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in the article.
The tender could have been helped by the fact that she provided the BusinessInfo portal with editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was awarded for the first time in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Kuba ODS.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov accuses the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech state allegedly damages of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its extradition since 2014.
According to Savo, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, is behind his criminalization, under whose influence the publishing house Mafra falls.
Last year, a London court rejected Savov’s appeal against extradition, but the entrepreneur appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the UK about the acquisition of legal force of the judgment to date," spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová told Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Mladá fronta, Savov was in the Cyprus-based company Harvestor Limited, which controlled the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
He should also control the bankrupt Heavy Machinery Services company, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the withdrawal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker rode along the sidewalks and the park, ended up in the roller skates.
The biker attracted attention by reckless driving on streets, sidewalks and park paths in <0xC3><0x9A><0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
When the patrol began to chase him, he decided to run away in the direction of the Station.
"Police officers pursued the man cautiously through the city when, on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>, he was unable to drive and entered the field where he crashed on his motorcycle," police spokesman Daniel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák said.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to arrive and transport the injured motorcyclist to the Pilsen hospital.
Subsequently, the police found that the motorcyclist did not have a driving license, the registration plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his serial number was polished and the production label itself was removed.
So it's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"A breath test performed on the spot ruled out the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test showed a positive result for the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How the Financial Rules of Football Will Affect Neymar’s Move to Paris
The rules limiting the funding of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the authority to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial conditions for Neymar's move to France.
As PSG is funded by a wealthy Qatari family who have made a fortune selling energy, they can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead of business activities related to football.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his appointment as UEFA director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that were indebted in the pursuit of new reinforcements would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP rules diverted its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with potential and spend lucrative sums on players y to build a global brand – was suddenly not as profitable.
Under the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may report losses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite Platini being forced out of office in 2015, his successor, Aleksander <0xC4><0x8C>eferin, is committed to advocating a ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP compliance, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-off payment, PSG can distribute the amount over the entire duration of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be signed at EUR 44,4 million per year for a period of five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi Group.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million ($82 million) – which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million – and ordered to reduce the Champions League squad to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is on the lookout for teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated with club owners.
Therefore, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funds provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymar’s income at PSG could be paid by the organizing committee of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and representatives of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar denied the fate that Neymat should become the ambassador of the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would be easily exposed by UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to insiders, UEFA has not opened any investigation into Neymar’s transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous, as he is not entitled to comment on the situation with PSG, according to the Associated Press.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million and a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar’s departure, arguing that PSG would violate FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' of the club and the state," la Liga president Javier Teba told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance on funding the club.
“It’s a consequence of ownership that has fundamentally changed the world of football in the last 15 years,” Wenger said.
“Once a club owner becomes a state, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club.
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> is coming to the set.
Same scene as in Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder started the game against Red Star, invented several goals, but his teammates did not aim for black.
The new multi-million-dollar reinforcements have put an end to the European Cup team after the opening doubles match.
Was it difficult to do anything with the match after the goal of Belgrade?
After collecting the goal, it was necessary to score four goals, which was difficult for us.
At least we didn’t want to lose, we wanted to raise our self-confidence so that we had something to bounce off into the next matches.
We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the game so long?
The game is terribly elaborate.
The combinations of the opponents were much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we fired a shot in the half.
Of course, that’s very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you need to push the opponent more often in such positions.
Is there a large number of changes in the layout?
Of course, this is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We only played three competitive matches and the line-up is still changing.
The goal is for the coach to find the perfect 11 to fit.
Is it encouraging for you that you have already played parts of two games in a row?
These are still just parts of the game.
I don’t know how I’m going to play or when I’m going to play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same as an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they left embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
There was an amazing visit again, just like with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show me something they'll come back for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember seeing them when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far, we’re fighting with ourselves, we’re playing, so that’s not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for tax cuts to a large extent.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman argued in the complaint that the judiciary had violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were said to be incomplete.
Constitutional judges, however, ruled the complaint unfounded, <0xC4><0x8C>TK found from the court’s database.
The Court of Appeal is not another court of appeal.
“It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess factual or legal misconduct allegedly committed by the ordinary courts if it does not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,” the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in extradition detention in Argentina, where he was according to the resolution at the time of the decision of the <0xC3><0x9A>S.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million occurred only for the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage, according to the expert, exceeded one billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the entire amount.
According to the prosecution, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in only hundreds of thousands.
World Service and some of the companies with which the company did business have a relationship with entrepreneur Radomir Vybíral, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison by the judiciary for VAT fraud in fuel shops.
His complaint was rejected by the Constitutional Court.
The series "Summer to Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters of the famous 80s; and for the dirty 90s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and of course for the modern era, specifically 2001 before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rud were bigger.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of enduring memories.
From the point of view of the franchise, however, it seems that someone is running out of breath.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well - not only because of the absurd humor (an example is the story of the creation of a talking can with vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors departed from the main funny point - middle-aged actors playing teenage horny kids - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults, does not push so much on the emotional plane, and satire is sometimes sporadic, including a parody of 90s thrillers like "Hand on the Cradle".
At one point, the character finds a pile of Apple Powerbook junk, roller skates, and “a lot of 1991 stuff.”
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The benevolent Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn’t moved past his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the insane plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is instigated by George H. W. Bush (very well cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise are many side stories.
Particularly funny is watching the eternally young Rudd with long hair alias the character of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once respected character Andy is now under the old pepper.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of random insanity, such as the return of the "Seven Up" series, until it achieves what I assume will be a logical unraveling: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the final scene the whole band goes to the premiere of "Years to Not Survive."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to another type of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of "Such Normal Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde: Without Regrets" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of the eastern and western wrestling scene clash.
The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tough Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, who were brought to the English language by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it is not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as cops watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series was voiced by many famous actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny.
“Comrade Detective” focuses too much on the clumsy propaganda drama – which includes the Reagan masked killer – and looks like it.
Six long episodes are too stretchy and comedic moments are not enough.
On a shorter stage, the propaganda satire in the “Comrade Detective” could work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose hall two fat people eat burgers stacked on a large pile.
The clear message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgies.
The inventive Romanian creators were not mistaken: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not see the lifting of the IAAF start ban.
The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) has confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian athletes due to a state-sponsored doping program.
The vote at the World Cup venue, which begins on Friday, was very clear as expected.
166 delegates voted in favour of extending the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the refusal is primarily the fact that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as the head of the IAAF Special Investigation Group Rune Andersen noted before the Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been interviewed, and there are still trainers with a tarnished reputation in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
“While progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done,” said IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015 and the Russian athletes lost, among other things, last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming World Cup, 19 Russians will participate, who have previously proven that they have been tested for a long time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
However, they will not be able to start the championship in national colors and, if they win, they will not play the Russian anthem.
Bank of England sets interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following sluggish economic growth and a weakening inflation that has stifled speculation of rapid growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “in the background” in the context of maintaining interest rates – despite squeezing family budgets.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six-to-two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote in favour of raising the interest rate supported weak economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the cuts in family budgets will continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank indicated that over the next few years there should be growth due to inflation caused by Brexit, and also said that rentals from real estate should grow in financial markets more than expected.
The committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was designed to boost the economy and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Term Finance Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, is due to come into force from next February, although the Bank of England said it will now offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion less than the planned <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term along with pressure on households’ real incomes and consumption burdens.”
On the subject of rates, the bank said it would be necessary to “tighten monetary policy belts” to pacify inflation, “to a higher degree” than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be “slow” and “limited”.
The bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next year from 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The projected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current state of affairs came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it should increase slightly by the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report is a slight consolation for households hit by rising inflation and miserable wage increases, the bank said the situation will worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a decline in income in the coming years, but wages are expected to "significantly" rise towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also expected to grow due to the strong interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which will compensate for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were lowered to 0.025% last August in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that the complete unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Before the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rate hike along with rising inflation, which was putting increasing pressure on households. Three policymakers demanded a 0.5% increase in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the bank said it expected such a change and that inflation was set to rise again over the next month.
The bank stated that the overshoot relative to the 2% target was “completely” due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition in the mortgage market will only rise once lenders start competing for contracts with a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who are ending existing contracts and re-mortgages - there are free options on offer, as well as low rates that are gaining popularity."
NHS Prescribes Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 Patients
From September, patients will have access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention based on the Supreme Court’s decision to fund the NHS drug.
The National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients over a three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to fund the probationary period after an appeals court upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year stating that the NHS had the funds to pay PrEP despite saying the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was accepted by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decisive moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Other clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission between at-risk patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been checked by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program comes to taxpayers at <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS of England signed a contract this week to distribute drugs after winning an international public procurement.
The trial period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully utilize the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention efforts.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years of efforts to halt one of the greatest challenges to human health.
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National AIDS Trust, said: “We are witnessing a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
If administered correctly and to patients at risk, PrEP will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We welcome this statement with pleasure.”
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The number one priority must be fast testing across the country; we must make it accessible to every patient.
We now have the PrEP trial drug available and are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.”
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and, together, to end the spread of HIV in society.”
High-Level Life: Mezzanine and Smart Design Turned This Small Apartment at Earls Court into a Spacious Home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on the Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne smart terrace - it is a vivid example of modern design that makes the most of available space.
“I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something at a reasonable price.
I bumped into this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I immediately fell in love with him, and the same day I nodded at him.”
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage spaces and a mezzanine to make use of the high ceiling.
“I longed for a high ceiling, big windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
For this purpose, she employed Erfan Azadi of the Duck & Shed design studio based in Notting Hill and used the nearly four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to fill two gaps - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but at the same time to bend the steel structure so that at the correct height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - and at the same time add to the drama.
The mezzanine overlooks the beautiful living room with old copper window frames in Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and a retro chandelier by Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the ability to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is counterweighted so that it can be pushed back very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to that, what you're selling is living space - or valuation of your property," Erfan said.
"A real broker basically calculates the price of the apartment on the basis of living space when entering the apartment."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while preserving high-quality materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
“Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home,” Erfan added.
“You won’t love the electricity in the walls.
Yes, they’re important, but they won’t win your heart.”
As it turned out, the quality design and increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work of art.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is dissolving.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is widening.
California has banned its citizens from traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and banned its citizens from traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, U.S. citizens can travel freely across all fifty states.
California has banned spending state money on the travel of its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT and considers any expression of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has enacted the Conscience Reserve Act, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients has no obligation to provide it to them, but has an obligation to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have enacted laws under which religious charities that receive children from their mothers for adoption at birth are not required to give them to same-sex couples for adoption.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has banned the funding of its citizens’ travel to eight states of the Union from its own resources.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to scientific symposia, for example, in Texas, reimbursed from their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, such as to Tennessee, with the financial support of their schools.
They must receive either federal grants to travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund travel of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee ran out of patience, and its parliament passed a law declaring that it, too, did not like California’s policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but still did not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's imposing them in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would order a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
Here are the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money is used for and what they are not allowed to do.
Secondly, what's wrong with a conscience reservation?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why not just beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him under penalty to sell even pork when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker faces anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
She also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policies in powers that are not federal, according to their own, i.e., according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever again show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don’t know of a situation in American history where states have deliberately done so for political reasons, except in one case.
Even in times of civil rights struggle for blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was in the 1950s, the political cause was slavery and the war of the North against the South was on its way.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the Blue Democratic and Red Republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally disconnected internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic has been fined.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year’s presidential election.
He was fined for inciting people to take part in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has staged two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he wants to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling on people to demonstrate through videos posted on YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
“Later we will take them off the salary of a judge,” the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian election commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant verdict to be politically motivated.
The court also imposed fines of 300,000 rubles and 25,000 rubles on two members of the Naval election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in every way possible in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry business.
The verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeals in May.
The verdict is thus final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
The Brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $500 million.
Now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, the two brothers are squabbling over one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides on the Toorak estate, only three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who brought a dispute over common property and commercial assets to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the bitter dispute is constantly debated before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
In this place, the Westco Jeans family founded the company, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the company for $85 million.
Other properties have been purchased for the money, and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company’s assets, while his father Colin, who is Paul’s “significant driving force and dominant personality” in the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court files state that Colin owns properties worth $316 million, while Paul manages properties worth $176 million.
For Paul, it was the division of property and funds that became problematic.
“Colin’s proposal sounded strongly in his favor in my eyes,” Paul wrote in a statement at the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers now also compete over who will control the existing business - from which Colin, according to his statement, cut off Paul.
Colin counters that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some properties.
In a previous statement, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian ancestry dictates to me that family is the most important thing,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails, and messages from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer, are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers on both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had been running dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and had bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money from the mortgage, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco, "in his final year of college, Paul was still a little boy, about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped that the transfer of assets to their sons would go well.
“Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group of companies. Colin said that Mark was compensated with $10 million when he left and Luke with $26 million.
As Paul pointed out, Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former board member of the AFL club, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin’s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin responded only via a text message, in which he said that given the fact that the dispute is being resolved in court, “I have nothing to add.”
“It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to go to court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin said in a court statement that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
“Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a successful solution.”
On Friday, all hope was lost.
"Our disputes will be resolved in court shortly," Colin wrote.
It's a bucket in the Czech Republic.
Teachers showering children.
Public transport drivers pack water and summer clothes.
In the kindergarten Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they go out only in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and the trees planted do not yet provide much shade.
There's no swimming pool, but the teachers are showering the kids in the nebula.
In the afternoon, children stay in classrooms where the blinds and curtains are pulled down.
They try to cool the air with an air purifier because they don’t have air conditioning.
This is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is both indoors and outdoors, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open traffic during this period," said kindergarten director Miloslava Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
There is a glass corridor in the nursery, where the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning after 6 o’clock, the windows close and we have blinds on the southern sides to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
There are better conditions in the forest kindergarten Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have trees on the land, so we're underneath them.
"We have a beautiful nut tree there, there's a table underneath it, and we do things there," said kindergarten director Barbora Kompanová.
Teachers try to walk with the children in the woods, where there is more cool.
Children wet hats and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a hand-held pressure nebulizer that's used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," Kompan said.
Jitka Vilimovská, the director of the kindergarten in Novoborská street in Prague’s Prosek district, also said that teachers try to keep children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3 p.m.
Every child should wear a headgear.
Teachers also remind children to drink.
They can choose, for example, low-sweetened tea or diluted juice, and in the garden they have a drink with water.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad and a snack always fresh fruit and vegetables, which sometimes even their parents bring them.
"For example, today one of the mothers here brought about ten kilos of watermelon for the children," added Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
Drivers receive water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of tram and bus drivers are air-conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta <0xC5><0x98>ehková.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high temperatures of the tramways have not caused any serious damage.
Minor damage occurred in the loop in Hostiva<0xC5><0x99>.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks available.
"Cooled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and carriages," said <0xC5><0x98>ehková.
In carriages and in some alternating places, employees have so-called sodobars, which produce refrigerated soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform to improve the comfort of drivers on their daily shifts," she added.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic destroyed 108 of them, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly employed the fight against fire.
"Fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with harvesting, prevail," said firefighters spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
Even the evening weather change did not bring relief to the firefighters, when the heat in many places was replaced by thunderstorms and heavy rainfall.
In connection with the storms, firefighters went to 236 interventions.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
However, firefighters also needed help in Stvolínky, Czechoslovakia, where 60 people were evacuated from the children's camp due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures also gave work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances went to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the car.
People should have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odourless gas that is released by imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and a feeling of fainting.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to cut the president's media diet
Many have tried it before him and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, it will be the first.
The new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of President Trump’s information – including reports on television news – in hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here's part of reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with the staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem Trump’s White House is going to fix: misinformation that gets into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees that he must personally approve all information – whether on paper or verbally – because the president can make a better decision based on the right information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but many of his predecessors have broken their teeth to check on Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates back decades — and now, sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by the honest reporting, it was appropriate to show him that he was being talked about in a positive light by many other media outlets that were easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets in check – at least according to six former campaign organizers – is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media praising him.”
All right. Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don’t – that Trump’s tweets would be more outrageous if they weren’t checked.
The tweets that Trump never tweeted will most likely never be heard.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least a few times, then their efforts did not go to waste.
But no one has been able to regularly prevent Trump from sparking controversial topics.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people regularly try to bolster their agenda by pushing Trump’s materials — which may or may not be reliable — to support their worldview.
In May, Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the tendency of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
Here is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Current and former Trump officials claim that the president is often very angry at negative media reports, especially reports of leaks, and seeks to find their origin.
The situation came about in late February when someone planted a copy of an article from GotNews.com – the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson – that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a “source of many leaks” from the White House.
Notwithstanding the fact that Johnson has been permanently expelled from Twitter for harassment; or that he has not substantiated his claim with any evidence; or that he has published false accusations in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter were “trying to implement a system to manage and document the information President Trump receives.”
Would it work?
Now, three months later, Kelly is trying to enforce the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness will not fade away, and his aides are still competing for power.
These unchanging factors will certainly aggravate Kelly's mission.
Tourists Negotiate a Trench and Return to the ‘Millionaire Quarter’
Several of the wealthiest homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again engaged in a quarrel with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities about the rights to regain the field for their mansions.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a flourishing street in the town of Solihull, nicknamed the "Millionaire Quarter".
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after they were expelled in May. They did not even fear the trench that was dug on the site under the orders of the authorities in order to prevent their incursion.
Tactical group found gaps in defense and penetrated into the field with caravans unprotected gap, which served as a way.
Angry residents of the neighborhood attacked the Solihull City Council, saying it was “unable to solve the problem.”
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘They took the place on Monday evening after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they have returned.
More arrived last night, and more are likely to arrive today.'
She added: “The Birmingham Governing Board knows how to deal with this problem, using court orders to protect parks.
I live in Streetsbrook, and I'm not going to pay any more taxes until the board of directors settles with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: ‘It’s ridiculous, we just watched the last tourists leaving and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more, and this time they have brought their horses with them.'
A spokesperson for the Solihull City Council said: “We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and are taking the necessary legal steps in cooperation with the local police to successfully resolve the issue.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is imperative that as many local residents as possible report any unsocial or illegal behavior to the police at 101.
This will give us an overall picture of what we're going to do in court.'

Italians strengthen in the fight against rescue ships NGOs with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent rescue ships of NGOs arriving on the Italian coast with migrants from the Mediterranean Sea from arriving unless the NGOs sign new rules regulating their operations.
“Unless the NGOs sign the new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship from the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which has been in operation for the first year, declined to comment on the allegations made by Italy’s Attorney General Ambrogio Cartosios.
“For us, saving lives is and will always be the number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only comment on any current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the situation."
Italian authorities have been tracking the Iuventa vessel, the Jugend Rettet, since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the ship, handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting was reported to have taken place only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to the prosecutor's file, the Italian media reported.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as the Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The organization said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable because they did not represent any "substantial change or impediment" to rescue operations.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the recipient of the Nobel Prize, has also rejected the new code of conduct.
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp decline in recent weeks in migrants landing in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel," he said.
He also unveiled plans for further talks this month with the mayors of Libya on an economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameless Masaro<0xC5><0xA1>ová: Silicone and cellulite climbed from her overalls!
Hot summer days are completely tempting to wear only the most necessary, which will cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1> does the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, the moderators, the singers and everyone who has to do with TV Prima, just swarmed, her body covered in a mini-overall.
And just a few regular movements and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
Overal cut her between the halves so many times that she had to adjust it all the time.
There was certainly no need for the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages inciting Conrad Roy's suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter is serving 15 months of a two-year prison sentence before serving five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father testified in court on Thursday: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left at large until the decision was made.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Wearing red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood in place as the verdict was pronounced, tears in her eyes, hands clasped, and eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She couldn’t take her own responsibility,” she said.
"She showed no remorse."
Carter’s lawyer said it was “unfortunate circumstances that I deeply regret.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity, or even mental disorder, has no significant impact on her conduct.”
The plaintiff read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “There is not a day that goes by that I do not grieve the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me – I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever.”
Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was “stalked” by the knowledge that she would never attend his brother’s wedding and would never be his children’s aunt.
“The loss of the person I’ve been seeing since I was born is a pain I’ll carry with me for life,” she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in force that would penalize a person assisting another person's suicide, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter’s text messages were published inciting suicide.
"I don't care if you hang yourself, jump out of a building, or get stabbed," said a text message Carter sent just two weeks before he died while Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote to him, “You have to do it, Conrad,” and “You just need to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy’s death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, said in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi will adapt up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes “there are more smart options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities – including Munich, which is BMW’s headquarters – considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as a withdrawal.
European automakers have promoted the use of diesel-powered atuomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon regulation.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, automakers are increasing the cost of installing equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines, making it difficult for cars to compete.
While German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of pampering powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an attempt to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars, which during testing reduced the amount of emissions emitted, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics at Audi’s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former Zaccheo manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is not subject to extradition, so he can face legal proceedings in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in a criminal investigation by German police into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission limits – widening the accusations Audi faces in the US.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could have a negative impact on Volkswagen: luxury carmakers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
A man and a girl were killed.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One witness told SIC Noticias that the plane was flying just above the people who were sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people were reportedly fleeing from the beach to the sea from danger.
Unfortunately, two people were unable to escape the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias said.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom escaped the crash alive and were taken by the police for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are motorways in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is unfinished, although it was started in 1978.
Even if it is unfinished, it is constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What's that? What's that?
Yes, the Hradec Králové highway D11.
The Children of the Earth movement has halted the construction of the next section for at least a few months.
We East Bohemians get the highway in pieces, like when we cut salami.
They'll cut the wheel, and then we'll see when and if we get another one.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to reduce driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless streams of trucks run directly through the towns of Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> or Náchod, which is not a reasonable way around.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a tap since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové and other sections to Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> were recently started to be built, you could hear the loud banging of the stoppers in East Bohemia.
I mean, no one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that it will not be built this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club for Sustainable Transport from Brno filed a decomposition.
The Children of the Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They challenged the decision on building permits in their entirety.
In the decomposition, they request a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all the institutions concerned.
For example, the Hradec Králové City Hall, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
For now, we are leaving D11 near the village with the eloquent name of Po<0xC5><0x99>eba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
So we get off, we just drive on the highway and suddenly we stand on a side road and we prefer to get into a convoy.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the country.
A terrifying, constantly blocked road to Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov, the D1 or D8 motorways.
Everyone has their funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth want?
What is the essence of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network virtually unfinished in the current system?

Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the region of southeastern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to the dry climate and harmful insects, causing horror on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “Lavender cultivation in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
It is also the fault of cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria, which thrive in dry climates."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil that is made from it is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
Of course, the amount of oil obtained from these lavender is less."
A possible solution may be more efficient water distribution and slowing down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
Riodoce's staff meets regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the unrest taking place in the Sinaloa area involving organised criminals, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, they meet mainly for their own safety.
They learn that it is important for them to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to give names for every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foresight.
To pick them out - drug traffickers, politicians, traffickers and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals tasked with covering up criminal acts.
The violence continues and the bodies pile up across the country; journalists are constantly growing among them: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there have been at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is the co-founder of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His loss is palpable, even though his presence is pervasive - a large picture of Valdez with the inscription "Justice" pointing to the middle finger hangs on the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, his face and his glasses on his nose.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, it has so far sued two suspects, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, making it very rare for journalist killers to be brought to justice.
The journalists from Riodoca insist on reporting on the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; even though they are devastated by grief and the said territory is very treacherous at the moment.
Without information about the killers and without a vision of justice, a security meeting is pointless, Ibarra says.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, we can’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then got into his car and hit him not far from the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors seem to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
However, in the case of Valdez, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzmán’s arrest last year and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions try to fill the void.
Every day, several people are killed on the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is full of jeweled two-story mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “armistice” means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite the fact, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoce, still resigns from not protecting his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war on the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
The reconciliation might have angered the sons; the suspected gang members had bought all the copies of the newspapers as soon as they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of other newspapers with the same story.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the struggle of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that this would never change.
In the periodical Noroeste, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his $50 shares and found Riodoce together with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Riodoce eventually gained a good reputation for brave and truthful reporting; the newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists liked to search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I feared for my life," he said as he received the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a “way of life,” Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
"You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play dumb.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What were you doing in the face of death... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?’”
Riodoce employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They were all relying on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions in them about their own assumptions - how to do their job best and stay alive?
“They don’t like it when you get involved with their wives, their kids, their clean shops, their secret landing pads.”
"These things were forbidden," Boyorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is wrong, take your hands off.
The problem, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, is that “smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then there’s that thing with Javier.”
The old rules, he said, no longer apply in Sinaloa – as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the Riodoca staff meeting room because a few days ago a spyware was discovered that governments were buying to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief from the forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-story building in the bourgeois district of Culiacan.
Journalists joke about whether these police officers are among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who are corrupt, according to the government.
It has been several months since the last time journalists traveled to mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda this week.
The first of these is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They also dealt with suspicious government spending in the governor’s hometown.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings at one of Culiacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the state's attorney's office.
Officially, no one has disclosed the identities of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were alert when they were about to write about what every city dweller knows: that that restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán's sons escaped the army's intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about it in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and went out the next morning to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a burnt body was found, and the authorities say that based on the DNA analysis, it's Adamea.
The activity of journalists is intensifying throughout the country, many of them organizing protests and drawing on the sidewalks and buildings of the "SOS press".
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is on a visit to Washington, D.C., where he seeks international support and justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murders for proclaiming the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger could jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are “overtaken” by organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists are dying not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 has accused police and public officials of more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my messages.”
Next to the decapitated head lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to shut down, such as the newspaper El Norte, which is based near the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of reporter Miroslava Breach.
Others still continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed drug cartels publicly with an article on the front page titled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their homes or even crossed borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly being pursued.
And journalists are being harassed and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their job, every day is a great risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It's Friday midnight and Riodoce employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest issue sent to the printer - sipping beer when the phone suddenly rings.
They learned that 19 people were killed in a shootout between gang members and police near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many of the messages left in this area by the members of the syndicate promised.
Journalists are reporting this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by and the title changes again.
The sound of police sirens indicates another shooting.
Boyorquez takes a quick look at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they are afraid, they don’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is the eloquent slogan for all of Sinaloa - all of Riodoca's employees follow in his footsteps.
"How could we think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when, on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her out to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however frightening.
Researchers have now uncovered the first findings of an astonishing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains — which experts have dubbed the ‘Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs’ — have been found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin and reported that the dinosaur had a “problematic past.”
An article in the journal Current Biology said it was “the best-preserved ever found armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The Dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described him as “really remarkable.”
According to National Geographic, the armored squirrel is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He stumbled upon what appeared to be an alien object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
‘Just close your eyes a little and you’ll believe he’s sleeping,’ said Caleb Brown, the head of the work and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
‘It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur species – the Mona Lisa dinosaurs.’
By studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivore — despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank — was likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system used by many of today’s animals.
Experts say that this allowed him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur Nodosauridae family first appeared in the newspaper in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They uncovered a method of camouflage commonly used by today’s animals in defense – the animal’s upper part was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers’ findings are surprising, as Borealopelta’s size far exceeds today’s animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred disguise over confrontation in survival.
Many modern animals with camouflage - for example, a deer, zebra, or beltfish - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
“The sale of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers that predators posed during the Cretaceous,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely reddish-brown.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more knowledge about its life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to track down its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried away into the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The area of Alberta had the same climate as Florida at the time, and the rivers and oceans stretched farther inland than they do today.
“This nodosaurus is really remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time it is preserved in three dimensions so that we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as at the time of the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just close your eyes a little and it looks like he's just sleeping.'
During the Cretaceous period, giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, roamed the Earth on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been the favorite prey of his equally terrifying ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt’s body was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the snout to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm spikes protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of what is now Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it up into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “finding a surviving individual can be compared to winning a lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the finding seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front foot with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her entire body.
A day after arriving in New York, a St. Louis native sat down on the bed in an Airbnb room and scrolled through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a high school student.
"Police have just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
<0x40>TheePharoah kept retweeting her wall posts.
A St. Louis rapper tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying limply in the street, from which no one had taken him even after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
Death was nothing new to her and her family.
She put down her phone to come back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim’s father, holding a sign in his hand that read “Ferguson police killed my unarmed son”!
She was watching the live news - one of the policemen stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another police officer, she said, held a gun in his hand, pointing at the crowd and shouting, “I’m going to kill you all...the animals.”
"That's not normal," Ferrell said to herself.
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and what we can call normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
"I was angry and I was crying."
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to leave for Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described by a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and resistance, of strength and tenacity, told from the perspective of people living in a community who go out into the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell initiated a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headdress - on a topic they had discussed many times before - "about the experience with blacks."
"Remember when I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"There was no way I wouldn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the culmination... of what has happened in the past.
She had to know and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we have to do to liberate ourselves.
Despite the fact that I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, she is in no way different from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I could protect her from this experience, I would only harm her.”
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop of the South Florissant Road was opposite the police department, which became the base of activists who were waiting for Darren Wilson's words about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for the others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped to deliver it to the Protestants.
A new type of activism was slowly emerging in Ferrell’s eyes.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9,” Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. association and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the ongoing events.
Ferrell asked, “Are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story that can be used?”
This type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an unanswered interview, “We’ve heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often overlooked, and that’s what we wanted to change.”
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-director Damon Davis, a renowned local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners in the cell of death.
Ferrell and six other locals, who were followed by the Whose Streets? team in the years following Brown's murder, were also involved in the project.
"No one speaks for us in this documentary, but it's our testimony," Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the purpose of the documentary was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about a savior leader, but about bringing the community closer together," Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most open to participating in filming.
“Whose Streets?” describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, smiling at the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"But I realized that in order to do this job and humanize blacks, I had to open up."
In addition, Ferrell’s story highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement — who created a social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the 2012 murder of teenager Trayvon Martin — call themselves weirdos.
“Black eccentric women in leadership positions ultimately stand for preserving the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the brunt of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of eccentric black women.”
She insists, however, that "this is not a mere affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of her views.
"She was the driving force and source of energy," she said.
“It’s no coincidence that she’s at the front lines, because life at these crossroads in the skin of a black weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television cameras have cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for blocking a highway during demonstrations.
She described the social-political atmosphere in the area, which she calls home, as "a mess."
Yet she does not cease in her efforts, to which she has been committed since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we have to lose is our chains.”
A field was on fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters arrived, including a helicopter.
Not far from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod in Cologne, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was on fire from 14:00.
The fire stopped at around 3:15 p.m., and firefighters issued a third-degree fire alarm out of four possible ones.
According to a spokesman for the firefighters, Ladislav Holom<0xC4><0x8D>ík, the helicopter also helped to extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00 firefighters managed to put out the fire, the fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical defect in the engine compartment of the harvester.
Hasit was also helped by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six drops of water.
"We have handed over the site of the intervention to the owner, until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. it will be guarded by a volunteer fire brigade," Holom<0xC4><0x8D>ík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are several faces of different skin tones - white, black and gray - hung from the ceiling on the wires, each of which seems to have fallen out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from smears from her mouth and hair, sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where she is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized disclosure of classified cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, is called A Becoming Ressemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her expertise in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before he left office.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning’s DNA and using 30 portraits to depict what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual commentary on the suppleness of DNA – as well as on the many ways DNA can be interpreted – and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, had been talking about herself as a woman since she was young, and was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six espionage laws violations, computer fraud, and theft.
All of her photographs were held by the prison staff, and only one black and white, lower-quality photograph leaked to the public, in which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in the platinum blonde wig she is now associated with.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to the 2012 project Stranger Visions by Dewey-Hagborg.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items – such as cigarette butts and chewing gum – to create a picture of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They were about to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add a portrait to the article,” Dewey-Hagborg said at the opening of the new exhibition.
Visits and photography were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over the course of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoila Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, a few days after the comic was published, President Obama asked for Manning’s release, a welcome change after several unbearable years in a Kansas military prison.
What’s really interesting is that the exhibition takes place at a time when Donald Trump is at war with people who seek to expose government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to incite resentment in areas he should support.
Dewey-Hagborg said in response to a question about this particular timing that “everything happens for a reason.”
Under the artist's statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls out with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is leaked with the heart) after the end of "self-sacrificing factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a centipede of the letters C, G and A recorded with a pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
“I hope that people will learn from this that our genome does not matter who we are and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way,” said Dewey-Hagborg.
“DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them.”
The last copy of the exhibition, placed in a separate room, is the only page from the above-mentioned graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging in the manner of King Kong from the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a megaphone in her hand.
“Once they stop you from speaking, they win,” it says.
"Never be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript of one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning had not yet personally visited the exhibition - as predicted in the comic book - but when she did, she would be welcomed in the center of the room with her masks, her own genome-like images, arranged like a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the almost 160 cm tall statue of Manning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded with a pencil.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel crowded," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and liberates it.”
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Murder
A Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff are being prosecuted for the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
A first-degree murder warrant was issued on Monday for a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the Cook County court file.
Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died of several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body was found on July 27.
Police were alerted by telephone and found the victim in one of the apartments with several lacerations upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments.
Cornell-Duranleau has been pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a murder, while police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university’s vice president of public relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem was now on administrative leave and was barred from entering the university’s school premises.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have been contacted by British police and are ready to assist the US police as well.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked by the reality and wished he would report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations at the Chicago Police Department, said he urged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have information on their whereabouts and efforts to track down the suspects are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were assisting police in searching for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren had been caught by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: “Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
“We will complete the WADA plan in the near future” – Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and re-establish the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"Some of the criteria for the new plan have now been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The vice-chairman commented on the second part of WADA's plan to comply with the code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the code contains nothing to worry about Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be made available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future.”
One of the criteria, however, calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, on the alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes by the government.
Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we can’t admit to something that never existed.”
Mutkov’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: “We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely unreservedly," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of carrying out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
The organization, however, authorized the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to WADA’s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “on the right track” to renew.
Police have charged three people, one of them a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with setting fire to a rare wooden church in T<0xC5><0x99>inec-Guty, Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dek-Místek, on Wednesday.
One of the defendants is a minor, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a crime of general concern.
Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el told reporters today.
According to him, it was a deliberate crime.
"This is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," said Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el.
He said police would discuss a possible detention of the accused.
Further information, according to the director, cannot be published.
"I can't say any more, because the criminal police and investigation service and the state prosecutor, who is overseeing the case, are really working on the matter," Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Guty dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, the material damage will be up to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Shortly after the fire, thought began to be made about the restoration of the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance, the additional costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by a fire fifteen years ago.
It was caused by a fault in the electrical wiring.
An exact copy was made in its place.
The state counts on the citizens to defend the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for associations useful in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers counts the factual intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state.
The Ministry of Defense, which was tasked with its processing by the government, promises that it will be able to increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
This is based on a proposal that the ministry has prepared.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support defense.
According to its authors, the basic goal of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the population of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the exercise of military duty and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists, and allow them to increase the abilities of their members.
In return, it would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the country for help in times of crisis, and their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in their training or education.
It also counts on organizing talks with war veterans or people who acted heroically.
One possible option is that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state should use their capabilities only after the declaration of a state of emergency.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual erasure of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the statement said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the intention is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond competently to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to hinder the performance of tasks by improper behavior of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the intention states.
The adoption of the law would entail considerable financial burdens.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to payroll or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, employing a total of 42 additional soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the gunmen who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons prohibited by the directive.
Startups to help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but couldn’t find a suitable survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And despite promising anonymity to the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the whole process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of the San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
He asked for help from outside.
New HR startups are constantly emerging on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intention of measuring employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographics, offer complete employee anonymity and a complaint hotline, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass supervisors and contact directors directly.
“There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she has gained more awareness of what her employees think and feel in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and an overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low ratings - allowing the user to work on the remedy.
Companies are beginning to realize the need to look out for the culture of the workplace – in case they become another Uber – that is sweeping through scandals after a former employee posted a blog post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the technical and financial progress website Let’s Talk Payments, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
The Denver, Colorado startup Convertent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber’s scandals.
Nearly 600 of Convertent’s clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has also taken under its wing.
Like Glint, Convertent allows companies to send customizable “flash” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
Where the Director-General is involved, complaints are sent directly to the Management Board.
“The Court of Public Opinion has regulators empowered,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is convicted of ill-treatment of its employees or unethical behavior — and if regulators do not intervene — it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, employee exhaustion, or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convertent for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of corporate policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace the phone number or e-mail to the management of the company, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s general representative, who said there had been no reliable way to track employee complaints before.
Now that the company uses Convercent, it ensures rapid detection and resolution of problems that previously never got to managers sitting in offices, miles away from real complaint resolution - for example, discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“It’s approaching a holistic, overall view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
“At the same time, we protect shareholders from employee litigation.”
Companies stopped taking ethics, values, and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron collapsed in a case of employee ethics abuse, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until “social media lit up the whole thing” that companies began to realize that in the online world they couldn’t just hide their skeletons in a closet.
“Before humans started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convertent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity endorsed by bold capital investors who have supported both startups.
As part of its February campaign, Convertent raised a total of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually withdrew a capital of $47 million.
Glint earned $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing number of surveys clearly confirm that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to feel that they are being accepted and appreciated and that they are dedicating their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convertent and Glint.
Investors make money if a company thrives, and companies thrive if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it is not surprising that there are many investors who will support this effort.
According to experts in work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company requests feedback from its employees, there can be big changes.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can provoke disappointment and disinterest of employees.
“Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies relying too much on data alone.
“Because as soon as you don’t get things done, employees start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, which now regularly surveys employees every month, can solve the problem within a day with Glint, Errett said.
After collecting feedback from employees who were frustrated with slow decision-making and quality communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday gains a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in a field known for frequent layoffs in the long term.
“If you don’t seek to create a transparent work environment, employees won’t believe you,” Vitrano added.
“And as soon as you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company will go bankrupt.”
Thursday was the warmest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice in Hodonín.
It was the warmest day of the year, with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, there were not many temperature records compared to Tuesday.
Heat hit mainly Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equalized at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, it recorded a record of only nine long-term measurement stations.
For example, in Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the B<0xC5><0x99>eclav region, today 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree, and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as in the case of Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, came from 2013.
Today, high temperatures have appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, the highest heat was in Dyjakovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí in B<0xC5><0x99>eclav, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the website of the Czech Chamber of Commerce and Industry, today’s highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures started to rise there only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and there may be more heavy rains on Sunday.
In most parts of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We've had a lot of trouble here.
It is not enough for billionaires to have the same vote in an election as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as rude as Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penta owner Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues Martin Burda and Antonín Fry<0xC4><0x8D>, sponsors Robej<0xC5><0xA1>ek Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupt and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta got the Party of Privates.
The political movement Agrofert, as the mayor of Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>, Jaroslav N<0xC4><0x9B>mec, named the project by Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, is a chapter in itself.
The billionaire was also recently captured by the Mayor.
It is Dalibor D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, the owner of the company for the security device Jablotron.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
But Grandpa's entry into the mayor's jersey didn't go very well.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement to win 20 percent in the elections.
Somebody smiled.
Grandfather’s resignation is more of a sign.
Billionaire Dalibor D<0xC4><0x9B>dek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for the votes of voters in the Mayor's uniform, he continues to support Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Grandfather Babi<0xC5><0xA1> supported him in the last parliamentary elections.
"Grandma is not a keen speaker and does not have the charming rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
But it’s not because you want to improve personally.
For me, Grandma is a hero.
He is willing to step out of his world, which he has in control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babi<0xC5><0xA1> again.
And he said that he wants the Mayors to learn how to imagine possible cooperation with Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Some may appreciate that Grandfather does not change his opinions and stands for his own no matter what kind of jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babi<0xC5><0xA1> sends to the Mayors to build their B-shaped someone so clumsy.
Others may ask whether the head of Jablotron and the head of Agrofert broke up badly in the store and is not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
Grandfather’s first public appearances, however, did not only revolve around Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been difficult for anyone to pause on such a statement.
After all, the court-recognized thug Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala wasted millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Vita Bárta, TOP 09, and the civil democrats came together to almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than $3 million to a political party.
When Grandfather entered politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe you shouldn’t ask yourself why politics has such a bad reputation.
In his first days in politics, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek was crowned with a proposal for a tax advantage for families with studied children.
People with higher education come to us about fifty thousand a month.
The ones with the basics on less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich for the conditions here.
The one with the 20-poor one.
In Grandfather’s vision of society, the poor pay taxes fairly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of a welfare state in which they do not participate much.
In short, the rich need to be helped so that they do not wreak havoc with poverty.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babi<0xC5><0xA1> rub his hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandfather, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there is the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who have neither members of their party nor citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want all people, not just some, to live well in a rich country.
No one wanted Trump’s paradise.
The villa complex had to be discounted by 234 million.
Selling property is sometimes not easy.
And often it does not help even 11 bedrooms, a magnificent view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
In the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible 8 million pounds.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The pamphlet says about the property, "Greetings, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the association of the real estate company with the US president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an astonishing <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
The original price of the property was <0xC2><0xA3>21.5 million, the final price fell to <0xC2><0xA3>13 million.
Even after a discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The breathtaking 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also has a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the land.
From the terrace there is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the usual property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about <0xC2><0xA3>15 million.
The property was to be purchased for lease purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new price, it comes in second place.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at <0xC2><0xA3>13.5m.
The NCAA has decided to end two training sessions a day. Long days are coming for the Bruins
It's 11:00 a.m. and UCLA football players are clutching at the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, an unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team members, these few minutes of doing nothing substitutes a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to their rooms after a three-hour training session to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting at 6:30 a.m. next morning.
"These guys are going to have a hard time for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's shift to Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That’s why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled at 7:15 p.m. – to cram into the already crowded schedules of many students.
For the first time in his six seasons as Westwood coach, the Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and trainings are limited during the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one per day also has an impact on this.
A total of 18 training sessions are scheduled until August 20, after which formal preparations begin for the first game against Texas A&M, which will take place in September.
Mora was heard to support the NCAA's decision, despite adding another item to the already-charged player's diary.
"For three or four days, the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one gave up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.”
UCLA will be closed after the training camp ends, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center hotel, which was occupied by players after harvesting the safety net behind the goal pole.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora admits that when the rooms are empty during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is possible that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking No. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe that everything will go well.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook Plans to Examine Facts More Thoroughly to Reduce the Number of Fake News
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties to check and display the findings below the original posts in an effort to combat so-called “fake news,” the social network said on Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year’s election of the President of the United States.
Political debates are taking place in Europe, with French voters flooded with fake news about the presidential election in May, and Germany planning to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September election if it does not swiftly remove angry posts.
Facebook said in a statement on Thursday it was planning to test a new fake news check feature in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party verified messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decisions about what they can share,” Sara Su, Facebook’s product news manager, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
Creating a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
Scotney Castle recently starred in the music video for Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher took refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scotney, however, witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from his cosy little town on the Bewl River in Kent, UK, which inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
“The sight of the writing of a man who is 300 years after his death fascinates me,” Rhodes says with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of the families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of documents inspired by the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was fascinated by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like going back in time.
I love the archives!”
For someone so fascinated by old papers, the support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and the possibility of staying almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on the wall and bottles that had been thrown in the trench for centuries.
He strolled through the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to the hawkers, gardeners and occasionally the artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night, he drank whiskey and wrote.
Scotney's confidential history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained access to the documents only in 2006 after the death of her last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, the workers were only beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described with words such as "aristocrats of many centuries throwing their hands with the words: 'Take it to the attic.'"
Journals, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing property: "You may think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a birch tree.
Stop it, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the 1381 English Rebellion.
"I found a record of a mutiny at a castle in 1380 called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area, and I thought the uprising was a good starting point.
Maybe they have something to do with each other after all.”
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was only discovered a few years later after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes’ favorite family are the Darrells: “I was intrigued by the male generation – men back then were always indebted and spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
Various generations of the Darrell family have dealt with this by marrying rich or old mistresses—I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to shake the heads of the heirs.”
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for further adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stand in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was engulfed by nature.
This is a strange place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
“I was like, ‘Now I’m going back to real life.’”
Washington is changing the terms of the Green Card.
The media published the words of President Donald Trump about the new immigration plan of the United States, under which there will also be a change in the granting of the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 annually as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
"The new application process will prioritize English-speaking applicants who have a wealth of funds and demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump said in a statement.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on our guard
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, there will be news on the Internet about the technological development of sex robots.
Yes, I am.
Sex robots are very popular nowadays.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots must be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
“People are making fun of them, but sales are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them more and more,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sexual aids are changing from inflatable ladies to robotic women with silicone leather, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, artificial intelligence, which mimics human behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
Very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own “personality” that would shame even the Stepford mistress.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone leather.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set various character traits, including shyness, to his surrogate wife.
And then there’s True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold sex robot woman, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including “Frigid Farrah” who is characterized by a shy nature and “Wild Wendy” with an “adventurous” nature.
“Roxxxy Gold is tailored to suit your personality to the fullest extent possible,” reads the True Companion website.
She likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or “in the mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for a number of reasons - among which there is no confusion with real interpersonal relationships. Rather, the inferior female character traits and violent allusions - e.g. frigid (read defiant) Farrah are worrying.
The company True Companion on its website likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t a man have a Roxxxy?”
But sex robots are not mere fetishes or sexual aids.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift away from ideal or gender equality towards the desire for captivating sex with an optional surcharge.
Of course, most men don’t buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the general public’s interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set by the modern times.
And most people are not weird or violent until the free market gives them an excuse to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights and the president is sitting in the White House, often speaking very derogatoryly about women.
The most terrifying aspect of The Maid's Tale is not what we see - hanged bodies and hollowed-out eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The Handmaid’s Tale book is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should resemble real women as much as possible (although with the standards of a porn actress).
Their creators design them to be pleasant to the touch and to look like a real woman at first glance.
But when it comes to their “personality,” the robot cannot replace the real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job, no history, nothing that would encourage their independence or undermine their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.
The 21st century: the maids.
NBA star on the green side.
Curry's fighting in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose his first shot at the premiere among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player winner has played the first round of 74 shots at the Ellie Mae Classic Lower Series Web.com Tour in Hayward, California, and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate among the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left behind a dozen professionals with a score of four shots above par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, having to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it got a little saddled," Curry said, saying he was terrified.
It was very nervous to blow the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I had hoped for.
“If you had told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would have taken it immediately,” he added.
If Curry manages to break through the cut, which is likely to be determined by two blows under the steam, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of my anxiety, I hope that it will be possible," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in the Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exemption and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's Great Victory?
In contrast, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political rift that divides American voters and, on a micro-scale, tears apart entire families.
During the period of Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers were full of advice on how to deal with relatives who elect Trump.
Apparently, we're just waiting for them to let our nerves go.
But less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to bring families closer together.
I’m talking about it because this week in New York I was visited by my cousin, a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has long been a Republican fool in our family.
She reminded me that being together in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden the whole family — including all the Republican siblings with whom she has been quarreling about politics for years — is on the same wavelength.
Dinner at the family table is a good thing; but what strikes me is that, in a broader context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the frightening possibility that his clownery may one day lose its appeal.
But there is an even more horrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what can be called rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which seem to be very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump’s departure, it will be enough for the next Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visit and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks Department -- you can't find a better use for your three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the center cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filming and staring at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy look, and the clinking music strangely resembles public transport.
Many clichés soon get tired: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama looks around, instead of breathing the atmosphere on you, and the reality of the city does not catch your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still don’t get over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn’t actually Swiss cheese – not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage theme pub – but the London Underground station.
However, the carousel in Central Park evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, will have a great time on it.
If I could rate the carousel, it would deserve a maximum of points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to rate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
It's the same thing in a coffee shop on the corner of my street, except I can put a 15% tip on something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is thus forced to intrude into the favor of shoppers when it is not necessary.
The woman in the store was smiling and apologizing to me when I reluctantly rated my credit card handouts five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to his wrist, which the prison said he caused himself after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing the original murder sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of a toilet cabinet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistaken her for a thief.
The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they said was too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces up to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive-bred panda has given birth to a baby that has mated in the wild.
The Panda Rescue program is a huge success.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas kept in captivity.
Zhang Zhong, an employee of the center, told the New China Agency that the breeding of pandas is at great risk from related crossings.
There were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
Only 2,000 of them survive in the wild.
Trying to pair the captured pandas with the wild ones is the first step towards helping to protect the species.
The 15-year-old Cao-cao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists were able to observe her every step.
Cao-cao met her chosen one 12 days later.
The intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males quite misjudge the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, she weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the arrest of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by Sithonian police in the morning of August 1.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and imposed severe fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Inspections will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open Major.
The pitch in the Kingsbarns of Scotland bypassed the score one punch under the par when she played three times a birdie and twice a bogey.
The twenty-two-year-old Czech player thus has the hope that she will pass the famous major for the first time.
Entering the competition with a grant of $ 3.25 million came out best American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the record field of 64 shots, that is, eight below par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch food safety authority NVWA said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it said meant 80 percent of the eggs on the market were harmless.
The Authority stressed that the risk is posed only by a limited number of egg types identifiable by specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also proceeded to close the farms, have not recently been imported into the Czech Republic.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, the markets of which have shown problematic signs of insecticide.
Eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May, according to the veterinary administration.
The last time chicken meat from Belgium appeared in the Czech Republic was in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is usually part of preparations against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers the preparation slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalkeeper Sedlá<0xC4><0x8D>ek and is looking for engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," smiled the 27-year-old Sedlá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who could start the season in the Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement before the start of the new year.
How were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like I did in school, it would be three.
The first year I didn’t catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year I started catching.
“Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I alternated again.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But in the first ten games, we only got maybe five points, so the coaches started to shoot it.
At the end of the day, my colleague was more interested.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
It's beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're in our third year together, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan who have to change their playing style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn’t see a problem with the width of the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play into the void.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Did you have trouble traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, that’s not a problem.
He can sleep peacefully.
The program is usually done in such a way that you play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians see their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, together with basketball it is the national sport.
Fans all.
Even if it didn’t go well, there were a lot of people.
Did Dinamo's presence in the KHL help Latvia almost reach the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results at the World Cup began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
It was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they have reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts took the lead and before signing the contract is Ralphs Freibergs.
Why do so many people come here?
They're not B-players, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It is a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still not engaged?
At the beginning of February, I knew that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for the goalkeeper, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked with different teams, but in the final they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That's what I was four years ago when I left here and I didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am at home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where I sign it.
How realistic is it to start a new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where it turns out.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to make an arrangement.
Do you prefer a competition?
The last season wasn’t enough for me to choose.
So I'm waiting for a call.
The government stunt at Flight continues.
In January of this year, in the article With the care of a good farmer? I wrote, among others, about the camp in Lety near Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to remind myself of the main passages of the article.
The camp in Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it is probably best to look, for example, on the official website of the cultural monument Pietní instead of Leta.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, they learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from August 8, 1940 it served as a labor camp, from January 1, 1942 it was a collection camp, and from August 2, 1942 it became a Gypsy camp.
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first Latvian prisoners were included in Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp by the largest transport.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings, caused by human beings and perverse ideology.
There is no doubt that it is necessary to constantly remember these events.
There is also no doubt that this commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering experienced by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built near and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy back and demolish the pigsty, but so far this has not happened.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pigs.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "there are some numbers, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them."
We’ll see what the expert report brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it will not be a cheap thing.
And yet, just a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a memorial, in which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction were beautifully funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is apparently not a threat, I think it would still be a waste of money.
Does the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place of worship, stands, by the will of history, practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wishes can bow here to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the feast place with the utmost care.
For the entrusted property, including the money of the taxpayers, the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should treat it with the care of a proper owner.
At least as much as in your own company.
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
But still, from the point of view of the above facts, I see the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May of this year, I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, modified parking lot, replicas of wooden camphouses.
In one exposure, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own place of worship, which is made of stones located in a slight slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as befits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway on the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider, for example, whether it would be possible to preserve part of the discovered foundations and make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could step up his efforts in this direction.
If he succeeds in enforcing the purchase of pigs for state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can alleviate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to consume meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
Study leader Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilt to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of mice with a specific bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a link between one species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support the body’s tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.”
At the same time, he suggested that if the same was true for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, as part of a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice bred separately lacked cells.
One group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
Intestins of mice were tested by DNA ordering method, and the researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells that were lacking in a second group of mice.
Mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked an intestinal microbiome -- so they didn't develop this kind of immune cell -- were injected with L. reuteri bacteria and developed immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured L. reuteri in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid — bacteria-free — to underdeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the byproducts of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably strive for the development of these cells, because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the cell population."
Jose Mourinho says signing Nemanja Mati<0xC4><0x87> and his move to Manchester United is ‘genius’
Manchester United got a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Mati<0xC4><0x87> - at least that's what Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Mati<0xC4><0x87>, who signed a <0xC2><0xA3>40m deal, made his first appearance in a 2-1 win in Dublin – the last pre-season match ahead of the UEFA Super Cup, where United will face Real Madrid on Tuesday – and impressed in his role as midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team’s pre-season Asian tour, Mati<0xC4><0x87> did not have the form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinho says needs to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
“It takes time, but he’s experienced, he’s intelligent, he’s brilliant, he’s football-minded,” Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Mati<0xC4><0x87>, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho is slowly starting to shape his eleven for the next season.
An independent source said this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" of bringing three of the four most important players to the team.
“Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players,” he added.
"Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I admit they did their best for me."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins of the Lady Pear.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This promising picture began to emerge thanks to a new program on TV Prima Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Academy.
Pear sniffed a chance.
"Dear Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on the social network.
And since the two of them have been peaking for several years, Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a did not forget to irritate him again this time.
"In return, I can teach you how to sweat from diet chicken, American cucumbers, or I can invite you to water and show you why fried cheese is a favorite," Pear said.
He is serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to step up and learn from the master.
"The question is, what does the boss say," Lightning said.
Pohlreich did not comment, however, because he was filming new episodes of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Prima only reacted to Pear’s participation in the culinary academy, saying that she considers the whole matter as her personal activity, which goes beyond television.
Pear struck a big blow to Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
Over 300,000 units were sold in a few days!
The new show that Prima presented yesterday at the press conference for the autumn broadcasting scheme is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve volumes.
In the last episode of his show Now the Boss is Cooking in November 2014, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k had a crossed-out pear ironed on the back of his shirt.
If he had my face in there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'll just smile at the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," replied Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a.
He thinks of Lá<0xC4><0x8F>o's culinary art.
"Cooking at home is not an option, because I'm not going to let the gastropunk go home," the boss says.
I respect Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Pohlreich very much, even according to him I make chicken for honey.
But his recipes will definitely not appear on my show," Pear did not forgive himself.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook to me, he's a TV clown.
"A gastronomic illiterate or a moron," Pohlreich said of Pear in a lecture.
"I'm not in my twenties to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them that much either," Pear said.
British inventor uses microchip in hand to unlock car and house
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the doors of the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, supervises the procedure of implantation and adherence to treatment procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
The Northam company also offers a microchip-compatible door lock and car replacement service. The price of one lock is <0xC2><0xA3>300.
The married father of one child has integrated technology into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House Props Cost Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
The decision by the White House to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry last month came at $24,000, according to Navy records published by the weekly TIME.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the highlight of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a parade of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several high-ranking White House officials watched a showcase of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was on display next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forklift from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the helicopter's presence less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the unit responsible for managing the helicopter - said in a statement.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy's deputy commander for aviation, the day before the event began.
The report suggested that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the occasion of the show, which is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. and remain on site until the entire site was completely cleared, which was scheduled between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
The e-mail also said that if there was a delay on departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for the return flight due to working time regulations.
The original crew remained on site that evening, along with the helicopter and a security unit.
From the records - obtained by TIME Weekly - it was not clear whether a second crew had been sent in the end.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government assets for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was in order," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you've been blocked," the deputy commander replied.
This "Made in America" show was designated by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political implications.
While attending the event, the president pushed for a health reform that passed through the Senate and spoke of trying to keep the government's decrees in check.
The use of aerial vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentational reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane rolled in the background at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is flooded with complaints about his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ show, which unveiled products from all 50 states that are made by Americans from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often practice landings in the Washington area and on South Lawn, and rehearse possible arrivals with the President of the United States at the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump was attending the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the crew's current training, the official said.
The helicopter unit flew on the same day as part of “non-presidential support missions” for another eleven hours.
The White House said no additional props were paid for with taxpayers’ money.
A Sikorsky spokesperson said the company was not in any way involved in the negotiations to put the helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights, and the exact costs associated with the parade are difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017 is $24,380 per flight hour for DoD expenses for the VH-3D.
The unit records the time 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below the stated amount.
"It is very misleading to state taxpayers' costs based on estimates for reimbursement of expenses," Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD expense reimbursements do not include personnel costs, but include fuel costs, maintenance and contract costs.
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the purpose of the parade.
“The idea of the show, which is taking place this week, is to introduce products made in the US,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defense of our state and that they are providing jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens are involved in.
This fact should be remembered.”
It is not clear whether Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his tour of South Lawn. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump approached a Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I own three."
A young woman was trapped in a swamp at Macha Lake, and the police roamed to her.
The girl went to the beach around 2 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, she was trapped in the swamps.
When she decided to use her cell phone to ask the police for help, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"Therefore, police officers soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols set off to the place she described, but finding the young woman was not at all easy.
"Some of the police had to walk through reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they could feel the solid ground under their feet again," Baláková said.
She was also missing in the same way.
The policemen were oriented according to the direction from which her cry for help was coming.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her to count down aloud," the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman at three quarters to five in the swamps in Born<0xC3><0xBD>.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
An ambulance took her to a hospital in Czechoslovakia.
Connecting Grandpa with Stan?
The desired bride becomes a merchandising girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web-based project zdrameslusny.cz, it is as if a billionaire is basically telling voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
He also argued that the politically disparate party of lesser-known mayors and independents, in fact, had no national agenda for the parliamentary elections.
Its candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandfather, no matter what political opinion he has.
Vít Bárta used to start like this, and it didn't turn out very well.
With his pursuit of decent people and personalities, who will eventually replace some mayors on the candidates, which Gazdík admitted, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek also cancels the popular argument of the head of the STAN that the greatest value of the movement is precisely politically tested and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians even according to polls.
They are now quietly replacing the hasty-gathered unknown personalities.
The total break with the People’s Party, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the People’s Party.
But if only a few people suspected of identity at the time, after the arrival of Grandfather, the mere identity game ended.
Not only did Gazdík long delineate against Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s ANO, but at the first joint press conference, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, who praises Babi<0xC5><0xA1> publicly, stated the following: “My goal is for the ANO movement, i.e. the Mayor’s movement, to win twenty percent in the upcoming elections.”
Let's hope you didn't mistake the movement.
Grandfather is a successful entrepreneur and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics in a similar way to Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but, unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
For some time now, Stan has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Grandfather's helper seems to make the desired bride even more of a saleswoman.
For a while STAN went with the TOP 09, then with the People's Party, and now for a change he is looking for decent people.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs were practicing helicopter overflights in Most
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and search dogs were practicing helicopter overflights at Lake Most today.
A police dog must not be afraid of flying, said the head of police cynologists of the <0xC3><0x9A>stí Region, Petr Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the Bridge, both adult trained dogs and those who are still undergoing training were trained.
In addition to the standard training to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for the missing figure, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work, so that there is no problem with the trip by helicopter.
"The helicopter gets up, the dog goes and searches immediately," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
A dog who is restless or unable to start working immediately after a helicopter trip is removed from training.
"Most of the time, they keep them in the garden," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the <0xC3><0x9A>stí Region.
German shepherds are predominant, but Belgian shepherds are also increasing.
The guide takes care of him from the puppy.
"He raises him himself, prepares him for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which may reveal possible health disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, he passes the first tests at 20 months.
"It takes about two-and-a-half to three years for a sharp hit," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The length of service in the police depends on the health status of the dog.
It usually lasts for eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dogs.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of Netflix’s hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when the murder of Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
Confirmation from the streaming service has already received the third and fourth season - the first one has already received the first trailer and an outline of other negative characters.
In season three, the DEA focuses on the world's richest drug cartel: the Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godfathers, they operate “as a Fortune 500 company,” with the only difference being that they escalate acts of violence and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of communications with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian drug enforcement.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
Afghan Democracy Relying on Women in Politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, take part, the UN envoy to Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women are taking part in the local elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate in them, as well as in all related processes related to the elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has issued several threats against the electoral process, which is shifting international fighting activities to the other side.
In this year’s elections, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government is transferring its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said that a strong role for women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
A unique brewery is brewing beer again.
For a good beer to the resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lob<0xC4><0x8D> near M<0xC5><0xA1>eno back to life a few years ago.
The brewery, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted to steam engine operation.
The years of flowering followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during the Second World War, production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state estate.
The work of destruction was accomplished by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled for building materials.
In 2007, however, a new hope shone in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery is the same as it was in the nineteenth century, when its golden age began.
Their work was awarded the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was officially renewed.
To taste great Lobec beer in the picturesque landscape of Koko<0xC5><0x99>ínsko, visit the pub in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use kokorín water springing in the protected landscape area, malt from the Lobec fields and <0xC5><0xBD>atec hops.
In the tavern you can taste the traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specialties.
And do not miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and half past two.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind on a global scale?
Such a unique structure was to be the fortress Stachelberg between Trutnov and <0xC5><0xBD>aclé<0xC5><0x99>, at the top of the field ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by a vast underground.
There was to be a headquarters, a barracks, ammunition warehouses, materials, a power plant, an engine room, and a hospital.
The construction was terminated by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken down.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Association, who in the early 1990s began to reconstruct the unique building, you can also look here.
The underground is already 75 percent accessible!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry log cabin with an exposition and underground, the complex also includes an armed light fortification facility, two expanded infantry log cabins, trenches and the Trutnov Fortified Educational Trail.
Snacks, cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been listed alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's port near Rome or the Assyrian palaces of Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building above a beautiful garden.
The list, which he got, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of disappearing.
Enthusiasts, however, do not want to give up and organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next edition of Dinner for the Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery this Saturday, August 5, where Vladimir Mi<0xC5><0xA1>ík, Ivan Hlas, will perform, you will see swordsman performances and look at the places of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
You will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with the creation of herbariums and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application Pl<0x40>ntNet.
If they are interested in what plant they just stumbled upon on a walk, this application will advise them.
All they have to do is take a photo of the plant and the application itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was introduced on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Center for Ethical and Environmental Education in the Bratislava Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
Pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also took part in the project, photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application database with their teachers.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was for as many people as possible to contribute to the application with their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Already children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest," said Ivana Polá<0xC4><0x8D>ková, coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of a plant, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which is then assigned in both Czech and Slovak under the photo.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome that users, after creating an account, contribute a snapshot of a plant that does not yet appear in the database to the application.
"The French will assess whether it is beneficial, and then add it to the database," Polá<0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
GMB's concerns over investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
Trade unions are demanding assurances from McVitie's cookie makers about a long-term commitment to production at a factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent on a possible investment in a factory in the Tollcross area.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
McVitie’s owner, Pladis, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that workers and trade union representatives would be “among the first informed” in the event of changes in the plant’s operation.
In a letter to the company’s construction manager, the Scottish GMB unions expressed their concern that McVitie’s “will not receive its promises to finance and modernize production lines.”
GMB Chief Organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received a clear response from the builder regarding the company’s needs and future investment plan for Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and most of the workers come from the local community and the Glasgow area, where work at the factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of work, wages and benefits – and despite the outlook for Brexit, rising living costs and declining slow production – the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie’s.”
A Pladis spokeswoman said: “The Tollcross builder received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago, and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to our employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and streamlining operations.
We value the heritage of Tollcross and the locality very much, and any changes to the operation of the factory will be immediately notified to employees and trade union representatives.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t allow Neymar to take their side after making <0xC2><0xA3>189m, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but the French team warned Barcelona of its record raid three years ago?
Ligue 1 is set to double the previous record amount for Paul Pogba's transfer to Manchester United, which he paid <0xC2><0xA3>89 million for last season.
Upon confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world – after tax, he will receive over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week from PSG.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar got out of his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to comply with Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned any club interested in taking over one of PSG's top players.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will definitely reach out to one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to win over one of our players, they will face the consequences.”
It seems that Barcelona has crossed the imaginary line when it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that under no circumstances will they allow the departure of the Italian national team, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly comprehensible rules?
Donald Trump has nodded to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump had written that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it would not go on like that.
The idea of sanctions as straw from the boots is also sniffed out from this.
These things can't be thrown in one bag.
Indeed, Maduro’s Venezuela has embarked on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not acting the way the US president would like it to.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if one wanted to summarize it all in such a way that even the ordinary voter, whether American, European or otherwise, would understand what it is and what system of rules the sanctions policy is based on, this would be a task almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only catching up on what President Obama has already planned, he just stamped it.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the US election, it would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
Terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not relaxed, but tightened.
Europe is even more afraid.
Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Is Kosher just sanctions approved by the U.N. Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission chief Juncker says Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
Should sanctions be applied so that they do not endanger anyone?
Ordinary voters suck.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk agreements on the ceasefire in Ukraine.
It is now clear that this is an issue of EU energy security.
The electorate is growing and expanding.
Sanctions are being imposed on Russia for putting too much of itself where it shouldn’t be.
China is being criticized for doing too little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country’s borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, an order, or a rule?
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I am not thinking about cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is married, crosses the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, it has already completed all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not significantly interfere with them.
He even agreed that the Moravian-Silesian region should be led by the governor and shadow minister of education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member of parliament or a governor," Babi<0xC5><0xA1> confirmed his earlier position.
You have upset a lot of deputies and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the president directly, and I believe that we should elect mayors and mayors anyway.
In my book, I'm not talking about canceling deputies, they could be there.
The question is how many will be.
During the presentation of your book What I Dream About, when I happen to be asleep, I heard with my own ears that you spoke about the abolition of the councils.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct election and the reduction of the number of representatives.
New York City, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 deputies.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 deputies.
And the mayor is blamed for not building enough and not preparing big projects, but she does not have the competence to do so.
The same is true of a government that has been ruled by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
I’m not saying they did it well.
The current prime minister is not managing anything, he is only moderating the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to make it happen.
All we have on the agenda is a change to a one-way election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the House Rules of Procedure to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of Members who are supposed to work mainly in committees and committees, rather than performing at House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
This is exactly what your opponents are worried about.
As a dictator, you will run the government, control the 101-member House, abolish the counties and the Senate, and, through grateful mayors and mayors, rule the entire country.
I'm sure that's not the case.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron announced the reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 Frenchmen for one legislator, while in our country it is up to 17,000 Czechs.
No one is accusing Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic wins the election by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
However, the seductions for those who have a parliamentary majority are large, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing as a yes movement.
We just need a team in government that works for the people, not for their parties or departments.
I do not understand, for example, why we could not agree to increase only the salaries of teachers, workers in culture and social services.
Why did they out-vote me and add 21 percent to the GIBS, who are already taking 60,000?
Would you do that as prime minister?
The prime minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency, and for the money of the state they would like to do business like Marian Jure<0xC4><0x8D>ka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in government, they are supposed to settle their differences outside it.
There is no room for coalition rifts, power voting and business, it is there that decisions are to be made.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers are mostly partisan?
Above the parties is the constitutional law.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply, and he expelled Babi<0xC5><0xA1> from the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
However, if he is a personality and has management skills, such a futile gesture is not necessary.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would recommend as Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because we probably won't be in that government, nobody wants to cooperate with us, even if I don't know what I've done so bad.
There is no place for so much skepticism.
The mayors have got the entrepreneur D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, who would like to cooperate with you, and the people may win the wing of your favored Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC4><0x8C>unek.
No, I don't think so.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD is headed by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, and Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose it, may join the ODS.
I would leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomio Okamura, for example, in the area of economics.
So the Okamurovs come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his own political history, he ran as a puppet of Víta Bárta for VV, then he raised money from Dawn for his company, there was some kind of coup.
He is, of course, a distinct personality.
Slightly brown, of course.
If I take his program, he has a wide involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, you can agree with that.
That's not what I'm asking.
I wonder if a person with xenophobic views speaks at gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU is acceptable to you?
We are not thinking of cooperating with Mr Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in a row, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government agenda.
Let’s go back to your attempt to manage the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, never decided.
Coalition issues like CHEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was why he fired me.
Once he did, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ took over the Czech government.
After all, it is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which instructs the Minister of Finance how to vote at the general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
If you became prime minister, would you change the staffing situation in the Supervisory Board and replace the top management of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ?
Jesus, if I'm prime minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
There are rumours that CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for even better cooperation with YES.
After the election, everything will go on.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any lobbyist for Pokorny or R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ek, I'm a separate unit and I don't deal with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of government, will you seek to replace the leadership of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, that is, the institution that you criticize?
I want it to be a transparent society.
So far, for years, he has done what he wanted, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
Just look at Mr. Schwarzenberg's comments.
Although the state has a CEZ majority, he never drove it, he was there only in number, which is wrong.
For me, this is a trivial matter.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ is supposed to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supplier competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear unit.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don’t and won’t have any competence to fire anyone.
But to control, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public service radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of <0xC4><0x8C>T and <0xC4><0x8C>Ro.
Look at the way the reports are being discussed, the superpower pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from the investigation files and to the lex Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he got pushed by Kalousek to throw me out of the government, which added the percentage of TOP 09, but the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD took them off.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, and so they talk about the threat to democracy by Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
No one is immune.
What do you think of the articles describing how the first vice-president of ANO, Jaroslav Faltynek, builds his power by putting his son on the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with Kv<0xC4><0x9B>toslav Hlín, a related lawyer, with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy?
We have an ongoing dispute over this.
I don't like it, and I've blamed him several times.
Faltynek argues that the lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvílová, B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
If there was any hint of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like that happens, we'll get rid of whoever it is, no matter who it is.
