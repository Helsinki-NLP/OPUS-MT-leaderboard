<0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the confectionery
The new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD city councilors will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the House of Representatives.
The daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz "tested" the members of the new council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, as they know the notoriously established slang, which was created at the city hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which was introduced by the Prague politician during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councillor did not understand the familiar concepts.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> responded to the test of the "godfather" vocabulary of the councillor for culture.
Although he is a political veteran, Councilman Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted similarly.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you give me that I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I generally do not recognize slang."
From the vocabulary, which was published by the daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists had to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to a pastry shop", "bull neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "appropriate".
Three councillors agreed with the quiz, while the fourth – Antonín Weinert, who is supposed to be the head of Prague’s education in the future – first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
The fifth councilor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test.
"I don't deal with these things at all, and I won't judge how the civic democrats are having fun."
"I'm trying to figure out how we're going to deal with each other in our programs," he said.
As has already been said, Councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> would not have recognized in the headline above that we are talking about an influential entrepreneur and friend of the expressor Béma Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Voldemort" Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> does not tell him anything and the only term he correctly estimated in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"That's Blanka's tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, and immediately adds, "but I know it more from the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole is then deciphered as the Blanka tunnel not only by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>, the councilor for the environment.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukasz Shym is also familiar with where to find this figure - he knows the meaning of the phrase "go to the pastry shop" .
"I think that means going to a Prague company," Shy is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he recalls that he drew knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a vocabulary.
In social democracy, according to the participants of the test, there is no similar vocabulary of slang expressions.
"I've consulted with colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We call each other names, sometimes we use abbreviations and misnomers of names," says Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in Prague, who is nicknamed Hulda.
"I was called Birch at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me Birch," admits Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The name has been tried and it works.
The councillor Weinert is for the Deda or less friendly Dedek, the deputy Miroslav Poche, who pointed out fraud in sponsoring the party before the elections, has the nickname "Igra<0xC4><0x8D>ek" among some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing social democrats admit in their internal party discourse.
Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> says that he does not like to hear Hulda, but the daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz noted another nickname of this Prague president.
The "Doctor of Barrel Law" recalls that Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his degree of JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", published a brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common features.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they cannot get involved in work for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
The one who "becomes" a witch is sent to isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
"Man seldom has this fate."
“Young, healthy women don’t give up, either, because they help at work and give birth to children,” describes a nun in the West African state capital of Burkina Faso who takes care of more than a hundred women who have been expelled by their community in a special home.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She has published an information brochure to help curb the witch hunt.
But there's a catch.
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” Die Standard said in a statement.
Witchcraft accusations are common in other African countries.
In Burkina Faso’s neighbouring country of Ghana, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week after being tortured, spilled petroleum and set on fire by three women and two men.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was ignited with oil, which is used for ritual anointing.
He said the group was trying to "expel the evil spirit from the woman."
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education attained.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “The devouring of human souls has always been a danger.”
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to ease the witch-hunt, in Gambia the president himself participated in it last year.
"Gambian President Jammy has launched a massive witch hunt after his aunt's death, allegedly to take part in her death and attempt to use black magic to kill the president himself."
"He has called on shamans from nearby Guinea to help him, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's personal security, have forcibly taken randomly selected men and women from Gambia's villages to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, the imprisoned people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
The two imprisoned did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Bakal's tenant drowns in stoves, higher rent signed
An elderly man stepped out of the door of the client center of the company RPG Byty "uglobaron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file with new lease agreements for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son, who is in custody.
For all three, deregulation just raised the rent.
Instead of 3,500 a month, the son will pay CZK 4,100 for an apartment 2+1 of the second category from next year.
"And there is no hot water there, and it must be melted by petrama," the man points with his finger in his son's new contract, whose signature he has the power to sign.
"But I signed," he explains, half angry and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7 for the publication of instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man is just waving his hand.
"One says this, the other says that," he grinned.
Ostrava is becoming a major deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic are waiting.
This is why we decided to visit the “laboratory” in person.
Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov RPG waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and on Tuesday at nine in the morning it is already full.
Right next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and a summoning device.
"Rental 2011", a special button on his touch screen lights up.
One tap and the number paper comes out of the machine.
You won't even have time to read "157" and your number is already beeping on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're up in half a second.
After a while, an elderly couple comes to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room obviously does not concern new rents at all.
Most people have come to solve common problems as usual - repair requests, insurance claims, and the like.
Letters with new lease agreements in Ostrava are received in mailboxes by tenants of most of the 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments since mid-November.
RPG Apartments in letters proposes to increase the rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new leases was opened at the client center on November 18.
"It's been going on for over a week, so it's just in the works," the employees behind the counter reply after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal’s former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, he was quite loudly grabbed by the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament and the native of Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change my toilet seat," the man relieves himself.
Most of all, according to the workers, pensioners come to see if they will get a discount on the rent, if they sign in time, as promised by the RPG in a special offer.
Half of the discount on February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign a new contract by December 15.
Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov's "deregulation" desk is certainly not overwhelmed with questions.
"Out of yesterday's 360 clients, there were only about forty to fifty people here for rent for 2011," the workers behind the counter estimate.
RPG suggests individual contract negotiation on the web and on its boards where it is needed.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
“This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal process,” the RPG wrote on its website.
"No one's going to sue here," one of the RPG Byty's employees thinks, and the man on the street outside the client center gives her part of the truth.
“I have 13,000 pensions and I have 5,000 left for food, I don’t have enough to sue,” he said.
But the workers will soon be unsure.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent still does not even reach the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing stock," Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, reminds that the negligence of the housing stock blamed by the angry tenant is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to the homeowners.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs from rentals could invest four billion in apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov waiting room so far repeats several red highlighted information.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less affects 31,200 apartments, that's more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at most about 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio will receive a 38% increase in rent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," the RPG notes.
The rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive out rents in leaps and bounds, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another obligation: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) will give the company back to the apartments, mainly to heat savings - new windows and insulation.
Priority should be given to the people who sign the agreement on the increase of rents.
The offices also include a kindergarten, the architects understood
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect that it also hides a mini-schooler with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it has been open to children of Arch.Design employees.
The architectural design company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings arose, has been counting on space for its corporate mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs nearly 90 people, mostly of babyboom age, and cares about getting women designers and architects back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of part-time work, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of a social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine demanding work with child care.
The mini-school was invented by Arch.Design employees themselves and with the support of the management they managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (a subsidy of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and provide qualified personnel and operations for two years.
After the financial subsidy (2 years) is exhausted, Arch.Design is obliged to operate the mini-school for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project took one year and the application for a subsidy was greatly assisted by the company Economy Rating.
Care is provided by qualified staff, the children are taken care of all day by a nurse and a primary school teacher, so children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are over 3 years old.
Since it is a "mini-school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but during the day there are more children.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-school is comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and stressful situations with delayed pick-up of children from kindergartens far from the parents' workplace are eliminated.
Parents are more productive in their working hours.
It is not surprising that a naturally loyal employee-employer relationship is created here.
Arch.Design has thus become one of the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program have strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look into Gaudí's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its organic shapes, the house was nicknamed the House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of Antoni Gaudí’s Art Nouveau.
The front of the house is filled with dreamy lines, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
Detailed observation shows geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the houses sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the gloss of colors is further enhanced.
Curls and twists of shapes appear equally in interiors.
Wood in waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, eyelets and rails.
Located in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Gràcia 43, the Batlló House was rebuilt in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the apartment house Casa Batlló himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated with him.
It was on his design board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property were created, as well as the use of mosaics on the facade.
A number of other artists and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the designs of the Casa Batlló house started the successful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá and Güell Park, which contains Gaudí's other works.
From the locals, the house soon after completion, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the nickname "House of Bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening windows, began to call it a "living house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for his time, with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five degree slope.
When creating Gaudí absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he received a building permit from the city, but the information about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, during the completion, the city council was appalled by the result and asked for correction.
The councillors were concerned, for example, that the building interfered with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
Corrections never took place, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the appeal of the city district, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
The gallery on the second floor was a lounge and on the third floor was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The whole six-storey house intersects the staircase, which can be climbed to the roof terrace.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon door, and the larger company can communicate comfortably with each other without preserving the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí’s reconstruction also received an unconventional roof and two additional floors.
Also impressive is Gaudí's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which is lined with the inner courtyard, and skylights.
The game of two colors adds a maximum of light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and luxurious apartment is open to the public.
The owners decided on this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed at the tours because they found it to be a very profitable business, and in addition, they extended the tours to common and attic areas, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is certainly not negligible, it is 16,50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to quickly make friends with one of the residents of the apartment and visit it right at home.
How to choose a mattress and grate: women have different requirements than men
Not the sumptuous frame of the bed, but the quality of the lying surface, that is, the mattress and the grate, give the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit a specific user.
When choosing, a lot of things decide, from weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattresses and grates are made.
Typical example?
For example, latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend cottages, where they do not regularly heat up, because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
However, it is necessary to turn them regularly.
If they do not have a lot of venting ducts in the core, and still lie on a solid plate, they retain moisture: even mold could appear under them.
The habit also determines the choice.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel good on low and with a hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players coming back from the NHL complained to me that they weren't going to sleep here."
"They needed a mattress with a softening layer of lazy foam for their battered shoulders, heels, and hips."
"Such people are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they do not receive 'information' from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Therefore, many hockey players, as well as other customers, have been looking for a mattress with lazy foam for years.
"Today it's cool, a suitable mattress has, for example, Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing is pushing you, you will not roll over at night like after a hard fight.
You'll just get a better night's sleep.
Lazy foam also acts as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is usually about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, such as singles, it is recommended to have at least 120 to 140 cm.
For convenience and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, guildmaster of the Guild of upholsterers and decorators, who has been dealing with the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years and lectures it at professional schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own grid and mattress, but here, be careful when buying to match the heights of the mattress.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left but to mount the grilles to different heights, but this may not be possible for every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on a molding and boiling layer.
"When touching your hands or sitting on a mattress, you must definitely not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grating.
Full-furnished beds, where the mattresses and the base are like fused Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, you can not wash their cover, which is already common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will begin to resemble one large (and clogged) sieve.
That’s why experts reject advertising slogans about mattress lifespans of up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its buts.
That’s why the practical advice from the sellers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, do not give up hygiene and washable coating, but add a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers with zippers are commonly produced around the perimeter today, so after unlocking we get two parts (for washing and size of the washing machine very important!), still handling in larger types (and in one person) during shooting could resemble a duel of lightweight in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a solid board in bed instead of a grill?
Never! Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for one-night visits.
However, still provide the board (if it does not already have one) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (of it.Taschenfederkern) and a boiling layer.
A polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-positioning slatted grates with 14 to 18 slats, but you always pay for grates with more slats, 28 or more, where the slats in the hip area are doubled and their rigidity can be regulated.
The spring-skeleton mattresses do not belong to the positioning lamellar grates because they do not react to the positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the slats, the so-called shoulder cradle can also be indulged.
It is a special lamella fastening that allows you to push or even tilt the lamella so that the sleeping arm is nicely "hollowed".
For men who have "shoulders over the whole back" is definitely an important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers already remember it, who in the "men's" began to use a softening zone just in the area of the shoulders.
Women are also remembered - they in turn indulge in a softer surface in the places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed winged or plate gratings with so-called multi-torsion springing.
The pressure breaks down into more points and the tension decreases.
However, be careful, once you use the wrong mattress and grid cushion (large and "puffy"), most of the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and only touch the shoulders with the tips so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which is preferred, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (along with the shoulder cradle of the grate or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original grass-filled straw mattresses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is also in mattresses.
The raw materials from petroleum, from which polyurethane foams are made, are replaced by natural oils, for example, from jumper and soybeans.
All known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules to release the fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There is also a division between men and women.
While men are “cooled” by a plant extract from birch so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women, on the other hand, “heat” the covers.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making the weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
A mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with broken cellular structure, it is thus more breathable than conventional polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foam and "lazy" foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels should be.
For a quality mattress you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who meet health parameters, have a lower VAT rate, are taken as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on mattress and grate is not easy.
Sometimes you can use the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with sewn Memory foam into the cover for CZK 11,990.
The second one can be purchased for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and high density was started by Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because the astronauts were subjected to enormous overload during the launches.
Tempur softens in the heat, on the contrary, it hardens in the cold.
Thus, it perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the appearance of bedsores, but also to increase sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only on mattresses, but also on medical products, such as special pillows under the legs, which relieve the legs and the venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents want to watch their children.
Fear for your own child is driving more and more people to the idea of babysitting via GPS.
The system originally created for searching for cars can also track the movement of people, and thus help in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A number of people were terrified by the case of missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to search for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood that a tragedy will happen," said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases such devices may be misused, for example, if they are put in a bag by someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Most of the time, customers actually buy it for safety reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in case of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková points out that if a child does not want to wear anything like this, he will simply get rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity in how to intentionally lose some things when they don’t want to be in control.”
"Mobile phones were previously high expectations for parents, but they can be turned off in the same way as these tracking devices," says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
According to her, it is also questionable whether such a facility would actually help in the event of an attack.
"When it comes to a planned abduction, the perpetrator will almost always ensure that the child does not have any electronics with him that could reveal his location."
"Now it's a phone."
"As tracking devices begin to expand, they will look for them as well, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In this case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he admits that such a device can help in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after the attack, its presence can help.
"The device can be set to send the location regularly after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned shall be available."
"More expensive devices also have built-in inclinometers, so even if a person just slipped and remained motionless, the device will immediately send a warning indicating the location," says Czech.
According to him, a similar service can be carried out by smartphones with navigation, where it is enough to upload even special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either devices similar to pendants the size of a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, a device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
"This will have the greatest advantage in the fact that a potential aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll recognize them after a while, and that could give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether tracking devices evolve into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology used to watch cars.
This is a combination of GPS positioning (used by conventional car navigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the car.
The army has the incendiary cords to wrap around the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometers of ropes used to detonate explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of cords to the warehouses.
The military has a supply of 225 years.
The problem is that the shelf life of the cords is two, a maximum of four years.
The army bought the incendiary cords from the STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in order to justify the purchase of such a huge amount of MF DNES incendiary cords, wrote that soldiers use 60 kilometers of lighters per year during training.
However, from the calculations of the army’s pyrotechnics, which MF DNES addressed, it follows that then all generals, army commanders, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Minister of Defence Alexander Vondra and the commander of the army Vlastimil Pick.
This is the only way to justify the annual consumption of an army of sixty kilometers of lighters.
That's the equivalent of 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army’s supplies would last for more than a decade.
If, on the contrary, it were true that for the basic training of each new professional, a maximum of two meters of incendiary cord is enough, as experts say, then the army has secured supplies for the aforementioned 225 years with fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of genii or special forces.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade have recently personally complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition in handguns, so the shootings are also limited because of the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't mind that they buy so many lighters from us over and over again."
"But it's their decision, and they know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we are trying to satisfy as traders," says the sales manager of STV Group, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejszek said the hundreds of kilometers of ammunition would be available to the military for at least a decade.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> from STV Group, however, talks only about the four-year life of the lighter and the police or army pyrotechnics even about only two years.
"With perfect storage, it could be the four of them," says one of them, who, as a soldier, refuses to disclose his name because of criticism of the military.
After the expiration of the service life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another argument of the ministry is a quantitative discount on 445 kilometers of incendiary cords.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," said a spokesman for the Defense Ministry's buyers.
For comparison, the annual consumption of the firing lines of police bombers who dispose of ammunition from World War II or the Soviet army has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order just enough to use this ammunition before the end of its life.
It has proven itself for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can more flexibly obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence is already having considerable difficulties in disposing of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing to march on the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the pyrotechnicians, who MF DNES addressed, faces the same problem in a few years: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old lighters, which "cheap" buys today.
To this day, I draw on the contacts I gained through the competition
The winner of the Entrepreneur of the Year competition helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur from Liberec, became the winner of the last year of the Tradesman of the Year competition.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad he realized that in Liberec there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and using a bank loan, he bought a half-demolished house with five apartments.
It was a lot of courage to be a third-year college student at the time.
"The then ratio between the quality and the price of accommodation in our country did not allow me not to try to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into the house, which he gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, over seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year there was another one of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisá, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise are applying," says last year's number one entrepreneur.
"And in this sale of the license to operate the hotel to a large extent participated in the victory in the competition Entrepreneur of the Year," adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say it was pleasant," she recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended to everyone who is trying something.
It is not necessary to win, any visibility is good.
He says that to this day he draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not otherwise have gotten.
"Some of the people I met through the competition, I started doing business with on a regular basis."
The fame associated with success, according to him, also affected a little every employee.
He has about 70 of them.
“I see a greater loyalty and pride in them for being involved in something that has gained universal recognition.”
“It’s not just my personal success, it’s the result of the good work of all of us together.”
"Only my name is put in the forefront," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the determination of the winner, Farmet has worse times behind it.
The owner of Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, won the first place in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year in the Slovensk<0xC3><0xBD> dom.
The jury then appreciated the effort through which he built a company with hundreds of millions of turnover from a small tool shop in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalica.
“I can say that the award has encouraged not only me but all of my co-workers and increased our confidence to compete against the competition,” said the winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history there was a desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father to rent a small workshop as compensation for the Communists’ confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his dad they started a company on plastic bathtubs.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater awareness even among the unprofessional public after achieving success in the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to see the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that they are cooperating with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, last year at Farmet was not only in the sign of euphoria of victories.
The award was based on the company’s financial results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of mechanical goods.
A crisis that had not yet affected citizens so much peaked, but firms were already halting their investment projects and beginning to restrict purchases of new machinery and technology.
"This situation, of course, has not escaped us."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and there were layoffs," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures from time to time.
However, they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, albeit less than before the crisis.
However, what Farmet has not discounted is the investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training center from the subsidies, we strengthened the presentation at international fairs, we received the main awards at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
It is clear that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again, and with it the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
A survey that removes nonsensical regulations
The Absurdity of the Year survey is the fourth part of the entrepreneurial contest.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year of the Absurdity of the Year poll became the obligation to carry documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
This was decided by more than a third of the less than four thousand voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, although an official can obtain it with two clicks of a mouse.
The poll will change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register during the checks on insurance premium payers," said Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Security Administration.
Light up all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and the pointless ones to cancel them are the meaning of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth time this year that it is part of the business competition organized by Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny and it is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If last year there were about three thousand voters, this year there were almost four thousand.
And no wonder, all sorts of legal obligations, which serve only to delay business, there is always enough and enough.
"For example, we are in the leading places in the world in the number of tax return leaflets," notes Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying business has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can submit administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. After that, the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for the "anticene" and will allow the public to vote on it during October via the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations that do not make sense, have been submitted to this year’s survey.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, as well as professional unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there was a requirement that cars for the maintenance of highways and expressways should pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets should paint every two years.
The list of this year’s seven proposals is published on the competition’s website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the happening, which is regularly attended by personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Trades of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted in this competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws the sticks under the feet of entrepreneurs, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to dismantle nonsensical regulations do not sound empty.
In 2007, people were most annoyed by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the booth to the exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trades Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office for his foreign employee a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the law on the so-called green card.
And for the third time, good luck.
The absurdity of 2009 was the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two walking scales in the office.
This was relaxed this year by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator fell off.
The new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
A novelty in this year’s fifth edition of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year competition.
This year’s first edition of this special sub-category of the Vodafone Company of the Year 2010 competition was attended by companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published in a separate article.
Although the subject of their activity differs diametrically from each other, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people, and in another, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen nationwide finalists was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of a foundation sponsoring disabled children for seventeen years.
The paper mill from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady takes care of its disabled employees, which has more than 70 percent of them, which is why it received the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and Vodafone Company of the Year ranked third in the region.
In Olomouc, the winner was the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionately reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for the fact that she preferably buys from Czech producers, supports civic activities in the vicinity and saves the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least possible impact on the environment," explains Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová, Managing Director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> Region thinks about the health of its employees and for each laptop they have ergonomic chairs and keyboards, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the Human in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their employees' pension insurance in the form of premium bonuses.
"In our country, we make allowances for food, transport, training and recreation," says Josef Strapa<0xC4><0x8D> from the Bruntál construction company Cz<0xC4><0x99>szcz, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically registered in the category Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer no later than August 15.
Incorrectly filled or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
“If the competitor’s representatives did not answer the question, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the “main” Vodafone Company of the Year competition.”
"It is not possible to register for this competition alone, as it is a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested during a public tender
In recent days, anti-corruption police have been arrested in the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen.
The detectives put the cuffs on a local entrepreneur in the media sphere and real estate trader Lubo<0xC5><0xA1>a G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public tender to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the tender would attract specific bidders.
He had to pay G. Lubo<0xC5><0xA1>i half a million crowns for it.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for misconduct in a public procurement and public tender," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsen state prosecutor's office, adding that further details regarding the ongoing investigation could not be provided.
The 46-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours.
The way in which he could have influenced the public tender can only be speculated, given the minimum of official information.
A spokeswoman for the Land Fund, Lubomíra <0xC4><0x8C>erná, said that police officers were actually arrested at a secluded workplace in Pilsen, during a public tender.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public tender has the correct title "Call for the submission of an offer of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and takes place in the event that several eligible applicants show interest in the offered land.
"These persons offer, within the framework of the invitation, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the offered entitlements, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest entitlements," explained the spokeswoman of the Fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information on who entered the call, and since he himself is also an eligible person, because he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered the land to the bidder that he would not participate in the competition.
Apparently, he's been collecting severance payments for that.
That would explain why he had such a large sum of money in custody.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He figured in the case of former PF boss Václav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for issuing land in a replacement restitution, on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was then that Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. received from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically at the place where the access road to the industrial zone Borská pole was to be built.
Later, he exchanged them very conveniently with the town hall for a house in the very historic center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to accept it, otherwise it would have jeopardized the construction by blocking the land.
Homeowners pay hundreds of dollars per month
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewage, heat supply and somewhere rents will increase.
From January, families will have to withdraw hundreds of crowns more per month from their wallets than they do now.
Electricity will increase by up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies, and in many cases central heating supplies will also become more expensive.
The price of electricity should cost households in apartments 100 crowns a year more expensive than now.
At the same time, the prices of power electricity have been reduced by all major suppliers, so a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics, is to blame.
The gas will increase slightly, but at a time when people are drowning the most and have the highest consumption.
They also have to pay hundreds of dollars more per year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive across the republic, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
Price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 crowns more per month for central heating from January, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
Residents of Prague, in turn, are threatened with more than 9 percent increase in water and sewage, in case the city increases rents from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, they will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower ones in the nationwide comparison.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage prices are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, the price of rents in 450,000 rental apartments may rise significantly, where regulation will end from January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, plans to increase the rent by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new level of rent, intend to bring the company to court.
The regulated rents that people pay in about 300,000 apartments could rise by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it acts slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally even a better brand of whisky stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that most often end up in the care of drunk doctors, who are not even fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly in the hospital from a monkey.
This is evidenced by the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases on the income of children's departments of hospitals.
“Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk on them.”
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," said Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, the head of the children's department of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"If they can get Daddy's bottle out of the closet, it's whiskey, but it's Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage of being poured into the juice and not smelling so much," he explained.
And the spokeswoman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová, also gives him the right.
"Most often it's Fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a plum tree that they brought from home," Jurino said.
According to Pelikán, 13- to 14-year-olds who drink in hospitals are quite common.
Prior to Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances are transporting schoolchildren from a wide area.
"There was a girl who lay with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with 3.5 ppm of extra blood alcohol in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at an exhibition site in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice for a dance party."
"What's interesting is that her mother didn't think it was special at all, that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," he said.
It is the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking of their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of growing child drunkenness.
However, according to experts, it is impossible to talk about addiction in the true sense of the word in children.
“Alcoholics are defined as several years of chronic dependence on alcohol, with all the phenomena involved, and this is not the case in children.”
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is more characteristic of a failed family-social background," explained the Primary Pelican.
According to a spokeswoman for Jurina, about forty drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol by mid-November this year.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will be included in the statistics.
Children who are taken by their parents or taken home by the police after outpatient treatment do not count.
In addition to the cases where children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of booze, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied on: the witch, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink grief from a bad record, or they celebrate the start of the holidays."
"However, I've seen seven children drunk at the same time," Pelican said.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically in the advantage over the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will prevent irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"They're actually better off because they've had a good wake-up after that beautiful evening experience and nothing hurts."
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelican admitted, sometimes spoiling the patients' pleasant mood by at least listing the cost of their treatment.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization in an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I calculated to those children on the visit how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to make money for that one party," Pelican added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not resort to regression procedures, in which they would recover the costs of treatment from their parents, in cases of child drunks.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for exercises or demonstrations.
It is a two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army and which was able to fly.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159s.
They are still preserved in Aero Vodochody and the broker of trade - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
According to Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the press department of defence, it is not yet known when the aircraft will be physically departed from Vodochod.
"The single-seat L-159 aircraft for the shift were set aside from the long-stayed aircraft, without additional deposits and investments from the Ministry's department."
"The two-seater L-159T1 has been replaced in its current state and form," he said.
He added that the army will not be left without two-seat aircraft, because in May 2009, the ministry signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth 200 million crowns to rebuild four unnecessary L-159 aircraft into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS undertook to put the aircraft into service with some Allied countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of the L-159 and will be used to train NATO pilots.”
"Therefore, it is up to the customer how he will implement this thing," Peszek said.
The newspaper Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny recently reported that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not open a tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly.
At the time, the defense leadership argued that the exchange would support future exports of L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech army has bought 72 machines from Aero and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft will probably have a court dock.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice because it had to select the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which should arrive at Prague’s Kbely airport within fourteen days.
Longer index finger than ring finger indicates lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than a ring finger are less likely to develop prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple prostate cancer risk test, especially for men under 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly when combined with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and more than 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the participants in the study had an index finger on their right hand shorter than a ring finger.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, for those who had the index finger longer than the ring finger, the risk decreased by 33 percent, while for men in their 60s it decreased by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Earlier research has shown that testosterone promotes the growth of prostate cancer.
Professor Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he was briefly aware of the study, but did not believe that the relationship between finger length and cancer was "fully proven".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly snow, roadmen in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometre in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars, and the D1 also stands near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher of the Central Motor Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK) told the newspaper.
A truck crashed in the 91st kilometre, two trucks collided in the 93rd kilometre, resulting in injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno on the 190th kilometre or drive through Brno and then drive on the 182nd kilometre to Kyvalka.
There are several miles of columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right at the arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a few centimeters of snow, the thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are created, for example, on Prosek, and <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff is due to sit down again.
Railways and airports are also in trouble.
The Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven high-speed trains due to snow.
Problems are, for example, the line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne airport was closed from Wednesday 11 am to 5 am.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already accessible, but only with increased caution.
In the Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov region, there are three side roads, in the Brno region there are snow languages, and in the Blanen region snow chains are necessary to overcome some roads in the above locations.
Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko was one of the most affected places.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
It will be necessary to put milling cutters into their stretching.
When they will be released, it is not yet possible to estimate.
Caution is needed in the area of the White Carpathians in Hodonín.
On the roads, which are maintained only by inert sprinkling to protect nature, there is up to five centimeters of snow.
In the Czech Republic, there was between two and ten centimeters of snow, most of which fell in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic gradually stops.
The U.S. military has a new “smart weapon.”
The U.S. military has deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only as the XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new gun is like a little super-precision cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm rounds, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive, actually function as small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed to explode not only when hitting a target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
Thus, they can be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, and when a murderous rain of steel fragments falls on it, it can put it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"In principle, the soldier treats it by finding the target, sending a laser beam to determine the distance, obtaining a specified point of intent, adjusting the direction accordingly, and pressing the tap."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
“When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires the missile at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters,” Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu will move its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The 400 employees will move from their current office building in Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year.
Fujitsu will move its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs from the current office building at Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex on Lyons Street in Frankfurt’s Niederrad district, in July next year.
According to a Fujist spokesperson, another 100 jobs of the group, which are currently divided in the region, should be relocated there in the near future.
The lease offer was said to be very attractive and the large offices in Astro Park were said to be more suited to the working way of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only on lease.
Competent managing director Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure in Frankfurt-Niederrad".
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday caused joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), Frankfurt’s chief economic officer, said the move had won a “global player”.
It is a “fantastic sign of trust in this place.”
Fujitsu is said to fit the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed in time by the management of the company of its intention.
"Of course we've offered our help to the firm," Korwisi said.
But friendly contacts could not change the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the landlord of the property in Marienbader-Platz.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is about avoiding a long non-occupation in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house in Rathaus Square, which had been used by Fujitsu until now, and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most discussed construction projects of the spa town ten years ago, along with other buildings in Marienbader Square.
A joint project of the city and a private designer, the so-called urban entree, was created between the railway station and the town hall, which was criticized both for the massive development of areas that previously served as parking lots and also for the height of buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, a manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then still affiliated with Siemens, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
Fujitsu Tokyo is the third-largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers available to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but the majority of Fujitsu employees are in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions will move to Frankfurt-Niederrad from Bad Homburg, followed by Fujitsu Services and TDS.
7000 square meters were leased in the Astro Park office building for this purpose.
In the complex - its name draws attention to the stellar floor plan, which is twenty years old, there is, among others, the central union of the electrical and electronics industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting into trouble.
The Internet service Amazon has turned off the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened due to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, is due to be delayed, according to a newspaper article in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free Speech in the Land of the Free," activists said in a tweet posted on Wednesday (local time).
Amazon recently downloaded WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic cables to handle the high number of accesses to documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks explained the move: “Okay – we’re going to spend our dollars now by employing people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, “then they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has halted the use of its servers for Wikileaks after fellow senator Joe Lieberman's associates carried out a search, CNN reported, based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate House Defense Committee has threatened to boycott Amazon, the Guardian reported.
“I would have wished Amazon would have taken this step sooner, given earlier disclosures of classified information on Wikileaks,” he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
“Wikileaks is acting illegally, outrageously and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life on the planet,” he said in a statement.
“No responsible company – either American or foreign – should assist Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent, a 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, Scotland Yard says it knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has always called the investigations in Sweden the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats.
"Even calls have been made for the assassination of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is rightly worried about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently reacted to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the person responsible for posting on Wikileaks be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, one adviser to the head of the government, Stephen Harper, said on television - probably ironically, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use a "target plane".
In the meantime, there has been a firing squad between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for recently issued espionage calls to diplomats.
“I’m not entirely sure why we care about one person’s opinion with the website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its websites.”
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the safety of its databanks.
The deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed special commissioner, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for the development of the "necessary structural reforms" that are needed after the release of reports from the embassy on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also said it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are to be put in danger by WikiLeaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary."
Ice Cream University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatiera and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a slightly outdated ice cream maker, produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the freezer with a spatula, wipes it into a wafer and sells it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
Anyone who wants to learn more about ice cream, however, can not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, an ice cream machine manufacturer set up an ice cream university to make ice cream from his machines match the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
There are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some crave a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others dare to the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the Ice-Cream industrial country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant who wants to start her own business after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia has arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The key is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the southern and patriotic cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there's a touch of romance to it."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the essential ingredients milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then turn the tap on the machine and pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream, flows out.
Immediately, the assistant professor is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you experiment on your own?
Luciano warns to let himself be carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Whoever talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently still used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will collide and the customer will eat only ice grains.
Certain variations of the base material are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of flavored ingredients on you."
"You should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with an ice cream from a white base mass that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa as a basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now participants can take a course on ice cream machines.
Luciano has them make four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream at each time - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be done with fruit types of ice cream.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - due to the taste, it's not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream will be made by a group that uses more fruit, less water, and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the mixture is balanced will the taste of Gelato be properly picked up, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano takes out a device to determine the sugar content of the fruit (the winemakers measure the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Ice cream production no longer requires as much physical exertion as before.
It does not only help the device for automatic production of the base material.
There is also a device that simultaneously soaks the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools to minus temperature.
In spite of all the automation, we can not avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time before something like this happens."
Auditors in a double light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is linked to an industry that is experimenting with genetic plants.
The accusation has now been made by a group of experts at Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute to estimate the effects of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve documented it well,” Christoph Then, the head of Testbiotech, said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been under contract with the Ilsi lobbying association for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestlé and Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in EFSA’s control regulations for genetic plants, and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
EFSA’s regulations are said to coincide in whole paragraphs with Ilsi’s documents, carrying a manuscript of the industry that should be checked by the office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from EFSA switched to the Swiss agrarian concern Syngenta without any additions or transition period - and thus changed sides.
Also, Radio Central Germany (MDR) recently revealed the staffing link between the EU-Office of Inspection and the industry lobby, which aroused the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members of Parliament.
In the meantime, EFSA cannot recognise a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, including those from the industry, if they are of high professional quality, it is stated in one statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contacts with industry.
But he must prove them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It describes itself as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics – among other things, to assess the risk of biotechnology without a contract lobbyist.
Independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempts, and that genetic plants are not being tested for response to environmental influences.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn will do in the field,” says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not provide reliable results.
"If they are not looking for risks, how can they be found?" the plaintiff asks Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The researcher has been researching gene engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, industry, like in the US, is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any scientists who are not connected with the companies.
Studies that are critical to society are usually not published.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck said.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, he was standing in front of the Stuttgart station, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is familiar: In September, excavators arrived and began to demolish a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar downsizing of the station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken to 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, a soft coarse stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
You secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
It reads: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When he cut one, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with those pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former ammunition dump of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all that was created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared to landfill," he says in his office, a wooden booth that used to be a guardhouse.
He says he was cursed and threatened when in September all the newspapers reported that he had bought the remnants of the North Wing from the company that was carrying out the demolition.
But he spoke to S-21 opponents for days.
He explained that he was not responsible for the demolition.
And when that happens, it's best to use the stones.
Then took about 200 S-21-adversaries each about one 80-kilogram heavy block, the price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also in the hope of returning it during rebuilding.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have long since sold out.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from every corner and towed what fit into the trunk and onto the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long since turned into "walls" or as the edges of flower beds with herbs.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it hadn't been for the political impulse."
He gets in his off-road car and goes for a ride through his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied first law, then biology, then computers, and eventually became a stone trader.
A lover of stones.
It has 40,000 tons of stones.
They bring their treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer in old stones in the republic.
It's braking.
In the snow lies artworked sandstone.
"Once they belonged to the Marien-Brücke in Dresden," he says.
Sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, excited.
"My favorite stone."
We continue on the way up through the woods.
Points to the pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
"Nice travertine."
Once those blocks belonged to the stand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Stones and stories lie everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the Stuttgart police presidium, red granite from the Sankt Blasien temple, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how stones used to be broken by hand and transported with simple hoists and bull carriages, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like that were crushed."
He didn't become rich, not very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker, and a gardener settled up in the woods.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the one who evaluates the remains.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
Stones will also be saved.
The Battle of Talents for High Potentials
There's a lot of people at the snack bar.
16 students are pressed by salmon loaves, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Volkswagen have invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with the VW developers, they are here to talk about the car of the future – and just by the way get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, like VW, and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates in the classrooms as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are interested in others.
Since universities don’t publish any lists of their students’ success, companies seek to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and gain them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automaker is trying to get talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department distributes pens, rubber teddies and plates with the VW logo.
He tells promising young talents about internship programs, student jobs and suggests them ways to join the group.
Nico Selle of TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
He sees benefits for both sides: “Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience.”
"VW can simultaneously get to know students, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be suitable as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not uncommon.
What is new, however, is that it is so openly fighting for students.
"Otherwise, it was a substantial professional project," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is likely to be even harder.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to select their employees from long lists of candidates.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract a particularly highly skilled workforce.
In particular, engineering graduates have an excellent bargaining position.
According to the VDI, 40,000 engineering posts remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called shortage of engineers will continue to grow.
Roman Dykta on talent hunting goes to the auditing and consulting firm KPMG.
Organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
At the same time, participants can view KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
It will be decided in advance in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested will fly to the USA.
In the battle for High Potentials at universities, the dictates will apply increasingly tougher laws.
"We want to make our Race different from the others."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like Dykt's talent hunter's in luck.
"We stayed in touch with all the participants in a similar event last year."
“Some will be leaving school soon and are planning to apply for a job with us,” he says.
In addition to direct contacting on campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented classically on the job markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"Like Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of HR at Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe is familiar with the issue of young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are listed on the company’s website.
"At the moment, it's difficult to fill vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform that it is possible to do an internship or write a diploma thesis with us."
The solar specialist does not organize any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract with other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
“Great companies often can’t offer this,” says the head of Stübe’s personal department.
In the search for a job, money has not played a major role for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good progress opportunities are other decisive factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the personal department, Stübe, hopes that her placement will bring points to job seekers.
"I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Employer Branding Academy of Germany advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
It advises its customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
Professionally, this is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of an employer on the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a rope game," says Kriegler.
Obama to stop new oil drilling
In the coming years, no new oil wells will be built off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban – and thus finally cancelled earlier plans.
New drilling is also banned off the Atlantic coast.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April.
Before this disaster, which cost 11 workers their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the U.S., President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to pressure the opposition and industry to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents are trying to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The center of criticism is the British energetic concern BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted a drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies applied for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with tighter controls and strict security regulations.
At the moment, the supervisory authority is being fundamentally reformed, which has drawn attention to itself with many corruption accusations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would abolish the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that tighter regulation will drastically reduce the amount of oil produced in the Gulf.
“Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industries,” the BDO consulting firm said in a recent survey, ahead of a drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the industry’s uncertainty: “Nobody knows exactly what regulation will change.”
Investments in new mining projects are being pushed forward until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of litres of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni area of Nigeria.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," the environmental activist reassures the journalists: "You'll get enough oil mud in front of your lens today."
A 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy wading down his chest in water surrounded by smudges: the scene looks almost beautiful in rainbow-colored water gloss.
The fact that brown oil deposits float under the surface is not visible.
It used to collect a lot of garnish in containers here, tells Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil spilled into a huge wet area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River Delta, is one of the worst infested areas in the world.
On the way down the river through mangrove swamps with a lot of side tributaries, the entire range of the trigger is only noticeable.
The motor of the boat boils brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever immerses his hand in the water pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves rise from the ground like black licorice sticks, rarely occurring palm trees let their leaves sadly hang.
We are looking in vain for flocks of birds that are common in wet areas: As soon as the engine on the boat goes silent, there is a frightening silence in the former paradise, where it smells like a pump.
“What is going on here is the ecological conduct of war,” says Celestine Akpobari sadly: “We live in constant fear for our health.”
The comparison with war is justified.
The settlement area of Ogoni is a battlefield where the first conquerors from Europe have been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first resistance was formed here with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa in the 1980s, here Shell had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire delta area of three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining wells and 7,000 kilometers of management of more than two million barrels of black gold, is still being exploited daily, the oil fields in the Ogoni area are very unstable for the concern.
Every few hundred meters, the water of the steel structure rises like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so too gently are called the heads of drill holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty.
At any moment, such a drilling hole head breaks, says Akpobari, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres of oil have spilled into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil spilled into the sea off Alaska in the Exxon Valdez supertanker disaster 21 years ago is one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
There is controversy over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell describes sabotage and organized theft of oil as more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists have cited bursting borehole heads and leaky lines as the root cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner said in 2008: “Only the number of faults in the wires is said to be “several times higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks remotely like a deserted, oil-stained open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and oiled to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by a conduit, partly arbitrarily scattered over the ground, a fire is burning: an illegal small refinery.
Oil is heated in a barrel over a fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline flows out of the wiring into the catchment pot, later, kerosene drips at the end of the wiring, and finally, diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: “We’ll make 34,000 Naira” – about $22.
Delta residents are exploiting chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of diesel can still be surpassed by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that connect to the lines everywhere in the Ogoni region: experts say at least 16 million litres of oil are lost every day in the entire Niger Delta region.
But only a negligible fraction of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: the largest share is filled by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, into tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate about whether the disaster was caused by the inhabitants and their interventions or the lax production method is considered by activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not considered intruders, and if they did not so perfectly destroy the life of fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft, and no illegal refineries.”
Meanwhile, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell is so damaged that only the departure of the group is considered: “Perhaps other nations as the Chinese will prove to be better.”
Michael is annoyed.
"It's high time you disappeared," says the muscular manufacturer.
"Soldiers could be here any minute."
If they're found by a special military unit, they're not in jail, they're in danger of a painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This cursed thing has gotten our land to the bottom in every way," Akpobari says.
Investigators have discovered a building flaw in the A380 engines.
The A380 appears to have a major security flaw.
Investigators inspected the machine, which landed in an emergency, and found a possible construction defect that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas has filed a lawsuit against the engine manufacturer.
Qantas passengers were apparently more fortunate than previously known when they landed in early November: Australia’s aviation safety authority found a major safety defect in some A380 engines during its investigations – and now warns of a possible construction defect.
Perhaps the defect would have serious consequences: cracks could occur at one oil joint due to wear, an ATSB statement said on Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It provided the grounds for the action before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and the load-bearing surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce says burning oil was the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough for all concerned to be informed.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its 11 A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced an A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National Snowfall Causes Chaos in Transportation
All of Germany in white: almost all of the country snowed overnight.
On many roads, chaos reigns, connections trains and planes are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the entire republic has fallen into snow on Thursday night in freezing temperatures - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, up to 15 centimeters of snow lie in some places.
Several motorways and many roads are heavily constrained by traffic.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but could not handle the newly flopped snow.
In addition, there was a strong gust of wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein expects a storm surge in the morning with a water level of 1.2 meters above normal.
Snowstorms have caused significant problems on motorways and state roads in Saxony.
According to Meteomedia’s bad weather headquarters, the alert level in Saxon Switzerland was purple – the highest level ever.
Part of it was 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds causing blizzards.
There were several trucks and cars left overnight.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major problems on the roads.
The wind and snow caused slow traffic and traffic jams on the A2.
There were problems in Thuringia due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Thuringia Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers on the train were given wool blankets, food and drink by firefighters and rescuers.
The snow was blowing across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled at major German airports due to snow winds.
According to a spokesperson for the flight information center, cancelled flights have already been reported from Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have been cancelled, according to a spokesperson for Fraport.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
Although few passengers remain unconnected at the airport, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, one truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to a snowy road: a truck was also caught at a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she rolled over onto a slippery road near Aschaffenburg with her car.
However, meteorologists have good news: snow will remain in the form of light powder, and therefore will rise even in light gusts of wind.
But the wind's getting weaker.
Only on the Baltic Sea will there be fast winds with the strength of a storm.
But it will be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to a newspaper article, the bank is looking for buyers for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could be worth up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernised; meanwhile, bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial concern seems to want the cost of the renovation back - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, according to the Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
“We are still exploring whether it makes more sense to own or sell the property and then rent it again,” he said.
With this, the largest credit institution in Germany is once again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from its own fund investors and subsequently costly renovations.
According to the data, the energy conversion swallowed about 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the meanwhile renamed towers to "Greentowers" at a price of about 500 million euros.
The spokesperson said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the memory of buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions at the mine.
The rescue of the dead has not yet been possible, as the security situation in the shaft continues to be complicated.
Nearly two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were stranded in the mine.
The probe was launched into the shaft where the accident had occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
The second strong detonation was based on the fact that the miners no longer have any chance of survival.
We still haven't been able to rescue the dead.
Now they honor the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand gathered ten thousand people in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
To honor the memory of the buried miners, 29 tables were erected, with helmets, lanterns and miners' names on them.
Also pictures and personal belongings such as clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
Flags were hovering half-mast on government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would again emerge from the “deep of the earth” to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants in the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he's seen his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was swept up in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative event.
British and South African miners were also killed in the November 19 explosion.
Rescuers began by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gases are dissolved, it will begin to cool the high temperatures inside the mine, Police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, warriors!
Is Horror Suitable for Art Cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to break the old boundaries again with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What kind of audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he was filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his opponents almost with supernatural force - this sounds ideal for young male viewers who are looking for bloody action, because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and his enemies when he tears even the insides of his belly.
On the other hand, One-Eyed, as he is actually called, will not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters will say one or two sentences at the most, or be drawn to agonizing dying cries.
Otherwise, they are silent and luxuriant in the terribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera footage.
It is good when the film has multiple target audiences, it is only a pity when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his savage and stylized drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists bringing his work closer to either the mainstream with more humor or less brutality to the art audience.
Most fans of art cinema are likely to be discouraged by splashing brains and guts everywhere.
Fans of action films will get bored no later than the moment when the One-Eyed sets out for freely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries on ships to Jerusalem and stays hung for eternity in the wind and fog until the crew apparently arrives in America and keeps silent there.
It is therefore no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" did not get into theaters in Germany and was now released only on DVD.
It is a pity mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, sometimes even crumbling blood, there is an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
In this film, it’s not about the dialogues or the exact plot, it’s all about the atmosphere, the feverish dream that became the movie.
And that's not an escape for the viewer.
Refn does not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly chokes him with his chilly footage and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all with the indescribable hatred that flows from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One-Eyed keeps something like innocence, all the rest are driven by anger.
Of all the most one-eyed hero, whose motives will never be explained, who will become a time for enemies and temporary allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an ambassador of the devil.
It portrays destruction, but perhaps only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
The experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued new warnings about its secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression - and will not allow control.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents its name when it comes to a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
Based on a U.S.-U.S. foreign intelligence agency report at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known by the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well-suited for the production of plutonium – from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technology of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, she clarified where the reactor components might have been before the destruction, which is a smaller copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, there were still photographs that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was reportedly shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, not much more is known than at that time, even the riddles have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in al-Kibar, but basically had no evidence that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence agencies in Europe are even more cautious and only talk about the “supposed reactor”, even though they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “credible”.
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how certain he was of having the reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said last summer that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The debris of the allegedly “unused military building” was quickly cleared by the Syrians and properly leveled the terrain.
Still, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors from the period immediately after the attack through the member state, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market, because they were exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program, nor has it built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
This was refuted by the IAEA after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite images.
In addition, he forbade the auditors from carrying out a second inspection at el-Kibar and from accessing the debris of the bombed building.
Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation into the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and is "increasing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna admitted - after all, this is a serious violation of the IAEA's nuclear arms ban treaty.
The IAEA considers three more facilities to be “functional” with the alleged reactor — and, unlike the reactor, still exist — as the key to advancing the matter.
The auditors have not yet specified which devices are involved, what function they have or why they are suspected.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again from nearby cities.
An independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., identified the objects and found a complex of buildings in satellite images, which is probably one of the suspected objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - exactly for this reason, Syria refuses IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was reported that the Syrians were afraid of a so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the US to search for military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence, as well as satellite images, that material was being transported back and forth between these three locations and the Euphrates Square.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one of the furnishings should be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there is “no evidence of sensitive activities”, i.e. enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor is powered by unenriched uranium.
But where that uranium comes from and where plutonium should later be split into a bomb, there are only likely estimates for these central questions.
It is also not known whether the debris, which could hide important traces, are hidden in these three places.
As if hundreds of cargo trucks had disappeared from the surface of the earth, no one seemed to know where the rubble had gotten.
Only a few kilometers away from al-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria had checked in 1998 as a suitable radioactive waste depot, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned Jane’s Intelligence Review.
Images from space, however, show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all suspicious earthwork sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months developing a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep potential military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest the auditors have.
Damascus also rejected the proposal.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring that the reactor had been destroyed and therefore the thing was not on fire, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce checks.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to design the inspections, has already spoken about "the options I'm inclined to in the future," but hesitates so far.
This choice carries a great deal of risk: On the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA governing council, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie began working on the still unnamed directorial debut in the summer, trouble has arisen.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known yet - but it also causes restlessness.
It has been said that the woman, who is a Muslim, will fall in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations protested immediately, so the planned filming was moved quickly from Sarajevo to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but in Bosnia it is still being protested.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN refugee agency UNHCR asking for a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper now reported - Jolie is also the UN refugee agency's ambassador.
She’s not exactly diplomatic, she offered to meet women in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In rape camps, love stories have not been told, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims reveals enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended to the UN refugee agency that Jolie be released as an ambassador.
What scenes did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her script to read, allowed filming after minor strife in Sarajevo - it's not entirely clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author emphasizes that she does not pursue any political intentions in her film, that she devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains uncertain.
There is another version of the film circulating on the Internet that sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war began, and they meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim woman, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which sounds a lot different than "a rape victim falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie’s movie really begins before the war is true.
Jolie argues that she is under pressure, which "is not fair and is based on false information".
Now the hackers of Hollywood can rescue her: by publishing her script illegally on the Internet, as they have done so many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening is once again good for the Irish.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates the power significantly over their guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans scream with joy at the sound of loud music, kicking their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in Cork, Ireland, is boiling as players throw tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer mugs — and they hit each other.
"Beer pong" is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this screaming beer game and a restrained computer scientist don't get along very well.
Still, the 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, distracting himself from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play passion in Las Vegas, he is going to New Zealand for an interview in January.
"I have a strange feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she instantly got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," the young man says, smiling.
Due to the poor prospects at home, two out of three Tanner siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
Boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
Hundreds of thousands of Irish will leave the country in the near future, according to experts from the ESRI Institute of Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
It is estimated that by 2015 there will be 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small country of only 4.5 million people, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of emigration as Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of ascension that has brought great prosperity to the Irish, discontent is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly damaging to young, educated Irish, who have so far only experienced an upsurge.
The loss of employment and social descent seemed absurd in these boom years.
Everyone was in need, money was wasted.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers complaining: "In Ireland, everything goes downhill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, goes away, and our country loses a whole generation."
"Please let the last one go out."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students’ Union, sees the future blackly because the government is only lying and offers young people no prospects for the future.
“They’re cutting the minimum wage, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” she said.
She watches her classmates go from one unpaid intern to the next.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to look at the subject in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers general service on the topic of working abroad.
“For beginners in the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website there are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
Sean O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues at a construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works extra shifts to repay the house loan at home.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says when he crosses the threshold of his own house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm not at all."
He laughs embarrassed and walks through cold rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, large expensive cars are parked in the entrances.
O’Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros – 100% financed by a loan.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you worried that the loan might not work out well?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, fills in the hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
A civil engineer doesn't like the whining he hears so often now.
"No one needs to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we will feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells the story of his father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes the idea.
Keep the future open and simply wait for life to evolve elsewhere.
He has also been working in London for several years, and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there’s one more thing that worries him these days: celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she's gonna screw up for her farewell party.
"Mostly no emotion," he says, and drinks a good beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the support for private entrepreneurship.
Criminal activity is more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered by many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómetro survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
This year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related issues.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several Pacific periphery countries in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy was recovering from a deep decline in output last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced Democrats, downplaying the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, this is a large increase (Figure 3).
Approximately 34% said they trusted the parliament in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same numbers as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
Support arose during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latinos living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood varies from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has worsened.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say either they themselves or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but that’s down from 38% last year and is also the lowest figure since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private entrepreneurship and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private entrepreneurship is essential for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that a market economy is the only system that will enable their country’s development, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela share the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the region, as 19% of respondents mentioned (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critical choices
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were much worse than the outsiders trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
Elections were filled with urns and repeated ballots, ballots scattered across channels, shattered polling stations, and intimidation.
The polling stations are open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering around trying to figure out where to go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed predecessors, shouted that it was a scam and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said it was "a pretty good choice in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive duel is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, have stepped down from their original call for the vote to be declared void.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is labelled by the Electoral Commission as having achieved a decisive duel.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voter turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Approximately 250,000 ID cards, which are necessary for voting, remained undistributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And it is clear that the Haitians will do it themselves.
Tips to the center
In the weeks since she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, Argentina’s president, has benefited from public sympathy, with her popularity rising from 20 percent to more than 50 percent, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections may depend on the grieving Mrs Fernández giving up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs will all be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to pursue economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized by Mr. Kirchner's death to a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which the government was slapped and accused of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also be valid for next year, with the president having more room to spend as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: up to 9% growth is likely this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists speak of a figure approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, prioritized growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and purged INDEC, the statistical agency that agreed to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by rising world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is signalling that she wants to rebuild Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck a deal with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure debt that Argentina had not paid back in 2001.
President Fernández now faces an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be overseen by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide “technical assistance” to propose a new national consumer-price index that would resemble an introduction to INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after her term ends, when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
By the time Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will be declining.
If she wants to win the next election, she will have to decide whether it is not necessary to quietly renounce many of the views that her husband held in politics.
Half the Encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible voters, voted for mayors and city councils in five city districts on November 27, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself is a representative of the sentiments that dominate the mainland and have a strong place in business relations, including a partially free trade agreement, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only tightly.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favour of greater Taiwan independence, received almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was in the city councils together with the KMT.
Elections were held like most of Taiwan's elections, which included noisy election trucks and mass rallies with flags with sluggishly dressed girls.
It even included a mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary Chairman of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly over the face, wounded him and killed the spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting influenced the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates fought over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
The KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also given up stirring up anti-China stances.
It is a reaction to the fact and realization that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that the policy of China is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in the first place.
It will be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was on the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President in 2000-08 was a rebel and a proponent of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation has evolved that is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was cited as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything possible to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as the contact point between the PPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "credible alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious with this move.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would fare better if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen’s intervention, the DPP will struggle to choose among potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessments were wrong, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will reorganize his cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, “the point of no return has already passed.”
Grammy nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
Speech at the request of the President and the people must necessarily be noted.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, has been hailed as one of this year’s Grammy Award surprises with a nomination for Best New Artist.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album Esperanza came out, the nomination came a little late, but this is in line with Grammy rules, where an artist may not release more than three albums before "the artist's public identity is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly recorded a step forward and thanks to her carefree vocal style and agile hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success, which in 2003 was recorded by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent of this category in the last years, who voted for the Grammys.
Elsewhere, the Grammy juries rightly recognize the Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" album in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against experienced saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a hoarse New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO’s “Treme,” was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise favored by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber’s albums.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's knowledge of steampunk has earned several well-deserved acclaim in the big band category, with the chamber jazz ensemble Childs Ensemble and the still-brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards Nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey Lead in Classical Music
Nominated for classical music at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, they have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with a score of five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a score of three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California were Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win an award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for producer of classical music of the year has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
Nominated for a classic album by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Chig Orchestra and the Cascal Artwork Project
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; "Adolf Hasse" and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kai Saaria and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchestra-Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shcheder and "The Encherrin" by the Orchestra.
Composers nominated for Grammys for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute episode is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for the instrumental performance of the soloist with the orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it with Middle Eastern tones and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for directing the Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists nominated include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula receives the approval of the planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics attacked the project, saying it promoted terrorism and would lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project -- Christians, Jews, anyone you remember," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
“The opposition is minimal,” he added.
"Those who oppose it only shout loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time was occupied by discussions with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"America doesn't exist anymore," one comment came up.
"We're the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty buried in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had been plagued in Riverside County for years without an incident, but he wanted a larger and more convenient space than the storage space he rented together with a manufacturer of filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot Mediterranean-style mosque will also have two minarets and grow to 43 feet in height.
It should occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the scope for searching for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, claiming it is a sign that life has possibilities that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and fundamental so far.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not evidence that this is some form of truly 'extraterrestrial' life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time it was considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after arsenic is replaced with phosphorus.
“You start to wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life beyond Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report published to discuss the discovery, which did not reveal the details of the finding, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry, and that a set of elements we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explains Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't an accident.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she considered that a microbe that is exposed to both elements may be able to replace one after the other.
"Arsene is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, it is very difficult for organisms to separate these elements."
"However, arsenic is so different that, like phosphorus, it does not work. Once it gets into the body, it begins to work in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic, which the bacteria are able to adapt to and grow.
Microbes grow better when exposed to phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic may occur naturally increases, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic being replaced by phosphorus was not new, but there was never an example to prove it.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and scientists speculated that it could have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it formed in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from the Bellflower Motel have been found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said Thursday.
Four exhibit dogs -- two Akitas and a Welsh pembroke corgis -- disappeared on Tuesday when a 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night at the Bellflower 6 motel was stolen, authorities said.
The two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the other two dogs were discovered on Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Police Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not contacted to comment on the case.
They were delighted when their two Akitas were found in a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akita Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old bitch Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to take part in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undetected until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on a couple’s nearly monthly trip to dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs – a puppy boxer, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Breton dog – who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akita and Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car, where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported a car theft at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who led them to the missing dogs, and the dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It was unclear on Thursday whether the prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to shout again now that the restructuring of MGM is getting final approval from the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start over.
A federal insolvency judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed creditors' "pre-packaged" plan to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
Thursday’s ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code leaves MGM with no legal impediments to restart Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become chief executives of the slimmed-down studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on the planned financial resources allowing a $500 million loan to fund MGM’s new operations and productions.
Now it is a merger with an investment bank that itself needs $75 million and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to settle their finances as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and sales expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 lenders of the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay US$2 billion plus the funding demanded by the lenders.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board, and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussions and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the lender at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services, will receive a success fee of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together a design for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to contribute to the financing of two films, which will be based on the book "The Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, was looking to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, the company he is the largest shareholder in.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
This year's leading candidate is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system, but in both cases it is a significant impact on the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels for $ 99, and one Kinect game costs the same as 10 beads jumpers or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers – Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club – and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s law was working; this year’s technology toys have far more power, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, than in previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys with associated sites have emerged, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices quoted are from Toys "R" Us, except as otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years old) are plush animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
With one press, the animal gives a tone and the second press starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animated doll from Elmo Live technology that can play Simon Says and can also walk on the moon thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel lock.
Children are testing Mickey's dance instructor's toy, although their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you may remember the Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn driving a car into fun-to-work with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you’re looking for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest easy-to-use variant, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not have as effective learning as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first major change to the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older drives.
The iXL by Fisher-Price ($90, for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a set of five cubes that are no larger than a box of matches, each of them has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing dice in a row before time runs out; it’s great for competing in improvised word formation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two toys, Webkinz and Club Penguin, were the most represented in toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $ 5, for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, a roller skate or a pet Puffle.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years), the latest in the range of microrobots on a button battery.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's fun when you make a maze of dice and see if he manages to find a way out.
It is also very resilient.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
Imposition of softer police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked the square, strictly controlled his orders, and gave orders in low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members - China's strong-willed urban law-enforcers, feared and despised for their harsh interventions and passion for violence - to convey a certain impression to the crowd around them.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, he whispers softly, "how pretty girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood at attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are arranged according to the ruler.
Four headgear perfectly fit on the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said scornfully.
"Models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city guards in China.
One city ordered that the new brethren should have a higher education.
The province of Guangdong has changed its gray-green uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue one.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced staring eyes with powerful weapons: in 2009, a report said 50 officers had steadfastly surrounded the snack cart and stared at the owner until the doorman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose surgery as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police with 13 women, who were selected specifically for their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also the softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city decree, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province beat a non-participating viewer to death after he used his phone to film what they were doing during a protest against a landfill.
Last year there was a training of police officers in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. Among other things, the manual was a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators without blood marks.
This year, a door-to-door melon trader in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left-brain injury.
A video game full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, shows Chinese policemen attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan scared the government,” China Daily, the national edition, lamented last year after another discussion about the tactics.
On the paper was written, "Really thorough cleansing."
Skeptics say this approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district required female applicants aged 18 to 22 with a good physique and "five facial features in the right proportions."
Adepts should have a height higher than the diameter - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the job is psychologically too demanding for women over the age of 25.
"Their image is an important thing," one unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com, as if on a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and "internal qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, “Besides being vases, they will also have other responsibilities.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city management, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are common in China for other jobs, for both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
This means that the issue of good looks is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Disability or disability will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or humpbacked man to serve with us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, with faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist character, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her dimpled collaborator, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says, "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are bigger than just driving traders into the alleys where they can carry out their business.
Every morning, a group stands up against more than a dozen marketers running around on foot or on bicycles, trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they are expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu, as the marketer began to run, leaving his wheel with the noodle cart for a while.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than tedious.
“It’s basically the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in her free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the same powers as their male counterparts to confiscate the goods from the seller.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after false rumours spread that police officers had killed salespeople.
More than a dozen police officers or officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where the policewoman was patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Police seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by law.
The owner of the bicycle could cry as he wished.
15 minutes away from the police, looking furious, elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over the age of 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintaining and smoothing the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said.
"Most of the time, it's the public who starts it."
U.S. Attorneys Won't Blame Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Justice Department have cleared Senator John Ensigna of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure a lobby, his lawyers said on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, has faced and was, until the time of the scandal, considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair made national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said it was "certainly pleased" with the decision, which followed almost a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings before the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department “has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that there is no plan to bring further charges against him in this matter.”
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department, who claimed there was substantial evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate a federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was supposed to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after Mr. Hampton was hired to lobby for them, so much so as to cite documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was banned from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared in violation of the lobbying ban.
The evidence that was released "shows that this is a clear case of preparing a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are being investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the Department was cautious about political lawsuits after a number of setbacks, including last year's decision to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens for questioning the state's indictment.
Federal prosecutors “clearly hid guns,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of lawyers who filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"It basically indicates that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from the Justice Department’s attorney general on Monday and then the next day, telling him that the department had found no charges against his client.
Mr Ensign’s defense team is working with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he forwarded to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable detailing my discussions with the Department of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to close an investigation into a separate complaint in which an ethical group accused Ensign’s parents’ $96,000 payment to the Hamptons of violating federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One December 2008 email showed that after Mr. Hampton began working as a lobbyist at the company, Mr. Ensign's employee manager, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "drilled" into the Home Office about the subject being discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When the scandal first surfaced last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes the ethics committee will quickly follow the Justice Department and close the entire investigation.
“Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing her hard work on behalf of the Nevada people,” she said.
Cheshire Municipality's Call to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they were sending messages about the horrific testimony via Twitter.
Lastly, the defense says that more than 140,000 tweets dealt with raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, a family, was scheduled to end with the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that would likely have occupied the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that intense reporting on the trial – including the widespread use of Twitter by top reporters – created a “circus atmosphere” and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then misled the jury into making decisions in the sense of influencing the public’s opinion.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether, with the advent of new technologies, new rules in the courtroom are also required.
“As I have seen in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom will affect the rights of fair trial for individuals,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes’s chief counsel.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue, of the state’s Supreme Court, briefly rejected the allegations regarding last week’s decree, saying the media was “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under public influence.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the justice of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, saying in his ruling that the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case was a "carnival atmosphere" at the media trial.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and film "The Refugee".
Some lawyers have said that the appeal courts that reviewed Hayes’ verdict half a century later might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be needed to determine how to communicate from courtrooms, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is general cause for concern about the impact of the new media” in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of law at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be interested in the idea that restricting direct communication from courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes’ lawyers who would have been able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
Advocates also argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes’ case may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrifying criminal photographs when selecting a jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, who became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Advocates say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge wrongly dismissed a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They said in an objection to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was being debated during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media were constantly igniting the flames of emotion in this case.
"The daily surge of media, cameras and reporters in court," the lawyer wrote, "was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven, and it may also be a nationwide rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that immediate reporting was more outrageous than later reports, and from their point of view, the judicial police should govern the scope of other trials.
But some lawyers have demanded appeal courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require adapting the courts.
Mr Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in the Dr. Sheppard case, due to the breadth of the trial, and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness overcome the abyss?
After a campaign that was notable for its offensiveness and negativity, a small amount of politeness emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first sign of genuine cooperation between the two political parties, or just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and parliamentary leaders brought no major breakthroughs on the crucial issues that need to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion about the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as the definition of their joint responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party struggle.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close cooperation over several months has built mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still divides the members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in probation - probing each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday’s meeting and its later assessment by the participants was also carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles apart.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"These are inevitable after the elections.
The election stirred the emotions of the parties, and they then quieted.
It's good."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed in the session, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts at the end of the year have expired, and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Likewise, a likely compromise on unemployment benefits is just because Republicans can’t watch how they support tax cuts for the wealthy while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After Tuesday's White House talks, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful collaboration on critical issues will not necessarily lead to a two-party relationship when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
"Once the things that have to be done are done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short run," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is largely widespread - that politeness will lead them to genuine cooperation.
“I look at everything that’s going on between now and 2012 as a shadow box when the main events happen in 2012,” he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the Tea Party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act on their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These supportive lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing spending.
Joint chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest tasks in Washington and have, in their view, put pressure on the deficit issue to public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in an 18-member commission to present their plan as an official recommendation and fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest resistance is among the elected officials on the jury, who suggest that, in the case of financial issues, at least today, we have little basis or the will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will start next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans will call on Obama to address budgets, taxes and healthcare, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What will cause the shift?
The public opinion.
There is plenty of evidence that, despite being partisan in the last election, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could go to a heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very closely watching the public reaction.
Anyone who is threatened with a vote cut is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of things.
The partisanship and orientation is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there is a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than there was with the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the politeness that has emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. Document Describes Moscow as a Refuge of Corruption
The administration of the city is in the hands of “kleptocracy” and it continues with part of the bribes and protection bribes that come on the way to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia said in February records.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of the office” – takes its toll when money starts moving up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on the sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was impeached in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we have seen only minimal changes in purges.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design firm, have repeatedly denied corruption allegations for many years, and won several lawsuits on false charges for such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when asked about the evidence of corruption: “It’s crazy, it’s filth, it’s filth.”
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show up in a vote.
However, it is unusual to see such details spoken in such a way, in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
“The Moscow city government and its connections to criminal elements have led some to call it ‘disfunctional,’ and confirm that the government operates more like a kleptocracy than a government,” the report says.
“Criminal elements enjoy the so-called ‘krysha’ (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means ‘roof’ or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Public Prosecutor’s Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts have identified a three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Home Office and Militia are on the second level."
"Finally, at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
“It’s an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill in the blanks in some areas because the city does not provide some services.”
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, “Moscow shop owners realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than organized criminal groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and strength than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
"That's why protection from criminal gangs is no longer on the line."
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is complex, the protection itself can already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their stores are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has repeatedly spoken about the fight against corruption, but has admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably packed with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow’s Indem research team, in a recent interview.
“It’s part of the bureaucracy.”
He is not a member of a political class because there are no longer any political classes in Russia.
Without politicians, without opposition, without power-sharing, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (countries ranked from least to most corrupt).
The unveiling of the U.S. embassy report, which appeared in Moscow only in the late evening, certainly did not stir the Russian government’s enthusiasm, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be blamed for Moscow’s shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue on the issue of resolving the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin said the documents WikiLeaks published could have been forged and reacted angrily to statements that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to deal with the past
In a sparingly lit concrete classroom with stained and peeled walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves the Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," Sreng Kor Ma, 42, said.
Known as the “butcher” for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge state in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge relinquished power, long-standing loyalty is also broken in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims at the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain to children the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, jointly by the UN and the Cambodian Court, the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the sentencing of the former leader of the notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advancement, unrest grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to rejoin Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s documentation center, an independent organization that studies the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to transition to a government that culminated in the capitulation of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters had fallen into the ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several of the elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unskilled farmers.
"These people benefited only minimally from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were upbringing without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"The Mok nourished them all."
"But now life is hard, because we have to take care of everything ourselves."
The ongoing trial of the Khmer Rouge has also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will start investigating Nuon Che, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute leading perpetrators and those responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to appease the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation centered on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court searches for more suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer proportions means sticking together broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center published the first textbook approved by the government about the Khmer Rouge, it has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the Department of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home the book for study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be prosecuted."
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complicated and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a strong charm here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains is a weed-covered road sprinkled with thrown plastic bags that leads to a black soot rectangle covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and she planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to appear to have stockpiled uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was made public in a joint statement issued after a security summit between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has been trying to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that they hit the rock last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a couple of clandestine operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's deal to remove the remainder of the material - about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, as this is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was excluded.
And it was probably a good move to secure an invitation for the former Soviet Republic to the ensuing summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
“This proves that the process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group supporting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the deal a "very significant, important step" from Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged to secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries dispose of all their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
Dozens of countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama summit on nuclear security, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our commodity... We’re not going to make dirty bombs and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus acceded to the United States a few months ago and has shown interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on supplying less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research institute, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
“Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on a basis of trust,” which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
According to the joint statement, Belarus will seek to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's brutal repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and this is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not do expensive with CIA flights
The Spanish government has not made expensive flights by the CIA carrying imprisoned Taliban and al-Qaeda members to Guantánamo through Spanish territory, as the US envoy to Madrid expressed in his telegram.
This is according to documents provided by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, which also says that the then First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "so could show that it has proper supervision of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting took place between US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's announcement "put the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with the flights of secret services through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "caught unprepared," Aguirre said in one of the documents.
The then foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also hinted to the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the matter the lowest possible outline, but by the fact that the matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited powers of influence."
In February 2007, Attorney General Vicente González told the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he had no intention of blocking the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Department of Defense relating to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated file or any sensitive information," the embassy said in a statement.
However, the U.S. has expressed concerns about "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than the declassification of information by the CNI or the Department of Defense.
“This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch of the U.S. Ambassador and Secretary of the Interior Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba, the ambassador said that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate," he had already instructed his colleagues to "avoid the intentional fires."
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the actions of the Popular Party (PP) in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Popular Party will not hesitate to exploit any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these disclosures could have negative consequences for the U.S. government.”
Confessed mother-murderer complained on the network about maternity "care"
The young woman was talking about the baby when she was already dead, and she had her blog: "Terror in Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
With this nickname, which she had been using since childhood, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both of them are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruña, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life, which ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimonies of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had a DNA test done.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palma.
However, from the content of her communication, it is clear that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes, "Alberto is kind of upset that I left for work."
"When I told him, he thought it was good, but now he realizes he has to be with the little one all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about a text message she just received: “I want you to come back this month or give me the address where to send your baby.”
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the little one with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May, he says of his return to his home: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only staying until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go to work so I don't lose that place."
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son with him.
"He'll be with whoever he's supposed to be, me, and I'll never leave him with anyone but my mother again," a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
There is another post in July.
When he taps this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Cesar is satisfied on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school, so I'll save some money for the nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to e-mail, look how he wants, he's going to meet me, sex is necessary."
Thirty-nineth, another message: "The boy's doing well, going to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one report about Victor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet, Mónica posts on anime and manga blogs.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she used to call herself "Mookie the Ex-Prisoner."
"Terror in Galician (motto) ".
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that it all happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca.
Defendant Carlos Maceda said the defendant did not remember how the incident happened and “did not intend to harm the child in any way”.
She had previously confessed to drowning Caesar in a bathtub and putting his body in a trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric examination.
The People's Party would gain 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 seats
With the results of 28 November, the PP party could have the lead in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes won and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia) already has a given idea about the general elections, whether there will be an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in the national elections is usually positive.
In 2008, the Catalan People's Party won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the autonomous elections of 2006 this number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received 384,091 votes.
If this trend of increase is maintained, which was supported by at least 25 votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if general elections are held, the PPC could gain 12 deputies in the House compared to the current 8, the CiU party (Convergencia i Unió) and the Pú<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC5><0xBE>ti party (Convergencia i Unió) also won.
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis, the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one MP - now it has three - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would still have one mandate, or gain another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest event will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the People's Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist domination in the four provincial capitals, as well as on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget for 2011 - 661 million euros.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get a majority and could not turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV.
Given the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona Assembly - since it needs to get at least 5% of the votes.
The PP party has increased the number of votes won in four capital cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled alongside the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
They also won at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
PP currently has representation in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell gives thousands of passports to al-Qaeda
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were arrested in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of the Al-Qaeda organization, among which were also the "Tigers of Liberation of Tamil Eelam" and the "LashTa'i" group.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aiming to ensure that the counterfeiting apparatus of al-Qaida is weakened at the international level by means of “Operation Kampaa” and “thus to limit its operational capabilities”.
Investigators estimate that the cell may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then counterfeited and then shipped to groups that make up the criminal galaxy of the Al-Qaeda organization, so that their “fighters” could travel with impunity across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units were involved in these investigations in addition to Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that in the following days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries, like the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In the context of this operation (when the Pakistanis Junahy Kimayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another one developed in Thailand.
It was these men who controlled from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was dismantled in 2009, mainly stole tourists passports that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men aged 25 to 45, must have been valid for several years and must have been without a marked visa.
The investigative documents stress that no facts are known to link the detainees from Catalonia to the bombing in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was supposed to be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars was sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency, which was "invested" in the purchase of cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", which killed 106 people.
The police have seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) is demanding that Mass stop the fiscal agreement.
The leader of the PPC (People’s Party of Catalonia), Alicia Sánchez-Camach, had the opportunity yesterday to present in person to Arturo Maso her conditions under which she is willing to support his appointment as president of the Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy, while the nationalist wants to renounce the leaders as risky enterprises.
The leader of the Catalan People’s Party came to the meeting with Arthur Mas with the certainty of 18 seats received in the elections last Sunday, which is a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, therefore, the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his appointment to office.
Future alliances that the nationalists in the House would like to maintain when the general elections are held depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but so far the talks that Mas is conducting these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, in order to win her support for taking office, "she will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberation speeches" as well as an economic agreement -- similar to that of the Basque Country -- that the CiU leader even wanted to have voted on in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the overburdened political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mass’s inauguration will be discussed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths did not occur as a result of "lack of action"
Presentations of the Olot center do not exclude that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilma, a carer who - meanwhile employed here - killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
The director of the senior home, Joan Sala, accompanied his lawyer, Joan Canady, and said that "the wish of the home of La Caritat would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "the law and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the reputation that this institution may suffer as a result of not detecting the criminal activities of the caregiver in a timely manner, the great threat to the home of La Caritat is now posed by the demands for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the survivors' families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime occurred in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients of a nursing home with the suspicion that in many cases no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but that – given the age and poor health of the patients – everything was handled by telephone.
La Caritat, through its director, resolutely rejected this extreme yesterday, stressing that "the lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party other than the defendant has committed a misconduct."
The man, now nicknamed "The Angel of Death," confessed to 11 executions yesterday, saying he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed the second elderly woman a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused death by taking too much insulin, unlike the first time he used a mixture of soothing pills.
The director of La Caritat said it was difficult to control staff access to medicines.
In six of the nine cases, insulin and a cocktail sedative were likely the agents used by the caregiver to kill patients in an effort to alleviate their suffering.
But only the analyses now underway in the laboratory should show whether Vila was lying and indeed sought a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by the administration of lye, as he had already admitted in the case of the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat do not believe the medical claims and do not even exclude that the number of killed may be higher than he admitted, and justify their behavior in the various versions submitted by Vila to the court, knowing that he must change his actions when it turned out that he killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to shed light on the full scope of the matter.
The European Central Bank threatens
Investors reacted sharply to yesterday’s threat by European Central Bank President Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The marginal differentials were closed by force and the shares of European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although falling, is recovering – but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It will take some time for investors to lose their fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan for the purchase of the sovereign debt for ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline and to leave unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect liquidity rates to be forecast "at least until March" and to comply with a three-month auction with unlimited access by the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue to pursue their bond purchase programme and even announce its intensification.
If they fail to meet their expectations, they will re-create the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly withdraw their liquidity rates, God be with us!
It was the same at the May convention, where they said they hadn't even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse in the markets -- history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armored fist announced this on Monday and said on Wednesday that it had already bought many, causing further market collapse.
Yesterday's one-year bond auction in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only released 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% from the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting the change in market sentiment that took place after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures representing the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated amounts amount to about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private equity, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after the stress tests did not reveal the problem in July, the amounts are acceptable under the ancillary plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get the approval of the new budget by parliament and it still lacks sufficient support, so uncertainty continues to reign in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has eased the tone of her speech to ease tensions in the face of the next summit meeting of the EU on 14 December, at which a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all on the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the prime minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action that will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment - to the ears of investors it sounds like the Four Seasons since Vivaldi.
The dual effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock exchange rose 4.5%, twice as much as other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the response of the government and the Spanish National Bank has been swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond auction that will be favoured by the Trichet effect, which we hope will be in great demand to help dispel doubts about our refinancing ability.
Asking for a rescue plan would be a self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we do not need - there are 40,000 million in cash available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to markets would close sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Cesar's wife - "not only to be it, but also to seem it".
We're gonna make it.
Eulen Group president attacks Vega Sicilia's children's demands
The storm of open conflict in the Alvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, has not stopped.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the founder of the group, has attacked, after deeming it “completely insignificant”, the legal action of El Enebro planned for the 16th of this month and demanded by five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to enforce their majority and seize with the help of the administrative bodies of the prosecutor’s office of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José set up a legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the company.
The founder of El Enebro, the largest corporate services holding, does not seem willing to relax in his dispute over membership in the ruling bodies of the El Enebro group.
was removed from its administrative committee by five of its seven descendants, who were named forerunners at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year and whose objection is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The hearing of the El Enebro group scheduled for the 16th of this month, convened by the official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the thunder in the womb of the Alvarez family.
Appeal to the judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of the commission until the dispute is resolved.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquirez is seen by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as "a desperate means by his five children to use judicial deceit and a clear legal fraud to reinforce and improve the January 18 negotiations, which were completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this conduct as "completely insignificant".
The protagonists themselves, who remain discreetly silent, have already unsuccessfully tried to convene a hearing in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other activities, controls seven descendants of David Alvarez 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group, however, according to the family protocols, demands the right to use 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when hearing the question of court challenge of the hearing. The date of this hearing has not yet been set.
Red Bull Triumphs in Formula 1 With Siemens’ Secret Weapon
The software suggests improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula One series in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the possibilities of this newly arrived team very seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, everyone was betting on Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari triumph.
Without wanting to diminish the riding abilities of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the power of the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula One - a "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens placed in the hands of Red Bull to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches, which the German company launched in 2007 for the purposes of very remote motorsport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines at production plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision instruments.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
The PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of industrial division at Siemens, explains that the use of this software device has allowed the Red Bull team to carry out modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and tests "within a few hours, in almost real time."
Russwurm says that in 1992, stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements in a single period.
Today, the Red Bull team is working with 180 young, highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology to analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser manufacturing systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical capability is $40 million, representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech race to design and build its racing cars around 50km from London.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visits - especially to journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a “great secret.”
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull in Formula 1 is, without a doubt, fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, behind the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put into its participation in racing circuits, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and yet no one knows them.
Steve Nevey, head of manufacturing technology, said that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to the victory by 50%, and the rest was thanks to the riders.
At present, this ratio has changed and the technology is worth the success of 85%, while the pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to open 20 stores within two years in partnership with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with its business partner Pont Reyes opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
It will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 that the multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrero, vice president of HP Spain, cited as an example the newly rebuilt Gran Vía store in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrera did not want to reveal where other stores would open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrera, who also leads HP’s HR systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same – with the use of local distributors who have the industry’s experience and knowledge.
The North American company advises on the exclusive design of store equipment (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also engaged in the provision of personnel for shops.
Helena Herrerová denied that this would be a franchise, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when shopping, service, after-sales service and even packaging".
The Barcelona store is part of a world-class pilot pioneering program that aims to solve any problems with computer devices in warranty.
The online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we will be able to solve problems that could otherwise take up to two days in 10 minutes."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, since large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service," said Helena Herrerová.
Sabadell wants to steal one million customers from competitors in three years
More optimistic than other bosses, Banco Sabadell’s delegate Jaime Guardiola believes that 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, he expects a reduction in interest rates, which they will try to compensate by lowering bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to win 1 million private clients over the next three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and be able to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with a validity of three years.
The aim is, in addition to surviving without having to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - or 700,000, if those who might leave the bank are deducted - since until now the Institute has rather pampered small and medium-sized businesses and large enterprises than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share in terms of private clients is 3.5%, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or sobriety, to reduce the costs, whose challenges the bank will show when it presents the results for the period.
Few banking institutions at this time dare to set goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
This year, Sabadell will close its Optima program, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the situation in the markets required an extension for a further period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At a meeting held by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "difficult and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be lengthy".
In addition, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while they believe that passive warfare – which reduces margins – is receding, the price of the risk margins that banks and savings banks pay for their issuances to receive liquidity is already shifting to lending prices, thereby offsetting the reduction in margins.
“The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans.”
"We haven't closed the faucet yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network Thursday to reduce long-term loans and raise differential prices – see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now to cut commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but, as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "greater sizes will be required".
"Next year there will be no stone left on the rock," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "significantly reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institution will enter the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can substitute fund-raising on the market before a new capital measure.
After reassuring Sabadell that it can survive the temporary closure of markets, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, it is possible to receive short-term financing using repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA eliminates another wave of savings bank mergers
The CEO of CECA rejected yesterday that there should be another wave of mergers of savings banks, and again insisted on the speed with which the reorganization of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of merging the Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out a new wave of operations.
“I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening are conventions.”
"The majority is fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Aragon Executive and Executive Officials) Olavarrieta described that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the instalments, which at one time, not now, appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank".
“Moving from 45 Savings Banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has never been compared in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that “there are a number of not too happy views on the slowness of the process” that show “a lack of seriousness and understanding” because “what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we have to be on schedule before the end of the year”.
The CEO of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured on Tuesday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and “probably” in the world, and attributed a “lack of knowledge” to those who question it.
The director noted that in the current favorable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks and a system that has mastered the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking has performed very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set conditions for the whole of the Union.
Market tensions have provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediary agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of the AENA (Spanish Airports and Air Traffic Management), the administrator of the airports of Lo Barateria and El Prayas 30%.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
It should be said in advance that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which runs into the idea of respecting old traditions, which is held by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, of which Germany would be part, but also Austria and the Netherlands, for example, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the brand - although now it may seem like a sci-fi, this version has wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to reform the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary rigor, fines for the guilty states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and with the extension of the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for turns now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission spurred deficits in 2009, the German government pulled constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany deemed to be right (plans for fiscal austerity and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel painfully delayed the decision to save Greece.
Already at that time it was the subject of harsh criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has again emerged with a clear position, demanding a reform of the European Union’s conventions so as to allow for the rescue of a Member State and at the same time for private creditors to be obliged to bear part of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat relaxed form, has been approved, and we should follow the Union's reform process in the coming months, which should allow for these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells all of us that, although there is now a need to take measures with which it does not seem to agree very much, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary zone, in which states that violate the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to announce deferrals of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany is telling us that we need to go down a strict growth path with increased savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on receivables and construction, with the huge gaps in the balance of payments that prevailed in the years of Spain’s growth boom, they simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd be making a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
Worst of all, under these conditions, we could be mistaken.
I hope that these current turbulences will take the place of more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this, too, and his double statement (reforms promised after a meeting with big businesses last Saturday and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that despite criticism of Merkel, the way has been opened to the idea that things need to be put in order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it does not seem to want to move.
And from the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not too serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us.
Sport and bypassing the rules
The tricks Alonso and Ramos played against Ajax show ingenuity, not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused a sea of ink to be listed on whether this is unsportsmanlike behaviour and whether UEFA should punish both players.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won), the appointed players deliberately lost time one by one when a foul was about to take place in order to provoke the referee, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending in their group in the lead - and will be able to proceed, deprived of cards, to the next stage.
Eventually, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sentenced Coach José Mourinho to two matches and fined the offenders.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, rules that are unwritten but are followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that Real Madrid (which boasts of generosity and honor in its anthem, and which has already fined its players for similar acts) and, it seems, also due to the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adds another episode to his long history of comedian and provocateur.
in any case, the debate is about whether this type of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether it circumvents the law; indeed, it is an action which respects the rules of sport, the purpose of which, of course, seems to seek to circumvent.
It deals with the type of damage that such actions cause to the sports spirit.
One of the essentials of sports behavior is the physical integrity of the opponents, which in these cases was not violated, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these neat game features is to avoid giving players an advantage over the opposing team due to their misdemeanor – which hasn’t happened here either.
Therefore, the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as deception or circumvention of the law did not happen, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should have been as obvious as possible in order to receive a penalty.
They waited and enjoyed being punished.
Another question, however, is what advantage the guilty will have from their deliberate wrongdoing.
Here it must be stated that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that there is no benefit in the current match, since the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in a future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance the team can be eliminated, and in addition to this, the players will be sentenced, and move to the second round of cards, in which it is enough to exclude one card less than in the first round.
So as the rounds continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that will allow you to get the maximum benefit within the rules.
In the case we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid a penalty (which would be a clear circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between ingenuity and circumvention of the rules is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly ingenuity.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because there were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions to provoke them were transmitted from the leadership.
Damage to sporting principles by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting bids to host Christmas parties in Barcelona
This year, the calendar’s dictate concentrates an avalanche of reservations on December 16 and 17.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid for by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Just like Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December, the pre-Christmas parties are coming again, still acting as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have resulted in a fight to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the businessmen and associations from this sector agree.
To complete the complication of the counts, the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) concentrated applications for the week of December 13, creating an avalanche of peak day reservations (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budget reasons.
In order not to abandon traditions, many employees pay for the expenses at parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices at the limit of capacity, says the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
At the moment, the representative of the patronage of restaurant establishments does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People think twice before they make a reservation."
“They want to get out, but when it comes to the topic of prices, they are careful,” he added.
Shops will do well to those "who offer quality and good service at a reasonable price", he says, recalling that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down the line and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey of various facilities shows that the biggest rush of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group is reporting a real booking boom for this Friday, with most requests being for spending up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30, which they have adapted to offer menus with total prices ranging from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30.
in another major company, Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar of more early bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible and impossible to keep the prices from last year, and our menus, which should be chosen by everyone, range from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and has a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after seeing a rise in profits since the second half of the year and have a fairly solid outlook for Christmas sales.
The company’s sources stress that December 18 will also be a busy day as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations between friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded a tendency of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine).
They also noted that companies are already inviting their employees back, and the size of the groups seems to be a bit larger.
Enric Goma, vice president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona), believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, and claims that the number of reservations has “revived” even though clients “agree to the maximum.”
This impression has not faded even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, he points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program creates unrest in U.S.
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons at a “faster pace than any other country.”
WikiLeaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State published by Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that is arousing in Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details they offer regarding the content of communications and thoughts of the representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "is on the retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other".
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – that its weapons are not assembled but stored piece by piece to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for Washington’s vigilance.
This is calculated by the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report before the visit of the then National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of nuclear material transportation.”
The increased number of people associated with the nuclear arsenals and the missile program is no longer observed only by the United States, but also by Russia, as spreading and presenting a reason to be vigilant.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with a strict religious belief to protect its nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with U.S. counterparts.
The biggest novelty of the documentation published by Julian Assange’s server is the declining cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
A cable issued by the embassy in May that qualifies communications with Pakistan as “frustrating” claims: “Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected.”
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as any other state in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also urged Washington to make it "very clear" during the visit of Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani that "the Pakistani army must end its silent support for terrorist groups."
Chasing the WikiLeaks boss
Obama is appointing a senior counterterrorism official to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a “red call” to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Interpol issued an "extraordinary call" to "locate and track" Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that an Australian faces in Sweden.
Wikileaks co-founder Mark Stephens said: “Police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was November 20, when the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, the 188 countries of Interpol have instructions to identify or locate Assange "with the aim of placing him in temporary detention and extraditing him".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person affected by the red alert, many member states, as the organization explained, consider the so-called red notice to allow the arrest to be made - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially when states have a bilateral agreement on the extradition of detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Ass should be seen.
The move offended Assenge’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder showed a willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, whom they compare to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin’s security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
While the whole world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is defending her son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he does not keep quiet.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine - in this interview, he demanded the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations in violation of international conventions that the United States has signed, she should step down," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation request as "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Traverse, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop putting Assange on the spotlight contrasts with what conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including WikiLeaks among terrorist organizations “so that anyone who contributes financially or otherwise provides assistance to them can be targeted and prosecuted.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said Assange should be “killed” and had to recall him.
"Obama should put a bounty on him or use a drone or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the government, whoever is responsible for the leak has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient," he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "blinking" at Caroda's supporter
The Republican leader will allow the party to secretly vote on his stay.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for fighting an internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC (Republican Left Party of Catalonia), which has been unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his gesture of resignation seems inadequate to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Caroda-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot make him worry as much as he had with other vanished currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to gain new critics by means of a blink of an eye, which will help him to arm himself in the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to secretly speak out about his stay in office.
By means of ballots, not by raising your hand.
If Caroda's supporters want to hand over a punitive vote to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid splitting and subjugating his person.
In several interviews, he argued that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one extra, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
Caroda's supporters demand more from the president than to make his office available - a gesture that they see as meaningless, as Puigcercos controls the largest organ at conventions.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to enforce the resignations, they will try to make an executive resemblance to the plan from now until May.
Therefore, they expect to participate in the preparation of a strategic reorientation document, which will be voted on by the leadership of the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercos in exchange for promising to move the Congress as early as autumn 2011.
The ERC leader said that “multi-voice” is damaging to stability, and that his goal is to make the organization able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, there seems to be a significant article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcercos’ ideologue, this innovation adviser took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed “in exchange for several goals.”
And he named five of them, of which two stand out.
The first is to “recompose” the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which also means to include new faces who are from the sector inclined to Carod.
The second goal can be a big novelty.
Huguet proposes that the ERC completely ends meetings as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates chosen by vote.
The end of the meeting system model, an exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two congresses.
However, a spasmodic assembly in 2008 decided that assembly must be reviewed at a special congress on statute reforms.
This issue is still pending, as the situation within the party has discouraged the issue from being resolved.
Now, without lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to address the issue again and try to close it once and for all.
23 murders in November; 390 in 2010
According to the daily MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the newspaper MILENIO.
Among the murders are the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there were a total of 390 homicides in Mexico, presumably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases, the body was found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, then a gracious blow to the head, and had her hands and feet tied with a rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early Thursday morning, cooperatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualcóyotl, a fifty-year-old man was murdered with eight shots after he left his house to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two 30-year-old victims were shot in the head in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony in Ecatepec district.
In Chalco, on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, the body of a man shot in the forehead was found, and a bullet from a .25-caliber gun was found underneath the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in a sewage channel in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
Rescue personnel searched for other parts but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported a body found with their hands tied to the back and their head wrapped at the site of Pena Colorado.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men, who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza, was reported, and death-threatening reports were also found among the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes La Paz County.
In a nearby colony, a body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the Ixtapaluca district, and the next morning a murdered man was found in Huixquilucan wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, which was provisionally identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report left by the killers near his body.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman was found dead in the San Francisco Acuautla settlement with two wounds to the back of the head.
On the woman's skin were discovered tattoos of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death"), as well as necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, the body of a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found with their heads wrapped in ribbon, and a report was found with them, in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In the case of the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which read: "This will happen to those who do not conform."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found with torture marks and bound limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center in the colony of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the counties of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón, and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape, and had a message left with him; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic wrap in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, the agents found a ticket with a message.
China meets its greenhouse gas reduction target
A representative of the country at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that his country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and specified that it insists on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% in 2020, Su Wei, a representative of the country at the UN climate change conference, said.
In his first public address at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its goals and will continue to work on this issue with the international community.
China’s climate change strategy is divided into four pillars: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and support for pilot programmes.
They have already made progress on all these points, including the adoption last year of a new energy law that includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, he said, various multi-year plans are in progress or have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese government and other governments.
For example, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years, has received investments from the UN, governments and private initiatives.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, followed by a project to replace fluorescent lamps with energy-saving bulbs and a mitigation and adaptation project, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, he described, greenhouse gas emissions per capita are 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use – for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national chairman of the PAN party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party) stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to claim his right from the National Ordinance Commission.
The national chairman of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legal and that the former chairman of that party was entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and claim his right.
In an interview taken before the objection was raised by Governor Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that Espin’s expulsion was in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
“Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the National Council’s Ordinance Commission in his case, so that it is a decision taken by the competent authority,” he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that she was never at the negotiating table for the alliance’s presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held next December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
“This is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was an intention for a local election that was successful and fulfilled its purpose,” he said.
The President of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue are behind him, and therefore "internal competition does not scare us, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us," he added.
He said the committee could, without question, elect the best chairman or chairwoman the PA deserves for the next three years, so he would hand the baton over to "whom the committee appoints".
"So I'm absolutely calm and relaxed, and I'm proud to hand over the office of party chairman to any of those five."
He predicted that the rise the party saw in the last July election would be reflected in future competitions, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances of Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and aspirations are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will meet these expectations".
When asked about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) for his speeches during the four years he has ruled, César Nava urged the members of the PRI to think about the six-year periods of the former presidents, Gorseo Erséa Erséa Erséa Erséa, and the six-year periods of the former presidents.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Claderon, let them start defending them, let them get out of their shells," he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during a speech in the National Auditorium, since there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama Advertises on Twitter to Support Undocumented Students
“If you think the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama today joined a national mobilization to support the Dream Act, which should legalize undocumented students, by posting on his personal Twitter account.
"If you think the Dream Act is the right thing to do, let your senators know and urge them to pass it," Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to a link to a more comprehensive document asking the public to contact senators immediately as the vote on the bill is approaching.
"As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he said.
The report comes after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any bill unless an extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding was approved.
Such a block, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new nuclear non-proliferation treaty with Russia, called START.
Asked about Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to draw up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this issue and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday he would ask for a “vote to close the debate” on the Dream Act, so a motion to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, though it is more likely next week.
The senator’s approval of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country for the past five years, and were admitted to higher education or the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to pass the bill, so they need the help of a few Republicans, so its supporters’ organizations are conducting intense agitation to ensure that the bill is approved.
The Democrats, whose majority supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, expressed that he would vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act need to win several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters negotiate the most are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as resigning Florida senator George Lemieux, who supplemented the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who have said they will not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet spoken.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with literature they put a finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put a finger in the wound" is analogous to the Czech "to hit a nail on the head - note. transcl.)
The second round of the Pleasure of the Language cycle was a promenade, where the participants performed a literary gala performance
"That's what I understand about Sex in the language, but... Sex in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure in the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a theme in the language of the cult.
The finger in the wound "brings us into a tight spot," the Argentine writer spoke affectionately to an audience composed mostly of young people who had gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this round-table debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Marisol Schultz and Luera Rager, Montenzuela.
Luisa Valenzuel read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Schultz then described as a great short story, in which Luisa appeared in the first person as the protagonist, who, in search of knowledge of what the "wound" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not receive any answers.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it will be my wound".
Eventually, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the road, but explained to her that wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents it really open, and that's symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed lightly and came to the conclusion that "she had learned only so much about the wound that it is really open and that it does not exist", but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuela played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also came out with a delightful narrative, which he called The Praise of Invention, in which the finger in the wound is not named, but at some point it appears.
with elements of magical realism tells the story of the famous witch who played the clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or corrected the honesty lost by a virgin, this story, which was then turned to speak America, a great novel in which the novels of the great witches, which from the beginning did not lack his own chronicles, were told by the witches.
“Cervantes, who invented us all, mocked the fake testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in no other way was it ever possible to tell the story of America with such imaginativeness that it lacked even shame.”
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have more imagination" and it is precisely where reality and falsehood converge, where it is no longer known what belongs to one group and what belongs to the other, that fictional literature reaches its peak.
He calls it the “Cervantian tradition.”
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her word Finger in the Wound made possible.
The Cuban-portorian writer has pointed her finger at the great blow of social violence that is going through her country – and shared by Latin America – and is the result of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
“I think good literature, good poetry and good songs close a silent compromise that is obviously not intended,” she said, after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is being created between the author and the reader – and in their “chemical reaction.”
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of the writer bound by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual habits and control of consciousness that overflows with dogmatism, it is forgotten that “behind every no there is a small no and behind every denial there is also a small yes”.
In order to be masters of our thoughts and reality, we must color: and color means many times to put a finger in the wound and bother those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also bother the authorities who prefer this black and white world.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced both good and bad, but he has already managed to achieve on three occasions in the decisive series.
In Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, two different styles, distinguished by their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results, will also collide.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he managed to achieve on three occasions on the decisive series, but until now he left with a loss, which is why this opportunity is special for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stayed one step behind the winner and played quaintly with the same team the next final.
The Santista strategist reached his first Apertura 2002 final as a coach with Morelia, with whom he lost a total of 4-2 to Toluca; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with an overall score of 3-1, which was against Rayados.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario in 2010 he had one third, again against the "Devils" from Toluca, Rubén again suffered a defeat, although his team played against the "Uzená<0xC5><0x99>e" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - note.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, thus being able to celebrate the title for the first time, although he says the institution is the most important for him.
"I don't want to break the stats, this is for the club, for the passion I am committed to, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first is the most important," he said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
in vivid memory has a previous final, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have learned the lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we can not celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run to celebrate, and I think that in this we can not learn about, until the game is over".
He does not worry that this series could be decided in criminal shootings, he believes his players: "You never try to come to a series of criminal kicks, you try to finish at normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be prepared for it, in the last tournament we were ready, unfortunately we were nervous, in the last tournament we were nervous, maybe our fate was nervous, maybe we were nervous.
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the second and to experience the glory that titles bring for the first time.
The United States is changing the rules for issuing visas
People will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centres before interviewing at the Consular Section; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be shortened.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing process at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Service Centres (abbreviated as ASC) before interviewing the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will collect the applicant’s biometric information, which will be evaluated by the Consular Department prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will be no need to pay a fee for arranging a meeting, another for processing the application and another for delivering the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only a single fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Since biometric information will be taken from the ASC, applicants who will require a second appointment with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an additional $26 service fee.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency has called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could be a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce Thursday an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.
Inviting journalists, NASA assured that it would present a "discovery that will cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life", sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and which could represent the possibility that they would one day become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature uses arsenic in some way for its life, and this ability increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere like that on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proved that “there is another, second life form, different from the one we know.”
The space agency will announce the real impact of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with the perspective that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron breed opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary term was not even even started when the opposition bloc was formed in the Congress, led by the deputies of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática, Czech "Partido Democratica Revolución" - note), the PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Partido Laboratorio", the "Partido Laboratorio" - note).
Prior to the opening session of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patron Montalvo were "striking" against the reform of the Constitutional Law by eliminating them.
With this reform, they repeated, “baptism” begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador López Brito from the PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party") and Luis Fórdenas in the post.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms institutionally form a political marginality at the instigation of the parties PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they will talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme based on political will, and if they do not have it, they will again be subjected to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"Once it's here [the opposition coalition], I'm looking at it because we're excluded from any decision, they're not even willing to consider the opinions of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of the Convergence party said that they agree with PRD, PT and Patrón and therefore will form a pluralist group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after being a monopoly, should now be a "dualist".
The aspiration of the reform of the law is not that there should be an endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT party explained that at the moment Congress has become a "loot" of two - in reference to the parties PAN and PRI.
"It used to be ruled by only one side, now it's divided by two."
Patron Montalvo demanded that the personality of the Member be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"In order for the five of us, who are probably nine, but now see us in five, not to stay out because of the arched agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have formed and agreed on, we stand out and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200,000 pesos are being issued for the "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another check to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by the city hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
The amount paid in the second half of this year to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material will rise to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the City Hall, this last check, number 9258447, was sent on November 16 of this year, was issued for the amount of 200,144,56 pesos and as its subject was stated "the settlement of unpaid payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this contractor, who was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices, an additional amount.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many checks will still be sent to Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers, is being paid," he said in an interview.
The last checks "re-appeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last on November 16.
Although this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies inspected by the Supreme State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative bodies, the treasurer assured that she did not use the services of the contractor of the city hall again.
previously, after 25 July, the daily Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
She also carried out transactions with Jumapa, where she collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites urgently need maintenance
Tourist managers are complaining about the accident of a foreign tourist because of the poor condition of Sánchez Taboada’s pavilion in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into a depression in the pavilion of Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, not showing the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraz Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination to be taken care of, and the bad that tourists find there to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk here and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea about the revenues that are leaking, otherwise they wouldn’t have been dealing with these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city hall.
"The workshop will have to take responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again, it will have to focus on preventive maintenance, not just fixing existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, after all, even as residents we deserve a clean dwelling, the city hall should change its strategy for maintaining the city."
There are other places that look neglected and miserable, he noted, such as the Emblem of Mazatlán and El Venadito (monument, statue of a deer).
"Today, in order for tourists to come, it is not only about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city rich in the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no attention to this and these facts highlight something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the city hall, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive, because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary of the Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces that will need to be put in order first to make these places more attractive and to put them on the list we have for the promotion of this destination.”
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, would like MEPs to take great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period of full decent work and no agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanded by the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is convulsing and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term has begun, consisting of seven political forces, 19 MPs from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia and the last from the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from new members of Congress is that they will be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same partisan and paternalist patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordination Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress should take great responsibility and set an example on the road to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
“We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
Therefore, he spoke about the need to reaffirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that would move the ruling ones forward in order.
“We want them to do decent work and above all be committed to society and sectors, because it was the Sinaloa people who gave them their vote of confidence in the last election.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the hotel association Tres Islas, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives would be to pull together all forces in an effort to achieve the country’s economic growth, as the current economic situation is very difficult.
Most importantly, they stimulate economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way support job creation.”
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give it more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currencies and investment, which, moreover, directly competes with agriculture."
In addition to spending money on start-up tourism projects, Congress should help provide the state with security and help with an alcohol law that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary terms.
Looking for three kings
Dolls, cars and bicycles are, along with other toys, on the wish list of the children in the Coronada Valenzuel family.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their visions on the upcoming Feast of the Three Kings, since their household consists of exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions because the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband is unlucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the 'plebs' on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for 10-year-old José Alfredo, he would have wanted a monster car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would have wanted clothes in the size of a year.
"He told me [José Alfredo] 'I wish I had this monster car', but I said 'we'll see son' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalls with sadness.
For older children who were just at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is a size 12, 10-year-old Isaías is a size 10, while 8-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so he could really use a pair of five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronada Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Searching for Three Kings", and at the reception of the newspaper Noroeste bring a gift or cash.
14 suspected drug traffickers who were arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
Tours took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in locations used to make drugs.
“Approximately 750 beds of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used to produce it were seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both suspected heads of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested had to be brought to the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, possessing it for the purpose of trading in it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections followed a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was information that we received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the regional investigation unit of the city of Ester by the Quebec State Police, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Police Administration Memphrémagog.
Illegal immigration can continue without any problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will apparently be defeated, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand upright on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a week-long session of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as it is proposed, a law that would allow detention for up to one year for any person coming from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was heading towards the wrong goal.
"We are against it, and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government does," Duceppe said.
Critic of the NPD on immigration issues, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“The neo-Democrats agree that we take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants, and that’s what we consider to be the backbone of another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and puts children in jail for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney blamed the opposition parties.
“Canadians are telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that are targeting Canada and treating it like some kind of lick.”
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Kenney said.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could lead the country to an election leading to its rejection.
One Conservative told QMI that the government would ask for a vote so that any MP who opposes it would be held accountable for their stance to their voters.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and anti-collusion unit, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying not to forget this idea: Quebec intends to discuss this issue with the Department of Investigation in New York as early as January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That’s why Tuesday’s announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil himself.
More was not needed for PQ’s public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to rate the announcement as “a rabbit pulled out of a hat” and “an amateur solution fed up on the knee.”
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They will be satisfied with the confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of the problem."
For the president of CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace setting up an interrogation of witnesses at a public hearing.
"Moreover, Mr. Charest insists he doesn't want to set up this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of an investigative commission is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Higher Officials.
To get out of this impasse, he suggested that Quebec grant a special mandate to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the Inspector General's mandate," he said.
It also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the files of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to make it better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the Marteau Operations Commissioner, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Secretary of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is just dealing with some of the amendments associated with this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several watercourses have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road is bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 additional millimeters were not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The stretches in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
A total of 100 millimeters could fall there.
Adding these precipitations to the melting snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be concerned about flooding in some watercourses.
Quebec's emergency services issued a flood warning for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière on Wednesday evening.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides forest, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood alert and continuous control.
In the de Lanaudière area, heavy rainfall caused the watershed of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the spill of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Emergency services are on alert and overseeing the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Center issued a flood warning Wednesday for several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially embarrassed
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as rude language during broadcasts.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and inappropriate negative depictions of Haitians of gross language that does not correspond to broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that discussions on suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two people who took their own lives, did not infringe the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council has received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasting, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Social Support Beneficiaries Common Front.
The group complained that the amounts shown in the broadcasts were inaccurate.
Moderators must submit reliable information, not false.
Regarding suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the message conveyed was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission considers that the contested episodes of the Dupont Noon News came across a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no reproach against him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then engaged in a media shootout that sparked many reactions.
The moderator of CHOI said that he did not send any donation to help the Haitians, because we cannot be sure that those in need will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already made up for my three-day delay."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use rough language in broadcasting.
In any case, CHOI-FM radio broadcasts cooperated "above and beyond their duties".
For a station which, inter alia, will have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of the kung fu of Montreal.
Nacereddine Zemmal, an Algerian native of Montreal, has an extremely special background.
An athlete who excels in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing enters tatami and rings all over the world looking for new challenges.
“I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria,” Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals, explained.
“In my case, I’m looking for matches a little bit everywhere, because for those who don’t like the game on the ground that appears in martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, this security guard and UPS assistant just gave bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburgo, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I'm currently preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The opponents who finished in the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007 in China, I finished in the tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating from China, where punches and kicks, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of fighting, is an American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal has only one goal in his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the "King of Sanda", the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explains the sympathetic guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Stade Lumpinee."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first game, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, analyzing."
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete so that one champion, the king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracted without public tenders
Hydro-Québec agreed to 450 million in contracts with engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium made up of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has won the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project totaling $295 million without a public tender.
This consortium, on behalf of Énergie gérance, was mandated in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for the management of this major hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" received a lucrative contract without any public tender.
For the Quebec Party, a complaint against a consortium of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and triggering price increases.
"It's a new way to implement the collusion and eliminate the competition."
“This means that people no longer make side deals secretly, they are already doing them openly today,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
A little earlier in the morning, M. Simard posed this question to the National Assembly because he says it is hard for him to bear how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon, emphatically denying that this contract was a collusion.
"I have my own way," she thundered, arguing that PQ was "dishonest" and "lacking in accuracy."
She said "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice all over the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that will allow two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex given the scope of the work.
Construction is underway and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without competition being able to act; it was trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of engineering consultancy consortia is the subject of a government investigation.
If we quickly cross the Quebec business register, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been formed permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; citing CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to the same legal entity, which is Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the area of la Baie James is characterised by a special workforce dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been reacting to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will force us to bend our foreheads over the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and there are few bidders, your bids may be higher."
"You have two choices: that is, you take the people who appear in the contract as contestants, and that you say, 'Let's make a deal satisfactory and at a good price.'
"But the main idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr. Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of more than $50,000 contracts received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consulting contracts, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with firms or their branches, especially with laboratories performing soil sample analysis.
SNC-Lavalin took 22 contracts, of which Genivar acquired 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in "Energy Gérance".
All contracts have been concluded.
They total $449,783,344, including a contract with Énergie gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well-known Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance" it, before specifying that they are more of its executives.
Responsible consumption barometer - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in "impartial" brands and environmental certifications, to be guided accordingly in the selection of products.
Worst of all, even as we bathe in a media universe that urges and urges us to consume more socially responsible, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, a failure to fulfill obligations that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, according to the Baromètre of Responsible Consumption, whose first article was published yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them still do not trust them very much.
In fact, two-thirds of us say we don’t trust company promises about the environment, simply because green advertising by companies, finds a measurement tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: Half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labeled as environmentally responsible.
In the same way, politicians’ debate on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
Information on responsible consumption, however, seems to be paramount in stimulating this side of consumption, revived at present by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, a vacuum and dubious nature of information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebec’s residents are suspicious of the product or “green” services we are looking for to let pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular to change the brand of one or more products in response to their beliefs.
As many as 61% of them preferred shopping with merchants in their neighborhood and preferred buying food grown in their region, Baromètre said.
More “green” and responsible – the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year – the Homo consumus Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, striving to have the least impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, Baromètre says: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they used public transport or recommended using the car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
Walking and biking was also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The government of Quebec, which we have asked for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallele, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The developer company Angus et le Parallèle, which sought a donation of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard, and which proved its mission as a film lover, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the government of Quebec is proposing a loan, the amount of which would otherwise be lower, was some initial expectations, which could lay the foundation for a viable solution on favorable terms and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and the 12.8 million request were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and the plan of action were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counterproposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallele et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinema Centres in Quebec opposed direct investment by the state in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture should not finance the real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the other hand, several participants in the debate demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his cinemas during the ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which may have been the reason for the change on the part of the state's financial council.
The lack of independent film halls is striking in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to gain a steady clientele.
Angus et le Parallele, with Christian Yaccarini at its helm, is running a campaign to unleash funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will earn $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and screen Xavier Beauvois’ most beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini hasn’t mentioned Le Devoir, and so he and his group are ignored, thinking about the reduction proposals that are being made to him.
The Rising Curtain on Canada as a whole...
New US diplomatic sources known via WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of Canadians’ inferiority towards Americans, but with the same blow they reveal their sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is concerned about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote, and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government to pass its 2009 budget!
Four new reports between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were unveiled yesterday, provide sensitive details to get each other under the skin.
The communication, dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by political leaders.
To the great amazement of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
“The Canadian inferiority complex, almost fixed, conditionals perhaps political leaders to talk about internal betting instead of realizing that this election also applies to the United States (as in the free trade campaign in 1988),” he writes.
"The United States is, therefore," he concluded, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to be talked about."
The ambassador understands this “deafening silence” all the less as both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party, or even better, the head of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls.”
Another expression of this sense of importance can be found in a message sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your journey will help ensure the preservation of the government in a confidence vote in early February regarding the federal budget to which Canada will publicly allocate its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30-40 billion recovery plan,” Breese writes.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas sessions of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition, and that the opposition parties condition their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington's attention to the increasingly negative picture being thrown at the United States by drama series broadcast on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which include not very ingenious references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purpose of forcible interrogation at the CIA.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take in some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it reads, “he handed over some paper relating to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, to the Secretary of State.”
"Mystery accepted with the fact that it will revise the file."
Finally, let us note that the people concerned by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, told CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “destroyed.”
It went public and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Lighting Renewal Plan
The United Nations has proposed a plan in Cancun to restore home, shop and industrial lighting in 100 countries with the aim of achieving greenhouse gas (GES) reductions, which correspond to almost one-third of the additional limit to be achieved to stabilize the planet’s climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to implement in Cancún to compensate for the lack of difficult-to-implement reduction commitments on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if we replace the incandescent bulbs that monopolize another 50 to 70% of the market with fluocompact bulbs or, even better, bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a significant amount of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet generated due to lighting would be decommissioned.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s the equivalent of 70% of the world’s car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, joined voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GES emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance to achieve by 2020 the stabilization of the climate warming at 2 degrees Celsius to be able to exclude that it will not get out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat, and the rest, i.e. 5%, is a product of light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs introduced this week by Philips — the company reportedly participated in a UN study — have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving us an idea of possible savings with a replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact lamps because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless producers set up collection centres.
However, the report states that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact incandescent bulb, but rather thermal coal power plants, which emit much of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these headquarters put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation annually.
The report also details the profits that each country would make from this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year on the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the election results.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the presidential election in Côte d’Ivoire to be published immediately after the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent election commission to complete its work and announce the preliminary results without delay," a spokesman for the U.N. president said.
“It asks all parties in Côte d’Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.”
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the election commission allowed the latest date – midnight on Wednesday – to expire without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s scrutinium.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the CEI president confirmed on television that the commission was “continuing its work” to be able to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls around the world for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassane Ouattara, were multiplied.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the annulment by the Constitutional Council for “fraudulent” voting in the north, which has been administered by former New Army (FN) rebels since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the maneuvers of voter intimidation practised by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country discouraged supporters of the president of Côte d'Ivoire from going to vote.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council took into account Gbagbo’s complaints.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country’s Supreme Court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection with the former rebels, denounced the delay in reporting the results as “unacceptable” and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the election commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of the presidential election, held on Sunday, was seen as the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political faction on Wednesday that it could be held accountable for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, October 31, as the winner with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who won the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédie (25% in the first round).
Unemployment remains stable in France in the third quarter.
France's unemployment rate in the sense of the word, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), according to provisional data with seasonal variation correction (CVS), published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has stabilized at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
The second quarter data was confirmed for 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are not working in the third quarter but would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to be able to work, and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of today’s young people in the labour market was further aggravated with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people were unemployed between the ages of 15 and 24.
As for seniors, they saw a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is, 482,000 people over 50 years of age and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 years benefited from unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
The Insee no longer publishes its monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini has been charged and detained.
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS Board of Directors of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement, allegedly fraudulently acquired.
Alexandre Guerini was charged with misappropriation of company property, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, bribery, accepting bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is militant and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions that the judge is going to ask him, and not any delusions."
“It’s easy to prosecute him for a number of convicting reasons, but it’s another thing to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini stated, through his lawyers, that he had sent a brief statement to the judge before his hearing in order to clarify everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
When it comes to the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds linked to their functioning, he never knew anything about it, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of services of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was charged on Wednesday with misuse of public funds and plots, and left the protagonist of the whole matter at large, under judicial supervision with a ban on socializing.
"My client has been able to provide an explanation of all the facts charged against him."
"The investigating judge takes this into account and lets him go free," Yann Arnoux, his lawyer, said in a statement.
Four other people were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial supervision, Attorney General Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption.
Two officials from the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been charged, one for "stealing and misappropriating the property of the company", the other for "complotting the misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guerini’s business associate, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with “hiding the misuse of the company’s assets.”
Among the persons confronted by Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company of helping to launder money from widespread gangsterism.
The investigation is being conducted in the framework of several open court investigations against X in April 2009, following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses mainly on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the Marseille Municipality (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss Case: Elysée Palace Exaggerated Syria Mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for “espionage,” united views in France, put diplomacy on combat alert, and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this is closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
U.S. documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the downsides of the crisis.
They describe how the Élysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostages in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakaand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the U.S. justice system for fraudulent material trafficking in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they shed light on the way the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
He didn't really do anything for it.
A diplomatic telegram signed on August 12, 2009 in Paris is headlined: "Iran: French Comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, a strategic adviser at the Élysée Palace, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Quai d’Orsay’s director for North Africa and the Middle East, speaks with Allegrone, a representative of US diplomacy.
Explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do just as much for him to be taken back to his homeland by their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "constantly pronounce the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation" in the media.
The Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, needs to be brought into trouble.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop."
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, "nothing will solve the silence", the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is an “Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of “political blackmail”.
She announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day the French embassy gives her refuge) "will require the payment of a large financial sum to the Iranians" (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>230,000 bail).
And they'll announce that the Elysée Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will escalate."
The Iranians could “arrest about 1,800 more French people living in Iran in the future,” he said.
August 28, 2009
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but she remains blocked in Iran.
Information spreads: Iranian Majid Kakaand, who the United States claims to have been expelled for illegally trading electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, is inquiring about this worrying consensus.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to acquire material for its nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavanda is bad news.
Has France agreed to a deal?
The liberation of the Iranians for the liberation of the young Frenchwoman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Élysée Palace, he said, was not only "surprised by the judge's decision," but was looking for ways to counter it.
"There were talks between the presidential office and the minister of justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court", he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakaand is under the "limited" supervision of French intelligence.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up the phone, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Parisian buildings administered by the Iranian embassy.
At the time of the imprisonment of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through a communique and organized "escapes" to the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad is playing a "significant" and "influenced" role as a "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation bears its fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes the media "brightness" of French officials.
What is the basis of such a degree of "gratitude" expressed towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their statements full of praiseworthy French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysee Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intense communication “directs towards the validation of President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he analyzes.
The policy followed in 2008 has been "observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and labeled premature and undeserved".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can earn by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"At least that should create confusion and confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Élysée Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called “Pecivalsky” that will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to the games after midnight for people under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family said.
“Many children play these games all night and then have learning difficulties at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, a senior official at the ministry in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make free programs available to people who request it, allowing them to limit their time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily newspaper regularly presents various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA establishes host countries.
Full of unrest over suspicions of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee sets up the 2018 and 2022 World Cup host country on Thursday, a choice supremely politically motivated where power struggles and lobbying risk outperforming technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the 2018 FIFA Royal Competition will be held in Europe, the traditional tower of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 World Championships will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after premiering on the African continent in 2010 or continue to set in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who will participate in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of the economic and political world.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations run the risk of lasting until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy by candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documentations contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time set aside for voting.
At the beginning of the revelation leading to the suspension of two members of the CE (European Commission?) on corruption (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) may have ruined the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which so far has hosted the World Cup only once a year.
The BBC put the crown on Monday when it aired a documentary that "stitched on the pin" of three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa dissatisfied and bring English leaders into trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the move made by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who won the London 2012 Olympics in 2005.
Will this intensive activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spanish-Portuguese couple does not lack the triumphs of the already prepared stadiums, his benediction (the 1982 World Championship in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial prospects of both countries could give those ambitions a cold shower.
Possible retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly declared “unfair competition in the preparation of the vote”, in allusions barely twisted to accusing the English press of CE (European Commission) members.
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," Mr. Poutin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorite with its considerable experience from 1994.
The world’s highest-performance economy, the headquarters of FIFA’s main sponsors, appears to be well ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have crafted a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for both countries, which together underwent a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the 2026 World Cup award to China, which FIFA ardently desires, has rendered Asia’s chances for 2022 void.
With Qatar pulling a big ace out of its sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new landscapes, but the two countries pose more risks than security.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for the meager TV fees (due to time shifts) paid by European countries, which are a driving force for FIFA.
Second mandate: Obviousness (certainty)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand made it seem hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysée Palace calls someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of secrecy associated with the presidency.
Therefore, it is necessary to act as if the doubts persist.
In one sense and in another.
In 2006, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term should not be excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured with a serious expression that "it will be decided sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As he reminded the members of the UMP parliament on Wednesday evening at the Élysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown little fever.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was a statement on his part, not a statement.
This is not the first time that he has used the humorous tone of the presidential election in such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you have seven and a half years with me to go," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His statements of the day before yesterday will not make him a candidate any more than the day before; nor will they make him a candidate any less.
If they make comments, it's because of the double truth.
Acceleration of the path to the candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolène Royal's pitch that's pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS want an arrangement in combat formations more premature than intended.
Poor research on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and we are not discussing this issue with the UMP," the prime minister's immediate and cautious people responded.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, aligned with the obvious.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council in the year was supposed to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for withdrawal from the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The sovereign European debt crisis is binding, and the Securities Issuance Institute will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the already tense situation in the European securities markets.
In this case, the political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central Bank of Europe in the resolution of the receivables of European states.
She did not want to say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example, by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...) ".
The evening before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, the President of the Central Bank of Europe, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more eloquent about his intentions, and was satisfied with the fact that he stated that the program of purchase of state titles in the secondary market "continues" and that the session "continues" as we see it.
The only certainty: The Central Bank of Europe will keep its basic interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, treasury bond purchases by the European Central Bank have doubled to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion in the past week.
And thanks to the market’s foolishness, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market participants that the anticipation of the continuation of purchases does not exist (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change in course.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, the latter shall proceed to the unrestricted provision of liquidity on generous terms and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her agenda in a significant way."
“If not, it would mean taking the risk of creating a short-term new tension,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
“A progressive outlook announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” predicts Norbert Brams, economist at Sal.
- Oppenheim.
To the plan for its interventions in the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the exposures of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, he has no choice but to maintain his presence in the market.
“It needs to compensate for the shortage of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the flare-up of paid performance by the countries that are among the most fragile,” a prominent bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates rise, countries will be all the more anxious to reduce their debt rather than stabilize it.
It is saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government backs up
After the start of the week for Italy worrisome, the situation has relaxed a little, yesterday with the reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to Temporary Calm.
At the end of the meeting with the minister for the economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti classifying the situation as "unresolvable" and expecting an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denounced.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest rates reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of CDS went up to 263 points, causing some turmoil in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with "the turbulent development of markets" and a possible contagion originating in Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and vague fiscal inputs, which go hand in hand and put the state at risk of not being able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecast for Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and at 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the general government deficit will still account for 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7 billion addendum to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
For now, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's Governing Board, assured under Italy's pressure on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization effort required in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and after that, elections scheduled for the end of March could begin to be organised.
This would usher in a period of time that would be inadequate for a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think Europeans have demonstrated this all day and all night on Sunday, they are clearly very solidary, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday’s expansion of interest on European government bonds has brought water to the mill to governments and the Central Bank of Europe.
But we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
Standard & Poor's said it could degrade Portugal's debt record, a target most targeted by speculation.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and obvious policy, based mainly on banking systems," said economists Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is slower than market time.”
Aware of this disconnected context and the dangers it entails, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most affected by the problem, and on a broader scale with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
This is in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin group from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank is held today.
The agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, blocked a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday, in order to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the aim of this journey to increase funds, it certainly paves the way for achieving this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in the funds raised through additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that add to strict measures with quick effect.
Lisbon and Madrid took a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international assistance at all costs, even before applying their own budgetary adjustments and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the process of normalization of sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take stock of securities again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is the actor in the very first plan to trade in European sovereign debt, believe that an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be enough, “preferably” in the form of direct financial liquidity.
The means exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised to date by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A Council that has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are deteriorating.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange emergency.
Snow rations are still causing traffic difficulties, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activity.
Twenty-four counties are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres et la Vienne, joined the 20 districts that already have a declared orange alert, 18 as early as Wednesday afternoon, and two, la Dordogne et la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowstorms are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and the Les Charentes, and there is little snowfall on the Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowstorms are large enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activity, according to France’s Meteo.
On the coast of the Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned heavy goods traffic - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police, and police recommend that you drive your vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Picardy, school connections were banned on Thursday.
No special measures to restrict freight traffic are foreseen on Wednesday evening.
The District Office "calls on all car drivers to be as cautious as possible on the roads and to adapt driving to the nature of the road".
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris’ Roissy Airport and 10% to Orly due to expected snowstorms.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick airports in southern London and Edinburgh airports in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernising transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we recall the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start the construction, the state announced a grant of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
Purely in theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of its dual source of funding for contracts.
Today we come to the first additions.
The Rectification Act of 2010 on Finance, which is being examined by the National Assembly’s Finance Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we will read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is quantified: "The yield of this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists "to modernise it in order to increase the revenue generated by it and to affect the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that make?
A mirage.
This is not listed in the text.
We're far from four billion.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are being added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of capital subsidy that will be mobilized by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
At SGP, this system does not seem shocking to us.
"From the moment we generate revenue (both taxes, NDLR), we can cover the studies for three years and then go up to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed."
SGP believes that 4 billion will be credited only in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billions promised belong to the still absent subscribers, risks sparking a somewhat hectic parliamentary debate.
The first public hearing will be on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and hardworking spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is uncovered, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates the future controlled by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the Secret Service (of any nation) consists entirely of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelations" of Americans about Berlusconi's sexual life are announcing what for months everyone could read in any newspaper (all but these two Berlusconi own), and the notorious cartoon profile of Gaddafi has long been a subject for sketch cabaret artists.
The rule that secret documents can only consist of messages already known is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore that deals with esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of occult texts does not like to look for new information (or even know where to look for reports about the non-existent), but because those who are engaged in occultism believe only what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited in spirit) head of the secret services (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, the editor of the newspaper Libération) who only considers what he admits to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy sent to the State Department was the same information that Newsweek had published a week earlier.
So why was there so much fuss about the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely, that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War and since the time when heads of state can call each other or fly off to dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have transformed into espionage centers.
Any viewer watching films about the investigation knows very well that it is only out of hypocrisy that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly blasphemes the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain top-secret information from the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not negligible, to the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and its "executors".
But let's move on from here to the deep truth of what happened.
Once upon a time, in the days of Orwell, it was possible to contain all power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orwell’s prophecy has been proven ever since, thanks to the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway used, and so on, the citizen became a total victim of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now,that even "tombs" with the most secret information of the powerful can not resist the intervention of some hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker—elected as the avenger of the citizen—can know all the secrets of power.
How can he keep a power that can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the real secret is an unsubstantiated secret (and an unsubstantiated secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious unsubstantiated secret, because it is extracted from public life; but to reveal all secrets was, as it was to him by Hillary, a secret without Cleopatra.
WikiLeaks did not make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this blow of the bestowal of the Power be so significant?
It is clear that in the future, states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be the equivalent of posting it on a poster on a street corner.
But it’s also quite obvious that with current technology, it’s useless to hope that you can keep a message confidential over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept confidential in the future?
I know my prognosis is science fiction at the moment, so it's fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials transporting themselves discreetly fulfilling formalities along uncontrollable routes, carrying only those messages that they know by heart, or rather hide rare information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in key-sealed drawers: overall, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated wire-based telegraph.
Videotapes (analogues) allowed cinema lovers to shoot a movie step by step, moving it forward and backwards and uncovering all the secrets of assembly, whereas now CDs (digital) only allow you to jump through chapters, that is, macro portions.
By high-speed trains, we reach Milan in three hours, while it takes three and a half hours to travel by plane and transport.
It is not unusual, therefore, that politics and communication technologies will return to horse-drawn chariots.
One final comment.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was being set up in the secret of the embassy.
Now it is embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test the promises of fast-start or early-start funding made by developed countries.
And the great French hacks have been exposed
Under the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU drew a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: a report detailing the actions of its member states, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operation invaluable and valued for its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that it released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track to deliver on its promise of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as the reference year: international funding has been maintained and it is adding 150 million to it for three years of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of public development aid.
France, on the other hand, considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of Public Development Aid d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease), to comply with its commitment regarding the financing of "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses his own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed is equal to 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to reducing emissions, consisting in more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not understand it as the equivalent of our commitments, but as the price of the loan (the rate of the loan to the country).
But France can only provide such a justification: it "complies" with its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91.5% is a loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the European Union to use a loan on such a scale.
Germany demanded 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) complied with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union gives 1 euro to fulfill its promise, France will give only 10 centimes and considers this effort comparable.
What a lovely piece of cake!
To sum up, in its "fast start" financing, France operates with a double swindle: on the one hand, with the development of the stock over time and, on the other hand, with a real financial burden.
Although it spends only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, it can convince that it is spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that even though it was Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why should Member States continue to donate when all they need to do is borrow?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not entirely naive...
The chapter on early funding is only a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to draw on the lessons learned from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounts for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of fairness and fairness towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussing long-term financing deposits (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): we will not avoid the issue of "additionality" or the way in which loans are recorded.
France should change its stance to become as progressive with these deposits as it is with the others.
So everyone is putting their hopes in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who is coming to Cancun next week.
The surprise announcement of France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans could spark an increase in the level of international trust necessary to move forward in the discussions.
Alarm about pesticides that children will eat.
A ten-year-old child will one day consume 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex- Movement for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the processed issue", bought between July and September food commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for one child of about a decade in supermarkets in Paris.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as confectionery, have been analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five are clear carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptors to internally excreted (PE) glands, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
“Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we see well in our research that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking.”
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain in themselves about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
An apple imported from Brazil, cited in studies as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, for which studies have found traces of potent insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steak, canned tuna, and even bun and chewing gum were sprinkled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave oven did not escape the analysis.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this "cocktail of contaminants" is likely to be underestimated, according to the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greens Association (EE-LV) has proposed "in the face of an emergency" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "growth of civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
