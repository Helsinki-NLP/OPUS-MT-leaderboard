Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called Muppets
Some Members of the National Assembly were dismayed, as a result of a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea arose in connection with the plans to rename the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the object of mockery.
A Labour MP expressed his group's concerns, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, the word “twp” means stupid, and the word “pwp” means feces.
One of the politicians of the party Plaid Cymru said that his group is "dissatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was "open" to changing its name, but noted that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
The committee currently working on a bill to change the name of the Assembly took the following position: “Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the members of the Assembly will be theirs”.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposal. The renaming of the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament received broad support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", i.e. WMP in English, although the abbreviation "MWP" was the most popular among the public.
Members of the assembly propose alternative solutions. Difficulties in reaching a consensus are a nuisance for Elin Jones, the president of the assembly, who should present a draft law in the coming weeks.
The law introducing the reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules for dismissal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the debate.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be known as the Republic of North Macedonia.
A popular vote is expected to help resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which is home to a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed the country’s attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
<0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov, the president of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change is necessary to allow the country to join the European Union and NATO.
Bells in New York's St. Martin's Church Shut Down Over Troubled Churches in Harlem
“The older people I talk to say that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
“Now there is no trace of them.”
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Currently, people are socializing in a different way,” he said.
“Bars have ceased to be a regular meeting place for members of the community.”
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property are not enough for as long as the decision-makers believe, and that “sooner or later they will be at the starting point”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support other nearby temples.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be white. This will accelerate the complete closure of churches, as it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by a congregation of white believers before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Martin joined the community a decade later).
The original assembly of white Methodists left the district in the 1930s.
A nearby assembly of African-Americans took over the ownership of the building at the time.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by an assembly led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street vendors (Harlem's main shopping street) opposing the hiring or promotion of African Americans.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but the parishioners of John Howard Johnson made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell complex.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the new carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who knocked the bells in July, described them in a different way, as "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world to be supported by a black musician. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to Riverside Church, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace it.
In recent months, a number of complicated events have taken place in the church of St. Martin with the participation of architects and performers. Some of them were brought to the place by lay leaders of the church, and some by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish composed of secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that it "wants to shift the costs to the council", although the council did not take part in hiring architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Scuba Diving in California
Authorities reported that last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old scuba diver in California. The event occurred on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the U.S. city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a cry for help. Immediately, with a group of friends, they swam to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was excited to catch a lobster, but soon he realized that the child was screaming: “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
Upon arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin in the area of the collarbone.
“I started shouting to everyone to run out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego. His condition was determined to be critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
At a press conference, rescuer Captain Larry Giles said the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it had been deemed not to be a dangerous shark.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper torso.
For the purpose of the investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed the access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad, all the way to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand its operations in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is throwing gloves at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing supermarkets with department store-style beauty departments, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK cosmetics market – which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is growing steadily despite declines in the fashion industry and household goods – 11 stores belonging to the chain will have larger shelves with cosmetic products. If successful, the initiative will be expanded to more points next year.
The return to the cosmetics industry comes from the search for ways to develop the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
According to Sainsbury's, the chain will double the number of cosmetic products and offer up to 3,000 items. The assortment will include products from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also receive more space and separate areas close to those known even from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket chain plans to refresh its range of makeup products Boutique. From now on, most of the articles will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will create test points at two Sainsbury’s supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will be set up in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the chain tries to combat discounters like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products other than groceries.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos points in hundreds of stores and is introducing a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this has contributed to increased food sales and increased investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize the departments of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals was a failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's set up a joint venture with Boots, but the partnership ended after a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in supermarkets.
Sainsbury’s is rolling out a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
Lloyds reportedly will contribute to the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores in the chain.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of the cosmetics department to improve customer experience.
We have invested in special training for co-workers so they can help consumers while shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and the friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the current ways of making purchases. "
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den television show, was "furious" when he learned that Holly Willoughby was going to pull out of the <0xC2><0xA3>11m lifestyle brand to focus on the newly established partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items under the name Truly.
The business has often been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, the 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave the thriving lifestyle brand and focus on the newly established collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV by Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den program.
According to the sources, Peter Jones was “angry” when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, he would not have time to devote himself to their brand offering accessories and household items.
The company had previously been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and was also expected to double the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million estate of Holly Willoughby.
After the announcement of the decision to leave the Truly brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK for one of his holiday homes.
As the source reports, “The Truly brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future to it and wanted to take care of it for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the business completely surprised all the people involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was already so close to entering the market.
In the Warehouse in Marlow, the goods are in arrears, ready for sale."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of the This Morning program and one of the most successful stars in the UK could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – covering products from pillows to candles to clothing and household items – as well as further delaying entry into the market.
It can also mean the end of a long-lasting friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three) and her husband, Dan Baldwin, maintained a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp co-founded the Truly brand in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as CEO.
The couple spent vacations together, and Jones held a 40% stake in Dan Baldwin's television production company.
Holly Willoughby is set to become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked about the criticism of the media caused by the remarks, which some deemed “not fit for the man of state”, as well as a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, posing as a TV presenter:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
The president noted that Kim Jong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been delayed.
MOSCOW (Reuters) - More than three months after a summit in Singapore in June, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that he sees no “analogous response” from the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
He noted that instead, the United States maintains sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un have had positive results: they have led to the end of the missile tests, helped free the hostages and returned the remaining US troops home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim Jong Un.
"It's easy to behave like a president. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get into a crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd gathered directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over their heads by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities did not declare a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating the international aid efforts.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support, so the situation is difficult,” said Selina Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is unclear whether international staff will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if aid from international organizations should be allowed.
In the face of the shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh province in the event of a tsunami, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu – despite the warning being issued – likely had an impact on the death toll.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is heading to the city of Palu to help the victims of the earthquake, but it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure a focal point of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds for roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year’s elections, the presidential administration is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo found himself under pressure due to the persistence of religious tensions in the country. Members of the majority Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people have been killed and tens of thousands have lost their homes as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows and other simple weapons in the streets.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a goal in a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring a goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at a distance of about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal at 1:0 against his team.
Before giving the shot in the direction of the distant goal, he transferred the ball to his left foot.
The ball moved high above the penalty area towards the upper right corner of the grid.
Then he flew into the gate and flew over Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I was just trying to take my position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to take it as far forward as possible. I wanted to give myself the best opportunity to shoot,” Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I noticed Kante approaching, I picked up the ball and fired the shot without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of the match after the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, and then ran towards the middle of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly accepted the pass in the middle of the pitch.
Then he made a beautiful play forward into the penalty area back to Gambler.
The gambler overtook the defenders and with his left foot fired a shot towards the long pole, which passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
Indonesia’s disaster agency said on Sunday the death toll from the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country had risen to 832.
During the conference, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported that as a result of Friday's earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale, many people were trapped under the debris. In addition, the shock caused a tsunami wave with a height of 6 meters.
Inhabited by more than 380 thousand people, the city of Palu is full of debris of collapsed buildings.

The Cromwell Statue in front of the British Parliament is the last victim in the dispute over “rewriting history”
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England’s cultural and religious monuments by its radical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of the monuments, the dispute over the character of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster was a matter of time.
The outrageous actions during the English Civil Wars were neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier, it was decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft portrayed Cromwell on the monument shows the reputation that Cromwell had in the 19th century, and that for many, he is still a figure worth commemorating.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people saw Cromwell – perhaps more often in the 19th century than now – as a defender of parliament against external pressures.
Assessing how accurate this statement is is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and commemorated.”
In China, there was a deadly turbulence of a farmer by a pig
Local media reported a deadly pig attack on a farmer at a market in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bloodied and with a cut artery near a pigsty in a market in the city of Liupanshui, in the province of Kueizhou.
A pig farmer is preparing to carry out vaccinations in a pig house, on May 30, 2005, in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province (China).
According to reports, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found the man’s body and noticed the door open to a nearby pigsty.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood on his throat.
The autopsy confirmed that it was a 250-kilogram pig that killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and stained,” a man named Wu told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance footage shows Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Guiyang Evening News that the piglet had been isolated during police gathering to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man's family and the marketplace authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Pig attacks on humans have been reported in the past, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered fatal wounds.
Ten years earlier in Wales, a nearly 300-kilogram pig nailed a farmer to a tractor.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can trigger violent behavior in them.
“They just want to have fun.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect,” he said.
Residues from hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and southwestern parts of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa is blowing at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. Eastern time it was assigned to category 1. It was then located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to forecasts, on Sunday, Rosa will move to the north.
In the meantime, over the Pacific Ocean, it is beginning to form rather than heading east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving masses of humid air north to the southwestern United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in part of the territory of Mexico.
In the coming days, humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause heavy rainfall in the Southwest of the United States.
In some places, precipitation from 2.5 to 10 cm high will lead to sudden flooding, pollution displacement and possible landslides in desert areas.
Wet tropical air will cause rainfall from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is predicted in some parts of the Southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona.
Due to the diffuse nature of tropical rainfall, sudden flooding and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rains, it is strongly discouraged to move on foot in desert areas.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local gusty winds and dust displacement.
The coming than will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of Southern California.
Rains of a total height of more than 1.3 cm are possible, which can cause small displacements of pollutants and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region so far.
Tropical rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, rainfall will occur in more areas.
Heavy rains on Tuesday will reach the Four Corners region in the western United States and last until Wednesday.
In October, with the cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, temperature fluctuations may occur. However, in the intertropical zone it will be rather warm.
This can lead to rapid temperature changes over short distances.
A good example is Sunday’s temperature differences in the central United States.
Between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis (Missouri) and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, persistent summer temperatures may rise again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm beginning of October is expected. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to part of the Northeast.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature could reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interviews
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations Thursday's moving hearing of Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a lawyer of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to cut off regular broadcasts to announce a sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake under which the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100% sure that Kavanaugh groped her intoxicated and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said he was convinced that this had not happened.
It is possible that Friday’s number of viewers was even higher than Nielsen’s 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, figures were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring audiences in the workplace.
The number is close to the viewership of American football cup competitions or the American Film Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen reports, Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day audition.
In second place was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday’s events.
In the morning, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support the nomination of Kavanaugh. In the video, he shouts at the protesters who made it difficult for him to get into the elevator on his way to the hearing of the judicial committee.
Flake listened to unfavorable opinions with his head down for a few minutes. The whole event was broadcast by CNN.
“I stand here in front of you and ask.
Do you think he is telling the truth?
You have strength in the face of so many women's impotence," he said.
Before the elevator door was closed, Jeff Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he would speak during the committee's hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast the events in anticipation of a vote to hand over Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the allegations next week, as the Democratic minority insisted.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made the decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because the Republicans would not have had the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit to their advantage
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing into the future of Britain and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview besides that featuring Theresa May on the front page, Boris Johnson, the former foreign minister in her government, attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union in the aftermath of Brexit, according to which the UK and the EU could levy tariffs on their behalf, calling it “completely ridiculous”.
Wayde Sims Shot: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Murdering LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player of the Louisiana State University (LSU).
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and placed in custody on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. Police said that during the fight Sims lost his glasses.
According to CBS-linked WAFB, police officers found the glasses at the scene and found traces of Simpson’s DNA on them.
Police said after questioning Simpson that he had confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to the lawyer of the detainee, the amount of the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police headquarters thanked the Louisiana state police search team, the state police forensic lab, Southern University police and nearby residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s director of sports, thanked local law enforcement for “the hard work and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne Sims also played basketball at LSU.
In his last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“It’s one of those things we’re constantly afraid of,” said Will Wade.
Ash emitted by volcano reaches Mexico City
Ashes emitted from the Popocatépetl volcano have reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans against approaching the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center recorded numerous rumblings and shocks.
Photos posted on social media show car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash in Mexico’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico City in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of clashes between pro-independence demonstrators and police preventive units, on which thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the emotion-provoking referendum on Catalonia’s secession.
A group of masked supporters of the separation threw eggs and powder paint at police officers. Dark clouds of dust covered the streets, usually full of tourists.
The clashes also took place later in the day. In order to stop the fighting, police forces used batons.
For several hours, independence groups chanted “We do not forget, we do not forgive”. Opponents of secession shouted “Long live Spain”.
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical attention in connection with minor injuries suffered during the protests.
After a year since the referendum on 1 October, tensions have not subsided. Although the authorities in Madrid have deemed it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for Catalans seeking secession.
The overwhelming majority of voters voted in favour of independence. However, the turnout was low due to the widespread boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in violent clashes with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, groups supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent a demonstration in support of the police.
The demonstration was held, however, a change of route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part with his wife in a separatist protest, said there was no longer any hope of independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had one of the most beautiful moments of our lives.
My parents wept with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck at a point of no return," he said.
Despite a significant, albeit small, victory in the local elections in December last year, parties supporting Catalonia’s secession have struggled to continue their actions. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting trial in connection with the role played in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old cell phone mechanic recording a protest supporting the police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute were fueling the conflict.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his willingness to run in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis in the democratic values of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being hit by a car in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 British Time (BST).
Commissioner of Investigation Bob Blemmings said the damage had covered the gate and the building.
At some point, a crossbow shot could also have been fired at the car.
Mengi's goal ensures Livingston's 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought the team victory
Livingston, who have played in the Premier League since that season, stunned the Rangers with Steven Gerrard's second defeat in his 18 games as head coach at Ibrox Park.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be the winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the standings together with Hibernian.
The team led by Gerrard remains this season without a victory in the away Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader Hearts, to whom he loses eight points.
Earlier, because on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA Europa League.
Livingston extends the series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt has not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a few opportunities against undisputed opponents
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, because the team's game brought a lot of problems to the Rangers.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defense and fired a shot into the goal light, but he failed to score a goal. Then Alan Lithgow missed after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten rivals during the regular parts of the game.
And that is how the decisive goal fell.
After the Rangers took a free throw, the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the situation for Menga, who scored a goal from the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, however, they could not force the defense of the hosts and did not cause major problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
This pattern was repeated in the second half. Alfredo Morelos scored one shot at the goal of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to hit the goal light from another fixed piece destined for Livingston.
The Rangers continued to attack in the Livingston penalty area, but could not take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty kicks after Halkett's intervention against substitute Glenn Middleton and one hand play. In both cases, however, the players' claims were rejected.
Livingston’s “phenomenal” performance – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
He said they played well and once again exceeded expectations.
Their style and composition has hardly changed since returning to the extra-class. However, one should appreciate Holt for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role, leading a well-organized defense. Menga, on the other hand, made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall have to be very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although they have great moments under the leadership of Gerrard, they did not maintain their standards in this match.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once they managed to break through the defense of the hosts. This should be a serious warning for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
During Saturday’s breakfast in Berlin (September 29), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
This city is home to the largest number of Turks outside their homeland.
According to police, for security reasons, a crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the temple was blocked, but supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion, condemning the Turkish leader’s policy and the decision of the German government to accept the politician in the country.
Opposite protests reflect the divisions aroused by the visit of a politician hailed as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and medical rescuers arrived at the scene. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist took place on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working on identifying the deceased man and informing family members about the incident.
Roads were closed and bus tours were organized, and drivers were told to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penitentiary: Six Officers Injured in Riots
As reported by the authorities of the facility, six officers were injured as a result of riots in the penitentiary for men with a high level of security.
The riots at the HMP Long Lartin penitentiary in Worcestershire began around 9:30 a.m. British Time (BST) on Sunday and are still ongoing.
For the riots involving eight prisoners in one of the wings of the facility called a specialized unit "Tornado".
Officers on the scene sustained minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the facility said: “Specially trained personnel were involved in the action at the HMP Long Lartin penal facility.
Six of the officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities. We are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend more time in prison."
The HMP Long Lartin penitentiary has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports, in June, the director of the facility had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the plant was summoned to the prevention units because of the dangerous riots, in which employees were attacked with balls to play billiards.
Sudden floods caused by Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial impact on drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. This is likely to happen early next week. The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are moving through the desert areas of the Southwest, posing a threat of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to forecasts, on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. Rainfall will begin on Monday afternoon.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached 65 km from the Arizona state border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation with a height of 5 to 10 cm. In some areas, the Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In other desert areas of the Southwest – including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin – the rainfall is likely to be between 2.5 and 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For people outside the areas at risk of sudden floods, the rainfall accompanying Hurricane Rosa can bring relief, as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some rainfall will improve the situation in the Southwest, where droughts prevail.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of Arizona is battling severe droughts in the second-highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will hit the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to travel with hurricane force, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. She is currently 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and heading north at 19 km/h.
The hurricane hits the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
According to forecasts, it will hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a high flood risk.
Weather.com reported that "the area from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of Sonora is predicted to have a precipitation height of 7 to 15 cm, although it can reach 25 cm."
Hurricane Rosa will then pass through Mexico in the northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning hours, it will reach the Arizona state border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, it will wander into the southern part of the state of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall on the California Peninsula, in the northwestern part of Sonora and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center reports.
According to forecasts, the rains will cause life-threatening sudden flooding and the movement of pollution in the desert and mud avalanches in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested in Attempted Murder Case
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of attempted murder of a 16-year-old man found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 British Time (BST).
The victim was taken to hospital and her condition remains “stable”.
Police in Avon and Somerset said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man had been arrested in Radstock.
Officers are requesting contact from anyone with footage of the incident.
Trump Says Brett Kavanaugh 'Has Experienced the Wickedness and Wrath' of the Democratic Party
“The vote cast for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous conduct,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “feel the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress. He strongly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that several decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man sexually assaulted her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "Americans could see the brilliance, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote cast for Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of support for one of the greatest lawyers of our time, an expert in law with great merit for the community,” he told a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president did not directly address the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important choices in our lives.
I do not run in these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
“I’m still fighting to defend our great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats have a policy of “resisting and obstructing activity.”
As one of the assistants of an important Republican politician told CNN, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. The number of victims is growing
Authorities said on Saturday at least 384 people were killed — many of them kidnapped by high waves crashing on beaches — in the aftermath of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Pal to take part in the festival in the city. At dusk, waves hit the shore as high as 6 meters, kidnapping many people and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the threat arose yesterday, the people on the beach did not immediately escape and were the victims of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPD disaster agency, at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami attacked everything in its path, hijacking cars, logs and houses," Nugroho reported. Then he added that before reaching the coastline, the element was moving at a speed of 800 km/h at sea.
As he said, some were saved by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by a second quake.
In the area of 2.4 million people there were a number of earthquakes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT), the energy released by the massive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement said the geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the tsunami's effects.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He added that the bodies of the victims were found under the collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 people are believed to be missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the coastline 300km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala that was closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
According to Nugroho, the communications were "completely paralyzed" and there were no reports from Donggala province.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that the organization’s staff and volunteers are heading to the disaster sites.
“Already now we can talk about a tragedy, although the situation may deteriorate significantly,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency faced widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami in Palu, but authorities said the waves came just after the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man is seen shouting from a building, trying to warn of an impending tsunami of people on the street.
Within minutes, the water wall smashed against the shore, hijacking buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power shortages, preventing communication within Palu, which in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities say the military has begun sending transport aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport, located in the city, is open only for transports with humanitarian aid. The airport will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
More than 800 dead in Indonesia tsunami.
The situation is very bad.
Doseba T. Sinay, World Vision’s national director, reported that the organization’s staff arrived safely from the province of Donggala to the city of Palu and found shelter in tarpaulin tents erected in the office’s courtyard.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some groups are slowly starting to deliver aid, there have been criticisms that foreign aid workers with extensive experience are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, the reception of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only begin after the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't been done yet.
“Officially, we are still dealing with a regional disaster,” a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross said.
“When the government recognizes that there is a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but that has not yet happened.”
Two days after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palo, friends and families of the missing continue to hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves amidst the devastation.
A little boy was taken out of the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders participating in the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, the other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
“As an experienced paraglider, I struggle with my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Subandono told how within hours of the paragliders’ announcement about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
“It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while replenishing cash at ATM at Newport on the Levee Mall
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was replenishing cash at an ATM in the Newport on the Levee shopping mall.
“The driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to replenish the cash,” Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
Another man “runs from behind to a Brink employee” and steals a bag of cash from an ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of the thief are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote of himself: “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
The forty-year-old musician has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time now. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change came before a visit to Saturday Night Live. The artist is expected to present his new album Yandhi during the performance.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creators, resigned from the program “for emotional reasons”.
West has previously stated that the word "Yes" is not only an abbreviation of his current artistic nickname, but has a religious meaning.
"It seems to me that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Bible, it means "you"," said West earlier in the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter named Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it is about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album shows who we are.”
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known under the pseudonyms Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, West's former collaborator, also wrote down his nickname in various ways, with a binder, without a binder, and in capital letters.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador vows not to use military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on student demonstrations, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) vowed never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, López Obrador vowed “never to use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire in the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing as many as 300 people. The event occurred at a time when left-wing student movements were beginning to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly financial assistance to learners, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal groups.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert in artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as China’s activity in this area grows, the United States should double its spending on AI research.
The remark has to do with announcements about artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, even though the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Last year, China unveiled its plan to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“To begin with, we need to double the budget for AI research: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling the funds could double the chances of making another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book titled “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures+, the company with the most significant investment in China.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an AI system that defeated the then best American gamer Othello. He then held a management position at Microsoft Research and was the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the success of previous U.S. government technology initiatives, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot designs, and asked about the date of the next edition of the struggle, because he believes it will help to find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that’s taking away our top academics, it’s taking away our top corporations,” Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring prominent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States develop AI.
“I believe that people who are engaged in artificial intelligence, who have received a PhD, should automatically be granted a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As Lee noted, China’s National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to that of the U.S. National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations granting funds to U.S. scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage industry and science partners, while the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA also announced that it would spend $2 billion on an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 billion a year in AI research.
At the same time, the US initiative to create a national commission on the safety of artificial intelligence has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country’s name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would help resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which is blocking the country's bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in whose territory the historical land of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory. Therefore, it vetoed the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority living in Macedonia.
President <0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging the boycott has raised doubts about whether the attendance will reach the minimum level of 50% required to declare the referendum binding.
In the referendum, the following question was asked: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of Macedonia – one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia – joining organizations such as the European Union or NATO.
“I voted for the future of my country, so that young Macedonians can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will ensure greater security for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
The name change requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The state election commission said that no unusual events had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at that time was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, when 66% of eligible voters voted.
“I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old <0xC7><0xB4>osze Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in the Macedonian city of Strumica, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum to change the country’s name to open the way for NATO and European Union membership.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of the tents laid out by people boycotting the referendum.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with a raised head, and not the back door,” said Kavardarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China or Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour of the name change in the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “yes” vote was a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute, between 30 and 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote in Sunday’s referendum.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
In order for the vote to be successful, the attendance must be 50% + 1 vote.
The defeat of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City beats the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent home the Brighton defenders in Saturday's 2-0 match for Manchester City, played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal scored by Aguera in the 65th minute looked childishly easy.
The action began with the passing of the Argentine attacker in the middle of the field.
The player has overtaken three defenders from Brighton.
Aguero was among Brighton's four players.
First he beat one of them, then he overtook the others and ended up on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Field.
Then he played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for it.
The English forward immediately passed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty area, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the goal.
“Aguero is struggling with a foot injury,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have a goal in that time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Blues the first lead in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero received the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great pass along the left side of the pitch to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to the far post.
The Manchester City striker pointed the ball to the net just before it hit the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of the Rockies winning
After losing the chance to play in the playoffs by the Washington Nationals, Scherzer did not have to play in the first squad.
However, the rival Scherzer hopes to play in Sunday's match against the Colorado Rockies, if only the Rockies have a chance to play in the playoffs. Currently, the team has one more victory than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
The Rockies can at least count on a wild card if they win Friday’s match against the Nationals by a score of 5:2. However, they still want to win their first division title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be on the pitch, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn’t I want to attend this meeting?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for Sunday's meeting. However, the team is inclined to put Scherzer in the first line-up.
It would be Scherzer’s thirty-fourth appearance in the first squad. The player took part in Thursday’s kickoff training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The Washington team's right-handed pitcher scored 18-7 and ERA 2.53. He eliminated batters 300 times and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court Justice, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“In November, we are putting all our achievements on the scale.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I do not run, I remain very active. I constantly defend our great candidates," he said.
Then he continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats. We see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by any means possible, they're mean and malicious.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control. Taking power and control is their goal. But we won’t give it back to them.”
As he said, the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct activity.”
“It’s been very clear in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, mean, unpleasant and untrue.”
The president addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein from the name and surname, which was met with a loud buzz from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the document leak?
“Oh, what?
No... I mean... no." Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the activists of Momentum in my party voted to rebuke me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am a member of a group of Labour Members who have recently been told that they are not welcome, all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for reprimand stemmed from a difference of opinion between myself and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
Friday’s announcement of a meeting of Labour MPs from the Nottingham East district read: “We want meetings to be open and productive.”
In my eight years as a Labour Member, most of the Friday afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked exactly like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings now take place differently, and the promise of a “more cordial and gentler” policy, if ever remembered, has long been forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party; each opinion is judged in terms of compliance with the leadership of the party.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took over the presidency, and colleagues, who I thought shared similar views, began to expect me to change direction and take positions that I would not have agreed with before, such as national security or the EU single market.
After every public speech – regardless of the content – I encounter on social media attacks calling for the withdrawal of nominations, the condemnation of centrism or the departure of the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are more of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment on a daily basis, but do not shy away from further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of current politics is moving on to an agenda of insulting others.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for a “vote of mistrust” and every change in the rules of choice, the party’s worldview is narrowed down.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly suggested that I keep my head down and keep quiet about certain things, so that everything “would be fine.”
But that is not why I took up politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government that led to the disintegration of my school classroom, I have been trying to provide better public services to those in need – both as a local councillor and a minister.
I never hid my beliefs, not even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and they knew my differences with the party authorities.
To those who supported Friday’s proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of an impending Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services.
However, the most important message I am sending is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both Labour Party members and others): I am proud to serve you. I promise that no threat of withdrawal of nominations or ad hoc political objectives will discourage me from acting in accordance with my convictions and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17 – undefeated Ayr again top
Two late touchdowns could have somehow distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting match in the Scottish Extraliga.
The team ranked first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, the outstanding defense and better use of opportunities led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his pupils.
“The matches so far have been a challenge for us, but we are still invincible, so I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “We have to pay tribute to Ayr’s players. They have used the opportunities better than we have.”
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute after scoring Grant Anderson and raising Frazier Clima. However, a yellow card for Scot Rory Hughes, who came to the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to equalize the score when Jason Baggott caught the ball after an unused chance.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after kicking off a penalty kick just before the end of the first half. He first scored a touchdown and then took advantage of the opportunity to raise, achieving a 17:5 score for Ayr.
Melrose had a good start in the second half. Patrick Anderson's raise by Baggott reduced the loss to five points.
The player was removed from the field on a stretcher. After the resumption of the game, Ayr increased the lead after the touchdown of Stafford McDowall and the promotion of Clima.
The team's acting captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose again used his numbers: a touchdown with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Clima without the ball. MacPherson scored a touchdown on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the chance to raise. He then again managed to raise the score immediately after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught a penalty shot and allowed wingman Gregor Henry to score a fifth touchdown for the hosts.
The star of the series Still Game starts a career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting out in the catering industry. It has recently been revealed that he has become the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, starring and co-creating the series with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the history of the series. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a Scottish Sun source suggested Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "growing catering industry" in Glasgow.
'The sea belongs to us': Bolivia, denied access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the vicinity of the naval base in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying from public buildings.
In naval ports from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to regain him."
In a landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, like a dream of re-navigating the Pacific Ocean.
Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice's ruling, due to be delivered on 1 October after a five-year trial.
“Bolivia’s actions are gaining momentum. The people are unanimous, optimistic and count on a favorable verdict,” Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians across the country will jointly watch the session of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the organization based in The Hague will recognize Bolivia's claim and, after decades of fruitless talks, Chile will have to start negotiations on granting the state independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic president who will face a controversial re-election fight next year, also puts hope in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore in late August.
However, some analysts say that the chances of a favorable decision for Bolivia are small, and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also reserved that it will not affect the arrangements for possible talks.
As Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, said, the International Court of Justice's decision will come six months after the final arguments have been presented.
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the past four years may have driven the country away from its target.
“The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration,” Paz Zárate said.
Morales’ unyielding rhetoric deprived Chileans of any remnants of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the current situation.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, Bolivia’s former president and representative in The Hague, disagreed with the court’s decision-making process being extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end a 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the topic of access to the sea as part of political gameplay.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The verdict is an excellent opportunity to convince ourselves that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korean officials say there will be no nuclear disarmament until they can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons as long as it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s “frozen” that the lack of lifting of sanctions and the U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War have ever brought North Korea to its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about dismantling the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only security measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows herald the emergence of the latest line of great headgear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a series of crazy, oversized headgear included in their 2019 summer collection, which dazzled with style during Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats prevailed on Instagram this summer. The above-mentioned designers decided to present their stunning creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s outstanding work was a giant beige hat decorated with a wide feathered roundabout flooding the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple—but they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn up lips and resembled more the style of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled scuba gear with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like melted ice cream.
And if you do not want to break up with great fashion, you are in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats can go to clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow La Bomba, a straw hat with a 61 cm-wide roundabout that has been worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which spilled through social media, presented another great creation on the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as a model wearing her in a swimsuit.
The flaming orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and topped with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the summer season 2019 during Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to be in stores next summer — because the designer has been able to make such a big impact, it would be hard not to exploit the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: the language skills necessary for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their academic achievements – in 2018 they could boast of more excellent exam results, supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other social endeavors.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the schools, attended by more than 30,000 students across Scotland, strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the ability to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages occupy the first place in league rankings, with the highest proficiency rates for independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language scored higher than A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students got a higher A in Mandarin and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also got an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as elective subjects, is carried out in the same scope as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as part of curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of job vacancies were caused by the lack of language skills of candidates.
Therefore, linguistic skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for their careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language skills,
A lifelong skill, like learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future – regardless of your career path.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person compared to the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language whose percentage of speakers was two-digit, i.e. 15%.
That’s why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught there.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interests, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed – no matter what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer Scots youth a great deal of choice, diversity and level.
It's just the right thing to do.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James debut at the Los Angeles Lakers have finally arrived.
Luke Walton, the Lakers’ coach, announced that LeBron James will play in Sunday’s pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don’t know how many minutes he will play.
"More than one, but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six pre-season games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to go to pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
So Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump-scheduled election rallies to be held next week, along with stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming the suspension of his election to a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support in the upcoming election on the government’s heels, as Republicans may be at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time will the Trump election rally in West Virginia be held tonight, and where will it be available on the Internet?
So the Trump election in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place today at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So, the election Trump in West Virginia will be able to follow live on the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the expected Senate vote to suspend the election for a maximum of one week, for the duration of the FBI’s investigation.
However, the main purpose of this series of election rallies is to provide support to Republicans facing difficult November elections.
So President Trump’s five-meeting campaign next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and supporters to assist Republicans in protecting and expanding the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an important point on the president’s agenda that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Today's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the media from Pittsburgh" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the past month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Spirit, Maintaining Hope of Winning Sunday’s Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could be what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but one that athletes really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So what does their momentum look like at the moment?
“They were leading six points and now they are leading only four, so I think we have a little bit of momentum,” Jordan Spieth said.
Of course, Europe leads by four points, while there are still twelve to score.
Americans, Spieth says, feel the wind in their sails and have worthy role models to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them could boast of scoring three out of four points.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and sets an example.
The screams all over his throat, a sign of excitement, became louder and louder throughout his round, sinking a key putt and winning the match as he and Thomas scored two holes in two strokes.
His rebound on the ground, which gave them a victory with a score of 15, met with a similar shout — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in play.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming couple of the European team won four out of four and were not wrong.
“Moliwood” is the only couple who failed to score a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way the game is played and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players must be beaten on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could seal a potential European team victory at Le Golf National.
It would be best if they played on different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about a victory for the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of fourball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and a double nine on the front dumped the Swede and the Spaniard into a hole they would never get out of.
On Sunday, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy change can happen in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and took a significant lead on the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team has a keenness to fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes leading on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning with the result of 10-6 Saturday fourball and foursome matches with the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the duo scored two victories over Tiger Woods, boosting their previous Le Golf National score to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, trying to preserve the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the imprecise American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States resisted more in the foursome format, winning two games, but could not regain the loss.
In order to retain the trophy, Jim Furyk’s team must score eight points out of 12 singles on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while along with Molinari (the band was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fourball format in great style, they defeated pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathetic 5&4 score.
Woods, who had been exhausted for two Saturday matches, occasionally showed a glimpse of genius, but has so far lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, not taking part in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – ranked 1st and 3rd in the world rankings, respectively.
The European team, however, did not get everything right on this pleasant, cool day in a field stretching southwest of Paris.
The three-time main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 victory over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4&3 score in the foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has it happened that the team made up a four-point loss by starting a single, although Furyk's team would only need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday’s counterattack seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says “strong no” to unilateral disarmament without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday in a speech at the United Nations that the lack of lifting of sanctions only exacerbates North Korea's lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way the country will unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as suspending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and committing to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any concrete response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s reluctance to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step action, his statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization in the past, as it did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent president of the United States and the leader of North Korea, held on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea expected a formal end to the Korean War (1950–1953), but the U.S. delegation announced that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, even opposing the signing of a ‘declaration to end the war,’” Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who act ignorantly toward us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of lifting of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the US leader spoke about earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: “If the denuclearization side had been South Korea and not the United States, then there would not have been such a deadlock on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
Mim this, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on U.S. soil was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim Jong Un a “rocket man” (a self-made man).
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but also said there was still a lot of work to be done, and also said that until North Korea is de-nuclearized, sanctions will not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a timeline for it, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue and be continuous until we find full, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to curb funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, and within hours, North Korea condemned him for “making gangster demands.”
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon Jae-in this month to dismantle the missile test site and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim Jong Un had told him that the “appropriate measures” he wanted were the security guarantees Trump had pledged in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on adequately long rest periods
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all students with more sleep, aimed at combating the growing macho culture of learning by “caffeine-driven all-night students.”
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired by giving a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now that I’m in my final year of college?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, as well as improve students’ overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health service, said the course was decided to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes an image of a dorm room where students click coffee cups, curtains, exercises, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as how important it is to maintain sleep regularity.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know — just as everyone has a right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in “all-night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean an increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
Ensuring enough good-quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, making the student constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the introduction of a course for the entire campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm to remind them when to go to sleep and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes down Gerrard's team
The Rangers were once again injured in a fight away in Livingston when Dolly Meng shot Steven Gerrard's dismantled team to a 1-0 loss.
The team at Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first victory since a 4-1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for a second time in 18 games, causing his team an eight-point difference from leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga scored a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers squad showing a lack of commitment did not look like he was going to improve.
While the Rangers dropped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third, just behind Hibernian with a loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may have further problems due to the need to treat the head wound of linear referee Calum Spence after he was hit by an object thrown from the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed him to overtake Ayr and move to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, passed with the same Livingston eleven that took the point to the Hearts last week, being the delightful way his well-trained team has been toiling at every turn of his opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but the Livingston team did more with the ball once they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when Menga's first pitch allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder did not take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow could only stay in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked as if they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he deserved a penalty kick fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless ran into each other, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers were only able to fire two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute could have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put into scoring it.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t cope with Jacobs’ deep, permanent snippet of the game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher tossed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm, handing it to Menga in order to finish the action simply.
Gerrard took a break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, an exchange that almost immediately affected the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to draw guests into the game exactly as they liked, as Lithgow and Halkett made long passes one by one.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor stood well before Jacobs, after which Lithgow pushed the game out of the corner.
The Rangers reserve, Glenn Middleton, once again hoped for a penalty kick when he got tangled up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes away again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our edition of "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a part of both science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which featured the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.”
Evans: "Now you hear something!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” enemy cells.
A New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to “See” and Destroy Enemy Cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize enemy cells as part of treatment.
This method involves isolating immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can “see” the protein common to many cancers, and then they are re-injected into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize hostile cells experienced ovarian cancer disappearance for more than 18 months.
The method involves isolating immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then injecting them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine is very promising.”
HER2 “drives the proliferation of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of collecting immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to locate cancer cells has worked in the treatment of some type of leukemia.
Kanye West goes on a pro-Trump diatribe on Saturday Night Live — with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would be running for office in 2020.
After performing that night’s third track, Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap that read “Make America Great,” he delivered a speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, I hear, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist!’
If I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock wanted to make fun of West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
“They came after me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're after me!
And then they say I have no choice," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You say I don’t have a choice?” adding, “I’m going to put on a “superman pelerina” so you won’t be able to tell me what to do.
Let's accept each other."
His words twice caused a “buzz” of the audience, and the members of the SNL team looked embarrassed, reports Variety. A person who was in the studio during these events: “The grave silence prevailed in the studio.”
West was invited to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with the performance of the song I Love It in the disguise of a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR STAYING WITH THE MAFIA.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was just "he himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
“However, I will NOT reward a person (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who, I believe, accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are free too,” she added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that now "formally his name is Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed his name to the symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington raises the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor struck a stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on screen makes young boys often think they need to play tough to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted he feels “quite confident” about the issue.
“Personally, I feel pretty confident at this point — where did we make a mistake on the subject of masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, from the perspective of the problem we are currently facing?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity due to the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate, and what are learned?
What does he learn on TV and in the streets that makes young boys think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It’s clear that not everything is okay with young men.”
In an interview, he also admitted that he would no longer play in any of the prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones after the series ends next year, saying that he "was done with battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s “True West,” a story about a film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that has ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“On set, I met my wife, which provided me with my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte — the object of the love interest of the character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Sees 14% Increase in New Cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected, according to health workers in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year on year, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ensured universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members disclosed Republican senators’ data — a “dangerous lie” and “conspiracy theory.”
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her team posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
A Los Angeles-based Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and websites linked to "ultra-right wings."
“Lies, lies, and even more vile lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person at the Capitol during a panel hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators challenged Kavanaugh's candidacy.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and published information about a member of the Waters team, Hill said.
“This unfounded allegation is completely false and is a one hundred percent lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and is a one hundred percent lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman.
“This kind of denial is wrong,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they can’t be wrong.
He can't provoke.
He cannot question the motives of the accused.
But he must remain calm.”
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of displaying excessive anger during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s a rough thing if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified “competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.”
“The perpetrators will be exposed and held legally accountable for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team,” she said.
Review of Johnny English: Knockout – A Spy Parody with a Weakened Rowan Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new film with a British theme has become the norm. This seems to be the case for the new part of the action and comedy series "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the cinemas in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-deprecating satire about how hopeless we are become the country’s new export commodity?
In any case, ever-surprised by the rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has been re-licensed — his name, more than anything else, signals that he is an elaborate, comic work designed for non-English-speaking audiences.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre fondness for smoothie glamour, has a touch of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasio Bean and a drop of this guy adding one note to the melody of the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-class man-mystery—Atkinson played in once-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials in which he left a mess behind.
The latest film in the Johnny English series has one or two moments worth noting.
I really liked the scene in which Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically hit by the rotor blades.
The screen clearly shows Atkinson's gift for physically playing comedy, but a sense of humor seems to be quite low-flying and unnecessary, especially since now also "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be aimed at children rather than adults — I don’t think Johnny English’s crazy adventures are as imaginative and coherent as the gags in Atkinson’s silent films about Jas Beans.
The current assumption has always been that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyberhacker infiltrates Britain’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents operating in the field – to the horror of the agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the bitterness of the prime minister, who is a pompous, wasted character already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power to play the role of Theresa May, but the script does not give her the opportunity to develop wings.
Her advisors from the intelligence agency inform her that due to the disclosure of the identities of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few nice gags while giving English spying lessons.
English is summoned to Whitehall for a briefing, reuniting with his former sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the submarine commander, a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin of the Brigade in Her Majesty's secret service return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, the character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously taken over by a charismatic tech-maniac billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems – the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: disguised as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; introduce chaos by sneaking aboard a luxury Volta yacht; and English wreaks havoc while using a virtual reality set to get acquainted with the interior of Volta’s house.
In this last sequence, all limitations disappear, but despite the nice and noisy performance, the whole film is very similar to children's television.
Typical average.
As with other films in the Johnny English series, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is drafting a plan that provides for a four-day work week for British workers, for which they will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary of five days.
The party is said to want business executives to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to workers, giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend with the same amount of pay.
The sources say that this idea will “fit” into the party’s economic program and plans to leave the country to meet the workers.
The move to a four-day work week was backed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour member told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy change will be announced by the end of this year.”
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day week of work is something that fits into the party’s approach to restoring economic equilibrium to the benefit of the worker, as well as into the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party has pledged to introduce a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not a party policy and its introduction is not being considered by the party.”
John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, used last week’s Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless CEOs” and “speculators” in public utility companies.
The shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not regain all of their shares, as the Labour government could make “deductions” based on detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10 percent of private-sector companies’ equity to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond in 60 Minutes to the question of whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation can make them change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised questions about whether the findings of the Bureau of Investigation could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when this accusation came up, and I asked, “Did you do it?”
He was firm, determined and unambiguous.”
Graham’s opinion, however, seems to be carved in stone.
“I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change it, a strong accusation is needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people he mentions could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty in any way?
Next Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York City, an annual music event that boasts an incredibly impressive line-up of performing stars and an equally impressive mission – eradicating poverty in the world.
Held for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy performances by stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important goal of this event, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of activists working to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you have decided to purchase a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to complete a number of tasks or "activities" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other significant activities to help raise awareness of the goal of eradicating poverty.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast in terms of the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or another case of so-called “clicktivism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by supporters since 2011, aiming to achieve many different goals.
He also claims that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and promoters committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which pledged to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after Global Citizen members sent more than 4,700 tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition Ambassador, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after implementing more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the quality of nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website was “How do you know you can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road —sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But as with the great civil rights movements of the past and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars performing at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy to ‘Block’ Russian Energy Exports — Home Secretary
Washington can “if necessary” resort to its navy to prevent the influx of Russian energy into markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of internal Affairs of the United States, Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government — was a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate in energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, through its navy, has the ability to make sure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to a “one-trick pony” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come as the Trump administration continues its mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe – a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is designed to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project stems solely from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States provoked a violent reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think it’s a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said she would consider running for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, and it’s time for women to go to the top,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will consider my candidacy for the presidency.”
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has unreservedly expressed her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters choosing the “probably” option said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent of people supported his potential candidacy and 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp taken into consideration in relation to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) of Track Palin during Donald Trump’s election rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has to go through on his return, I understand other families who are suffering the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with," she told audiences at a Donald Trump election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son’s arrest “a taboo subject,” after which she said of her son and other war veterans: “They come back a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if respect will be shown for what their fellow soldiers, aviators and all the other members of the military have given to their country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, inciting him to make false statements in a domestic violence report, and possession of a gun in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the fight against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and a district filed an amicus curi<0xC3><0xA6> letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his brutal gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors in Grace’s favor have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where large numbers of asylum seekers live in the U.S., as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement Friday, District Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the letter said.
Prosecutors went on to argue in the letter that the policy of denying immigrants entry was damaging to the U.S. economy, arguing that they could become entrepreneurs and “become a necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or because of belonging to a particular social group or having such rather than other political beliefs,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement on asylum policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems—even the serious ones—that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the death toll doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Lack of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching for things soaked in water and trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, quickly overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors for the occurrence of severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I’ve been squeezed into the rubble of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then her voice stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “harassment” by propaganda ads.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6 — China denies the allegation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new stage in Washington’s escalation of its campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating the trade war, which has led to tariffs being raised on mutual imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa — a major exporter of agricultural products to China — said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register that China "is now starting harassment with redoubled force by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the respected American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
But there will be no opposition in the street kiosk in Beijing and no real reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the worrying economic direction chosen by China, given that the media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans frustrate women with the right to vote ahead of midterm elections over the Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault allegations, the analyst warns that these members will face a violent reaction during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotion surrounding this event is extremely high, and the majority of Republicans already want to officially vote.
“That can’t be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School.
Reeher said he had doubts about whether Senator Jeff Flake’s efforts to conduct a last-minute FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow and they won’t forget it by November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “November is coming,” demonstrating in the Senate lobby over the Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission’s decision not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he was already tall — and it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her sexual assault allegations against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans decided to approve the candidacy, it could be met with a violent reaction.
“The Republican Party has a lot of mess to deal with,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is elected, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats elect, said in a statement.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with the latter having a little more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents firmly or rather believed Ford’s testimonies, while 35 percent said they firmly or rather believed Kavanaugh’s testimonies.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied when giving testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI launched an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals during a reception at Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with the platforms of Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of creating Inrupt was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“The historic moment has come.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow people to create their own “personal data online store” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
A unique feature of an online store with personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s president, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide resources, processes, and the right skills to help make the Solid platform accessible to all people.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will turn all their business models upside down overnight.
“I don’t ask permission.”
In a post on the Medium platform on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to deliver commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been heavily involved in the debate on net neutrality.
With the creation of Inrupt Berners-Lee, he will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited to think about the next era in network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: decoration of a clergyman with the Victoria Cross during World War I
The memory of the only clergyman of the Church of England, who during World War I was awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Reverend Bernard Vann was decorated on 29 September 1918 for his attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said the stone’s unveiling on his grandfather’s 100th birthday was “extremely symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal “in very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
Then he hurried to the line of fire and with the "greatest courage" he led it forward, after which he single-handedly attacked the field cannons, neutralizing three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never handle, but at the same time humble.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid the wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine not sleeping all night to watch the emotion-packed Bellator 206 gala and finally not being able to see the main fight.
The San Jose gala program featured 13 fights, including six on the home card, and was broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in the UK were shocked to change the show to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after not sleeping until the early hours of the morning specifically to see the fight.
A Twitter fan described the switch to a children’s cartoon as “some kind of sick joke.”
“According to the government’s decree, content of this kind is inappropriate to be broadcast at 6 a.m., which required a change to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they would work on a schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
“When I think of a repeat of the situation, I think we can fix it,” Coker said.
“But it is Sunday at six o’clock in the morning, so we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change of program, we were flooded with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a flaw, it was a legal issue.
I can promise you this will not happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to the standard amount. We wanted to please the fans too much, and unfortunately we overreacted.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘worse’ because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that not everyone is like him until he went to high school.
In the Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this long-running program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing on Laverne's first-ever program, Daley said that growing up, he felt "less valuable" than others because "simultaneous liking boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said, “To this day, this feeling of being less and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove he was "something worthy" so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to express himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly, without any implications, and in this way he wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" to fall in love with a man -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such an age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and the death of his father from cancer three years later, he said it was hard for him to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June. Daley said that his perception of certain things has completely changed.
“Last year, the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be with us to be in the first row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died, I realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics — it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
This also inspired him to choose his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparations for the Olympics and which still gives him the goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing no uniform Mickelson on the bench during the Saturday part of the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to work on his form to keep his mark.
Mickelson, who plays for the twelfth time in a biennial event, was sent back to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in his case with the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend a day cheering the team and working to improve his game in the hope of fixing the reason for his sentencing to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who has never given the simplest shots, even at the peak of his career, is not doing very well on the narrow Le Golf National field, where vicious shots are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself isn’t discouraging enough for Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game he must face the precision of British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start the game with a head start, Mickelson’s match may prove to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player — he probably could not do anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, embraced me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is in the gallery of celebrities and has contributed a lot to the game of his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's what happened, and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws. Furyk said that his presence contributed a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, ridiculous, and it’s good to have him in the band’s room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week, which was nice to see.
He’s more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where he and his companion, Vice Captain Sev Ballesteros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but passed the finish line by the shortest possible hair, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It’s not to forget that we had a big advantage on the Valderrama field; we also had a big advantage on the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the case of the Valderrama field we won only by a haircut,” Bjorn said, in the photo, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, giving a 10-6 lead on the National Le Golf field.
Time will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will do your best.
Go out there and do everything right.
It will end only when the points appear on the board.
Our goal is to win the trophy, and that’s where we need to focus.
“I’ve said from the beginning that I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know very well who the people on the other side are – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players handled the difficult field, added: “I couldn’t have done better.
But tomorrow is different.
We’re going to be single tomorrow, that’s another matter.
It’s good to play with your partner when everything goes according to plan, but when you’re playing alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit.
“The message we need to convey to the players is to do our best tomorrow.
Your partner has to do his best too.”
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to perform better alone than when playing with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced a major turnaround on his final day as a member of the winning team at Brookline Field, after which he was defeated after the European team performed a “miracle at Medinah Field.”
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, warmed up to the fight of his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we’re playing 12 important matches – you’d like to start playing at a fast pace, as was the case at Brookline and Medinah.
If this rush goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our squad accordingly and set the guys up in a way that would allow us to cast a spell on tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to lead the counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter—other European players in the top half of the program.
“I chose this group of guys in that order because I think they can handle the whole game,” Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
New German warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs at an alarming rate, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but due to the problems that arose after the delivery, it was necessary to make changes to this ambitious project.
Four units of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, ensuring, among others, the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance — operating new frigates should be possible for up to two years away from the home ports.
Continuous delays mean, however, that these modern warships, designed to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete when service begins.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media reported a number of key "software and hardware defects" that rendered the ship useless in a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly significant, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, or half as many as the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to carry out future modernizations.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice the weight of similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project — including crew training — also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the commissioning of new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that the strength of the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, admitted that the navy “is running out of ships that can be used.”
He also said that the problem was exacerbated over time by the decommissioning of old vessels without the provision of replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the navy fleet.
National Trust eavesdrop on the secret lives of bats
A new study conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands area aims to show how bats use the landscape to obtain food.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and help guide future actions to protect them.
The research, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will look at common and small dwarfs, as well as brown long-eared bats and bats from the red-eared nightshade family at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be deployed in key locations around the estate to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field research using portable detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings aims to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and the behavior of individual species.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow formation, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects the beds and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can fly glues and certain chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to search for worms and obstacles in their path.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, checks on the piles, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
David Thompson, the owner of the estate, says that it is an ideal territory for bats.
“Threave has a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns when it comes to bats. The work we do here and in other estates will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before undertaking maintenance work on farms, as the inadvertent destruction of one hedge can kill up to 400 females and young, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected —killing, harassing, or disturbing them, as well as destroying their stock, is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we don’t even know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Allegations While His Lawyers Plan to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published these allegations.
The Portuguese striker of Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel reports on Friday, the footballer had to pay the woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years old), a few hours after the allegations were announced, described the news as “fake news” in a live Instagram feed addressed to his 142 million followers.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said the five-time winner of the gold ball.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on charges they called “unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room where he allegedly raped a woman anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent a good guy” who was deceived by that “one percent.”
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but this was done by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old says she now wants to nullify the settlement because she still cannot forget about the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million for it.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' carmakers leaving
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after leaving the European Union, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He said he was “disturbed” when a Toyota UK representative told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, production at the plant in Burnaston near Derby would be temporarily halted.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without a deal, then there will be a stoppage of production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other British carmakers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW is planning to close its Mini car factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what automakers say are the risks posed by the supply chain if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be difficulties at the border, which industry officials say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota said it would not have been able to withstand more than a day without deliveries to its Derbyshire plant.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely constructed to avoid border controls.”
“We want to reach the best possible agreement, which will not only allow us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to make good use of this situation,” he said on BBC Radio 4.
“Not only Toyota’s statements, but also those of other manufacturers, show that we need to be able to continue what has been a very smooth supply chain.”
Toyota’s representative office was unable to say how long production would be suspended, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the factory board of Unite, said the union members are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if there is a job cut, they will never be reinstated.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” due to the ongoing battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s close associates and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing wiretaps to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
On Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was about to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. The meeting was postponed to avoid interfering with a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a Senate vote.
A Trump spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There is no date yet for this meeting, it may take place this week, and it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, I’ll tell the press.”
Several journalists disputed the statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host of the program, Chris Wallace, asked the reason for this.
Sanders said the small number of press conferences was not due to a reluctance to "ostentatious" television journalists, adding: "I will not hide that they are 'ostentatious'.
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The current president holds more ‘questions and answers’ sessions than any other president before him,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve read the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, that’s a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do this regularly, and we have done this very often over the past few weeks, and press conferences will give way to sessions where you can talk directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is by behaving too loosely and sometimes bizarrely in front of assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from the European Union countries employed in the Scottish health service to convey their gratitude from the country and ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain leaves the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of examining ‘settled status’ applications for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations for the UK’s exit from the European Union continued in the summer, and appropriate decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers striker Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery after suffering a head injury in a Saturday match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended in a 31-27 loss to the Tennessee Tigers, Mike Organ said.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the athlete suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
“He walked up to the sideline, then landed on the ground,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed him on a stretcher and carried him out for further testing.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/size of the injury yet," and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student discharged from representing the university for a year to hone his skills) plays his first season with the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the match he had five charges, which gives him 18 charges throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax charge when buying real estate in the UK
According to the new Tories plans, buyers from abroad will be charged higher tax fees for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds obtained in this way will be used to help the homeless.
This move is intended to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract a young electorate.
Tax increases will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will be charged a higher tax charge, and the additional funds obtained in this way will be used to help the homeless.
The move is seen as an attempt to offset Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises of cheaper housing and increase the burden on more earners.
Higher taxes will apply to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK. Additional funds are intended to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional charge — in addition to the current tax charge, including higher rates for second homes and apartments purchased for rent two years ago — can amount to as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise as much as <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by residents of other countries, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult to buy the first house or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time abroad, many wealthy regions —especially the capital— have turned into “ghost cities.”
The new rules come just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the land but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits on cheap housing in order to eliminate the "housing scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of evictions “for no reason”.
It also wants to give local governments more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as Prime Minister, I would be committed to rebuilding the British dream of making every generation’s life better than the previous one.
It also means repairing our shaky housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy real estate here with equal ease as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very distant, but the humiliation associated with the need to spend the night on the street remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to be Scotland's coach"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's national team manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is committed to rehabilitating North-East, which currently ranks third in League One with a three-point loss to the top team.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I was only able to get to squad B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, my father and I watched a lot of Scottish football games in Hampden, and I’ve always been drawn to it.
But that will only happen if I succeed as a coach.”
Ross' predecessors as coach of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn’t feel intimidated after taking on the role of such prominent personalities at such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my success will be measured by my ability to bring this club back into the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities it has at its disposal, undoubtedly there is its place," he adds.
“It won’t be easy to do that, but I’ll probably feel like I’m a success here, only if I can do it.”
Ross' coaching career has only lasted for three years. Before that, he was assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months he was a member of the coaching team of the Hearts.
He then helped Allo promote again after being relegated to the third league, and in the following season he led the St Mirren team from the edge of decline to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real turning point,” Allo recalls taking the position.
“I really believed that running a team was much better for me than just playing.
It will sound strange, because as a player I was doing well, I made good money and I achieved some measurable successes.
Playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure associated with the work of the coach, but I feel good in this role.
I’ve always wanted to coach others and now I do. I can say that right now I feel the most in place in my entire adult life.”

Research shows that the best time for a beer is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a sharp influx of customers into British pubs, but it rebounded with hiccups in restaurant chains.
The study showed that in July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, which developed the data, says: “Continued heat and longer than anticipated England’s participation in the World Cup resulted in July’s results taking shape similarly to June’s, when turnover in pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that restaurant earnings fell even more.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales in June in July has increased even further.
Pubs and bars were by far the best at offering drinks, with sales surpassing the decline in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered in the heat, though not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
Sales of beverages in managed pubs and bars increased this month by 6.6 percent, and food fell by three percent.”
Paul Newman of RSM, an entertainment and travel analytics company, said: “These results are in line with the trend we’ve seen since late April.
The most important factors influencing the size of consumption "outside the home" remain the weather and large sports or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are going through tough times is not surprising, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly dire consequences when you consider the ongoing pressures to cut costs.
The long and hot summer came at the most unfavourable time for food service owners, and time will tell whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring much-needed rest.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand development.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Research has shown that one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted on them.
Twenty Percent of Students Say They Have a “Main” Account That They Show Their Parents
One in five children —some as young as 11— set up social media accounts that they do not disclose to adults.
A survey conducted among 20 thousand students of secondary schools showed a rapid increase in the number of accounts "fake Insta" — the name refers to the service Instagram, where you can share photos.
The news has heightened concerns that these accounts are used to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students admitted to running a "master" account that shows parents, and they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, ran into a teenager who urged others to “rape her.”
A study conducted in independent schools by the Digital Awareness UK agency and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles. Half of them admit to maintaining private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are creating places online where neither parents nor teachers can find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” on the board of Scottish Athletics
At the annual general meeting of Scottish Athletics management, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most successful Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from her rich international experience she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that bringing her to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I’m very excited to be able to give the athletes’ council a voice, and I hope I can really help manage the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four Olympic gold medals has won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now regularly appears on the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was torture work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and returned to training!
Thank you for all your support!”
Lactator advertising that compares mothers to cows arouses extreme emotion on the Internet
A lactator company has sparked a storm on the internet by publishing an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To announce the launch of “the world’s first silent lactator to be worn under clothing,” its producer, Elvie, has released a mocking video ad that highlights the freedom it provides mothers.
It depicts four real mothers dancing in a hay-filled barn to a song in which the words are heard: "Yes, I milk, but I can't see the tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not just my tits that are swabbed."
The refrain goes like this: "Pump them, pump them, I will feed the children, pump them, pump them, milk my ladies."
The ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, caused great controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, with users expressing extreme opinions, many of whom say it is inappropriate to joke about the “horror” that is taking place in the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans, to give milk, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf, except that their babies are taken away from them a few days after birth," one user wrote.

Another commented: “This is obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
Sure, let’s use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can keep their babies.”
Someone else added: “This ad is completely detached from reality.”
Others defend the video — one of the women said that she thought the song was “fun”.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
When I was feeding, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I am not looking for a second bottom in it.
“It’s a great invention,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny advertisement for mothers who pull food away (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, it turns out that the women danced with lactators attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many breastfeeding women feel like cows.
Elvie’s breast milker, however, is completely quiet, has no cables or tubes and can be worn unnoticed under the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold babies in their arms, and even leave the house while pulling food.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Elvie’s lactator is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative premiere.
By combining nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to show you all the challenges of breastfeeding, while also presenting in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's milkman has made the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, during the show of Marta Jakubowski, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk with this product attached.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Secretly Moved to Camp on Texas Border
The number of detained immigrant children is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border each month does not change in fact. This is due in part to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and rules introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Most of the sponsors are also undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being deported if they apply for a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living on the joint farm would be fingerprinted and handed over to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had volunteered to sponsor unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously listed.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are sponsors or live with them in the same household are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That is why we are constantly chasing them,” Albence said.
Shelter workers say that as part of efforts to speed up the regulation of the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention — and not after 60 days, as was the case under previous standards.
Many will come forward via videoconferencing, not in person, to ask an immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for the exemption will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become restless or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbursts of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders found that these problems are even more serious in the case of larger centers, such as Tornillo, where due to its size, it is easier to overlook the signals that something is wrong with the child.
They added that moving children to a camp without giving them the right time to prepare emotionally or saying goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite the country’s eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “we will deal with them accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem says the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions forced to flee their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to “carry on its holy battle until the cleansing of Syria’s territory” from both terrorist groups and “all foreigners illegally staying there.”
Currently, about 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the country destroyed by the war.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “raising irrational fear” that discourages them from returning.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing matters that should have a purely human dimension.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad strikes a political deal with the opposition to end the war, Syria will receive no help to rebuild.
UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has a "clear time frame" and expressed hope that the military action will be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Levant People's Defense Front, who will be "eliminated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of members of the ruling party and the opposition soon to draft Syria’s post-war constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited to “verification of the provisions of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Election Again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected in 2020 for a second term unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency ends earlier with removal from office and scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency so far.”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s primetime viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers during peak hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” achieved the highest score on cable television, attracting as many as 3.5 million evening news viewers.
“People are flying like moths into the fire — that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, the lead producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” he replied.
“Chaos has entertainment value.”
Of course, reports from Washington, like nothing else shown on television, could rule on the future of the Roe v. Wade case, on the admissibility of immigrant family reunification or on the state of the world economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it’s not just about being a well-informed president when you watch an expert panel at six o’clock debating Bob Woodward’s use of secret informants when writing his book Fear, about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skinned jacket (“storks of garments overloaded with pride”), as The Post put it.
I’ll never see Super Mario like I did before.
“What he’s doing is in part like a reality show in that he delivers new content every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and daily turns of the show Trump (like attacking NFL players or praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna have a backlog.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai island, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he sat inside, watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn’t shake it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was being weighed down.
“I remember before we did all these crazy programs and people were saying ‘this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.”

Inflow of money from outside for the election campaign to Congress
Unsurprisingly, after the reorganization of the constituencies, resulting in the race for one seat now two current congressmen, a river of cash flows into Pennsylvania’s 17th constituencies.
This recently formed suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented in Congress by a Democratic representative, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania's former District 12, which largely overlaps with the new District 17.
The maps of the counties were corrected after the January Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old counties were designated unfairly, which gave an advantage to Republicans and was inconsistent with the constitution.
The race in the new District 17 began with a fight for campaign funding between the party’s main funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning by a hair in the widely commented election for the 18th constituency, which took place in March.
A Republican has been in that position for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won by 20 points.
Politics experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite Washington’s slight opposition.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and until the expulsion of the Trump Organization’s management team partners, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
The sanctions, however, were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017 to combat drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were to include restrictions on financial assistance and visas for certain people, would be very severe for this Central American country, which is facing high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to address the conclusions of a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, top-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus cutting off any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal to invite representatives of the administration to the assembly.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, not accompanied by any new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who, on condition of anonymity, agreed to discuss internal negotiations.
Their relationship was confirmed by an external analyst from the administration, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn the history
Another element could be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, for which there is currently concrete evidence available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller’s investigation also examines whether Donald Trump’s campaign had anything to do with Russia’s attack on the US election.
If Congress changes its composition, President Trump will be held accountable as he prepares to speak again to voters, and may even be tried by a jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don’t want to imply that the downfall of Trump – or those in his equal positions in Europe – is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will decide how long this can last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There are several such turning points ahead of the Americans now.
What will we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since we revealed in our newspaper that last year he offered a secret recording of the president and speculated that he was unfit for the office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the FBI’s newly commissioned investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed a Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?”
Above all, will we elect to Congress in the middle of the presidential term those who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, we will have a difficult time for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika-marked table.
With such a legacy, how can I not look to the future with optimism?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans looks forward to the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory with the Austrians, after an impressive draw with Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from Group G of the Europa League.
Up to a 2-2 draw with Villareal, a knee injury prevented assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes this result will work for the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
“It’s been good for us because Villarreal is in good shape,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something – and we scored a point.
Maybe we could have pushed them in the end, but in general, a draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will be able to score three points, but this match will be difficult, because our opponent got a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that with the support of fans we will pass and we will win a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a tough year because of everything about my injury and the changes at the club itself, but now we all feel good in our seats.
The team is great and the boys really like to play. Training goes well.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of retirement savings keeps women dreaming
Although those surveyed knew exactly how much they wanted to be taken care of, few talked about it with their family.
In a survey conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide, a life insurance company.
Where to start?
Talk to Your Spouse and Children: You will not prepare your family for self-care unless you express your will in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you want to be looked after, as this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for help from a financial advisor: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows you to withdraw cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property — if you have one.
Prepare legal documents: This will prevent court battles.
Appoint a trusted health care attorney to oversee it and make sure the right people act according to your will if communication becomes impossible.
Also, consider hiring an attorney who will handle the finances.
Choose a trusted person, because they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical help and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information so that you have it ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
It is worth having such a plan at hand.”
Man repeatedly shot with a wind gun in Ilfracombe
The man was repeatedly shot with a wind gun on his way home from an evening party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "accidental".
Victim didn't see the assailant.
The injuries suffered do not endanger the life of a man. The police ask for witnesses to report the incident.
Category: Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
Officials say at least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the interruption of communication, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala kabupatenu, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the Donggala kabupaten on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. It is estimated that in 2017 there were 379,800 people living there.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit below the province) stretching along the northwest coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the economy of the Central Celebes are fishing and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal kabupaten of Donggala.
Another source of income of the province are the nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morwali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, earthquakes and tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami that struck Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami in western Donggali killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismically active Pacific ring of fire, which is why earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that hit the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, the west coast of Sumatra was hit by a series of strong earthquakes.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, a 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck.
As a result, more than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya kabupaten in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the devastation caused by the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on its northern side.
They destroyed thousands of homes and brought temporary trouble to thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from Wasilla, Alaska, the 29-year-old was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstructing reporting and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of the suspect tried to call the police to file a crime report, he took her phone.
KTUU reports that Palin is in Mat-Su’s custody and has a $500 bail.
According to her information, he appeared in court last Saturday, where in his defense speech he stated that he was "certainly innocent".
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he can face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, which could result in a prison day and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His partner says he punched her in the face.
In 2016, groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder he developed while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds killed in tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of Friday's earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, there were hundreds of people on the beach in Palu, where the festival was taking place.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York demand the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment — it was not executed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bicycle path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck, which hit pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notice filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious injuries.
According to the court document, both of these charges face the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment covering 22 counts, including eight counts of murder as part of illegal activities — a procedure typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases — and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the organization of the attack required “solid planning and reflection”. The way Saipov conducted it, they described as “horrible, cruel and immoral”.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov brought harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca."
Five of the victims were Argentine nationals who were tourists in New York.
The last time the death penalty was applied for in the Southern District of New York was a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The death penalty as a result of a federal case was last executed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was executed after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the months following the attack.
Police say he told investigators that he felt comfortable with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
According to police, he also demanded that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
To the indictment, which includes 22 charges, he answers that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "for obvious reasons disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and the refusal of life imprisonment without the possibility of prior release after pleading guilty will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought on all concerned,” he said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Take Responsibility for Brexit Negotiations
During today’s protest, which took place during the Tories conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the army of the people.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must “feel the heat” from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage had been Brexit secretary, “the United Kingdom would already be out of the Union.”
However, joining Tories opting to stay in the community in a separate anti-Brexit protest held in the city further underscored the burden of reconciling their deeply divided ranks, which faces Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to carry out her plan to compromise with Chequers amid attacks from Brexit supporters, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Her allies say she will push for a deal with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her proposal and “chaos”.
Peter Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to “throw the plan out of Chequers.”
He suggested that Nigel Farage should become the proxy, who should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was doing this, we would be out of the EU now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw the plan out of Chequers.”
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “This is not why we fought in world wars, to be subordinate to someone.
We want to establish our own rights in our own country.”
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens had changed their minds since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory party, who backed Brexit, also took part in the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy popular support, the opposition will not vote for it, our party and our activists who populate the streets and who elected us do not support it either.
"Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening."
Speaking to Prime Minister May, she added: “Prime Ministers maintain their positions when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said politicians participating in the demonstration must "feel hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let you do that.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the verge of Brexit betrayal feel hot.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us the victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
During this time, opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved “Tory against Brexit” banners after forming the group this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis mocked the Conservatives for having security issues with the party’s app at the start of the conference.
“These are people who claim they can organize IT systems and all the technology to handle the Canada Plus, the smooth border, the free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Elizabeth Warren Plans to ‘Seriously Consider’ Candidacy for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
A Massachusetts Democrat spokeswoman told The Boston Globe about her future during a meeting with voters in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November. Her opponent will be Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is currently being said that in the 2020 election, Warren can beat Trump.
Saturday’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government — and he means the woman at the top.”
Arrest of the perpetrator of the deadly shooting in which LSU team player, Wayde Sims, was killed
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in Friday's shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson during a conference held at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released asking for help identifying the man.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims was killed in a shooting near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a gun and died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the crime scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge with a height of 1.98 m and played 32 games, finishing 10 times last season with an average of 17.4 minutes on the court, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets close to world title after team’s command enabled him to win against Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team’s order will have a major impact on the race outcome.
Bottas, who started from the pole position, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove to the service station first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the tail of the peloton, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes rider rolled into the pits in the next lap and showed up behind Vettel, but after a round-to-round action in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track, risking being pushed into the defensive after the rival’s double move to defend his position on corner three, Hamilton moved on.
Max Verstappen started from the end of the bet and at his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap he was in seventh place.
He then ran for much of the race because he did not change the tyres in order to make a quick finish and take away the fourth position from Kimi Raikkonen.
He finally reached the service point on lap 44, but in the remaining eight laps he was no longer able to accelerate. Raikkonen took fourth place.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me pass.
The whole team did their best to take the first two places,” said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
During a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianny Feinstein, who claimed she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford in which she accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Christina Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he stated that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “sneaky, mean and lying.”
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate that we have witnessed for several days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, mean and lying,” he said.
“We see what’s been published and disclosed, and then they tell us ‘oh, I didn’t do it.’
I didn't do it.
You remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you disclose that?
Memorize her answer... did you disclose the contents of that document?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t disclose it.”
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we disclose... No, we did not,” he added, mocking the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September. The senator denies that the source of the leak was her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s insinuation, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me for discretion and, at her request, I did not disclose this content.”
Her statement, however, did not convince the president, who commented on her during Saturday’s meeting: “I’m telling you, it was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, whom three women have accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats were using insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to seize power by all means.
You see meanness, malice, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to take power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants.
The Dundee Stars have atone for their Friday loss in the Elite League to the Belfast Giants, winning a 5:3 rematch at home on Saturday.
The giants quickly gained a two-gate lead after the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to the lead.
François Bouchard again equalized the score, scoring a goal for Dundee, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's underdogs, who, despite an initial loss on Friday night, won 2-1 against Dundee in Belfast.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season, with the Giants winning the first three games.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after assisting Kendall McFaul. Four minutes later, Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to David Rutherford.
After an intense opening at 13:10 minutes Sullivan brought the host team back into play, and then Matt Marquardt equalized the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he scored his second goal that evening at the end of the first third.
The home team was regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the goal scored during the game in the lead in the 27:37 minute.
At the end of the second third, Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen secure Dundee's first lead in the match. Dundee's final victory was sealed in the middle of the last third by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller is killed while helping hundreds of people on a plane escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he was killed helping take off the plane safely with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many were reported missing after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks continue to be felt in the area and many people have been trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was there to ensure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to ABC News, Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the controller’s decision likely saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We arranged a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan to Borneo to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This news has torn our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands. The National Disaster Management Agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We believe that the harvest of death continues to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Six-metre-long tsunami waves destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral for the victims will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly bringing in bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are being looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find on the ground.
It’s a tragedy, and it could be even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo, addressing the military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
This year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
Micronesia: Air Niugini says one person is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
Airlines operating the flight, which crashed on a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, reported that one person is missing. Previously, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said it could not count one man who was traveling on a jetliner on Saturday afternoon.
They said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island, local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew members.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six more passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the crash, and the exact course of the accident is unclear.
U.S. airlines and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon not far from the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off the waist.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was approaching very low.
“It helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said that he and other people managed to get through the water reaching to the belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to him, the crew members panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The United States Navy reported that the rescue operation was also assisted by sailors who were working nearby on the modernization of the coast. With the help of an inflatable boat, they managed to transport people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have died in the crashes of aircraft belonging to airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini is not among these airlines.
Analyst Reconstructs Events From Night When Woman Was Burned Alive
On Saturday, prosecutors completed the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as a forensic expert on information analysis.
He described to the judges how he used cell phone records to recreate the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he obtained location data from various mobile phones, which showed that the fair evening Tellis was with Chambers.
When the data confirmed that Quinton was with his friend, Michael Sanford, at the time of his testimony, his cell phone was with Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, he replied that “he was lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.”
Another inaccuracy is Tellis’s claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis removed her contact details, as well as texts and calls from her phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The final defense speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said the case would likely be handed over to a jury later that day.
The High Breed – what is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with a positive message.
According to Bristol-based band The High Breed, today’s hip-hop has moved away from the original political content and social issues.
The members of the band want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the UK has recently seen a revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common.
Another black one?
Nanny from New York sues couple for firing after ‘racist’ text message
A New York-based nanny sues a couple for firing her from a racist job after receiving an incorrectly addressed text message in which the child’s mother complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly perplexed when it was revealed that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who had quarreled on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NIEE, THE NEXT BLACK PERSON,” she wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to him, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman became aware of the misdemeanor, she fired Gisella Maurice, who was “embarrassed” by the fact that she was a warm-hearted nanny, who is African-American, who was not doing her job properly and was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day’s work and then sent home by Uber.
She is now demanding compensation for the couple’s $350 a day redundancy multiplied by the six months for which she was originally employed with residence, although she had not signed a contract.
“I want to show them that you don’t do things like that,” she told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denies the allegations of racism, arguing that ending the relationship with Ms. Maurice was justified because, after insulting her, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco, his husband, told The Post.
“Would you entrust your children to a person whom you have grieved, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to blow something like that?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, the public quickly issued a verdict on the couple on social media, criticizing her for her behavior and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that publishers of Paddington books feared that readers would not feel a connection with the talking bear
The author's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was warmly received, says of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book was published.
It’s very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She claims that her father, who before the little teddy bear inspired him to write a children’s book, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book’s release seems “sweet-bitter.”
Of Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he didn’t brag,” he adds.
“But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplished something—you feel proud of him, though it’s not your doing.
I think Paddington's success was seen in more or less this way.
Although he invented and created it himself, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly and said it was really bad, that he probably wouldn’t get over it,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to say that Natasha was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart working slowly stopped working and were excreted from her body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end of it.
All I could do was sit and wait and realise that it was all developing.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was with other people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded with the other passengers, unaware of the torments she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had my head down and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an overwhelming sympathy for Nada.
I felt that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards from mourning women are supposed to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide try to discourage others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said he could lighten up any room with it.”
Before his death, however, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place”.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old, and it was he who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m still afraid of the domino effect.”
Sharon Davis created the cards “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they’re just friends.
Don’t sit quietly — talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say anything about feeling down or sad or anything,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
By Christmas, he was in a complete hole. When the children opened the gifts, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to cope with it: “It tears a hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI launches an investigation
“I thought that if we could really get what he asked for — a time-limited and limited investigation — maybe we could reach some unanimity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “breaking up” into opposing camps, leading to a deadlock.
Why did Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters refuse to investigate the FBI?
All their reluctance stems from the moment.
The elections to Congress are in a few weeks — November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans lose, the chances of electing a certain person to the highest court in the country will be significantly reduced.
George W. Bush was already picking up the phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is unclear whether Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senators’ votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim the number of North Korean refugees is declining.
According to the South Korean legislator, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 escapes last year and 2,706 in 2011.
According to him, the key factors that influenced this situation are more accurate controls at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are eventually proposed South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the tightly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly sends them back to the country.
Relations between North and South, which are theoretically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on denuclearization negotiations, which had previously come to a standstill.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, held in June in Singapore. The fruit of this meeting is a general agreement on the effort to clean the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress on the issue.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh ‘Hysterical’ and Says He Is Unfit to Work at Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was intrinsically unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview she gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I think if a woman behaved this way, she would be considered ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times, during his opening remarks, Kavanaugh displayed intense emotion—almost screaming and losing his voice when discussing family matters and high school years.
He also blasted the committee’s Democrats, describing the charges against him as “a grotesque and coordinated assault on reputation” orchestrated by liberals furious that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony showed he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it exposed his bias toward Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
When asked if she would have sought Kavanaugh's removal from office if he had been nominated and if the Democrats had won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“If he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in the court where he currently works,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she fears Kavanaugh’s possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to bring to justice a hysterical, biased person who would expect us to say ‘how wonderful’,” Pelosi said.
And women have to rule it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of rampant fury, and she can't throw it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“That’s pretty common, isn’t it?”
She added: “I was tremendously helped by a woman who was a manager at a company. She said that she also cries when she’s angry, but she came up with a way that when she gets nervous and starts crying, she says to the person she’s talking to, ‘You probably think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm pissed.
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are acceptable as an outlet for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office was one time when I started crying out of unspeakable rage. An elderly woman —a cool manager who I was always a little afraid of— grabbed me by the neck and led me onto the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, and they’re happy that they’ve touched you.”
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a Colorado congresswoman, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a mistress on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated Patricia realized that she could actually consider running for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone described the situation as 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'"
As the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder had a backlog of fundraising and promised herself that she would not start the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
She then discovered that some of her followers, who gave men $1,000, had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?” she asked.
In her speech announcing that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion—gratitude to those who supported her, frustration over a system that made it so difficult to raise money and turn to voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism—that her voice was stuck in her throat.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” she recalls the reaction of the press.
“You might think I’m being sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
'Crying?'"
What the economic war between the United States and China could bring to Beijing
The booms that started the U.S.-China economic war were daunting, and while the battle is still going on, in the long run, the conflict between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
The first warning this year was fired by US President Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came after the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $ 200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3> 150 billion), which resulted in taxation of half of all goods entering the US from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in kind, recently raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. strike, and it doesn’t look like the world’s second-largest economy is about to recede.
Forcing Washington to retreat means accepting the demands, but bowing your head publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say if Beijing plays its cards well, pressure from the trade war with the US could strengthen China in the long run, reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision made in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to unleash economic chaos in one country is actually much more dangerous than observers have so far admitted,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syrian Foreign Minister Says ‘Ready’ to Return Refugees
The government says Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving.
“The situation on our territory is now more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and means of subsistence can voluntarily return to the country.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to help rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid conditional on or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was not doing well for most of the tournament, hit the ball straight from the stand into the water at the 16th hole PAR3, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all rounds and became one of four players who managed to score 5-0-0 since 1979, the first time this tournament was held in the current format.
Jordan Spieth was eliminated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world rankings, lost two holes before the last hole with Englishman Ian Poulter, for whom it may already be the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the most wins in the Ryder Cup was the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who took part in eight such tournaments and earned 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
It’s a success for the whole team and I’m delighted to be able to help,” Garcia said after the team’s victory in Europe.
He passes the baton to his countryman, John Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a single game on Sunday with a 2&1 score.
“I feel an incredible pride in winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all matches in France and now has a score of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and was second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the treadmill throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance by the American line-up, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we were pressuring some Europeans.
We've retreated.
The hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
Together with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I am full of admiration for my opponents.
They played much better than us.”
