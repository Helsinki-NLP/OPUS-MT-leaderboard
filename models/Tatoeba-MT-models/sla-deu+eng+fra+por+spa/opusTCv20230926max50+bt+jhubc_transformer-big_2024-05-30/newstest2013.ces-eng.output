The Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, describes such fraud as a myth, saying that electoral fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after being struck by lightning.
Republican lawyers have reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the U.S. over the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 that hamper the process of election or listing.
This phenomenon saw an upsurge after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican deputies were added in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were submitted restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for early elections, invalidate the right to register on the voters' list on the day of the elections and deprive citizens with a criminal record of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of Indian law was confirmed in 2008 by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this procedure to other states.
Over the past two years, drafts of such laws have been passed in 34 states to force voters to submit photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not own any photo ID issued by their state government office.
In addition, it does not have such an identity card for about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, obtaining the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with incomes below $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their preference for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who elect rather Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required a proof of citizenship for elections.
The first such requirement was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about 12 states have enacted laws that make it mandatory for voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers backed laws in eight states that abolished voter registration on election day.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to enroll.
These limitations have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% drop in new voter enrolment in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans made up 33% of voters who voted in advance, even though there were only 13% of African-American voters in that state.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting ahead of time.
On the other hand, whites, who represented 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have, of course, strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, even the U.S. Attorney General intervened.
The damage was partially reduced.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the newly introduced rules will undeniably complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics primarily talk about the bias of the laws passed and see them as an obvious attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states where these laws were passed accounted for 171 of the 270 votes in the electorate needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain already today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test sometimes yielded erroneous results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this further increased the hesitation of men who were already so reluctant to go to the examination at all.
To be examined or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the U.S. showed a high level of contamination between the individual groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a difference in mortality rates between patients who underwent the examination and those who did not.
The study also found that those who did not undergo the test had a 30 to 40 percent higher risk of metastasis.
Therefore, I recommend testing from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your immediate relative has prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and those that are inactive.
Therefore, it is necessary to correctly explain to the patient the level of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which does not have a long-term impact on life, and in these cases, rather to focus on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are untreated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
Rather, we will suggest that they carry out active surveillance and offer them treatment in case of disease progression.
Increasingly, and with greater precision, we set criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not.
Nevertheless, I recommend that you take the test.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, Movember has developed a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevention of diseases
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle principles seems to be the best way to reduce disease risk.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and exercised enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes inheritance.
Some percentages are also unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes are responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said André Beaulieu.
An encouraging figure: 10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
Weight (kg)
Body and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research suggests that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout life," the report adds.
Nutrients
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid sausages, for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet yielded conclusive conclusions.
Studies focused on vitamin E are contradictory according to the SCC.
Although one of them says it will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study suggests an increase in prostate cancer.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on the importance of discussing his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"Being tested doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
The Higgs Boson
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And then there is the last particle, the existence of which is predicted by the standard model - our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
Physicists are not 100% sure that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week at the great physics congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but all the data are still lacking so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, let's assume it's the Higgs boson, because the risk of error seems small, and let's look at what it is.
In this world there is an absolutely indisputable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule can not be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
In addition, it divides physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently follow the Pauli principle.
And at the other end, there are the bosons, the mean anarchists who don’t appreciate anything at all – certainly not this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the mesons, which we leave here unnoticed, and the "force particles", through which great forces of nature are propagated, and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow related.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is because of a boson with unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "interferes" with the electromagnetic field at that particular place, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "interference" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) arises, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons, the "force carriers".
A more stable field
It is the same with the Higgs boson, except that it takes a different field, the Higgs field, to "disrupt" the boson.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen level of the pond, which only a very large boulder will become.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as the CERN accelerator - a large hadron beam accelerator is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for clarifying the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Neither all particles nor all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on the refrigerator.
And it is equally true that not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let's look at it) do not.
And Mrs. Nováková asks, what is all this research for, what will it “bring to us”?
From the point of view of science, it is a validation of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between observations and SM predictions.
In addition, many physicists literally want to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and fill some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge flaws, it does not bring any clarification of gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the cosmic mass (ouha! again).
So far, however, CERN has not found any such discrepancies.
Responses
The responses of these researches in the daily life of Mr and Mrs Novák can be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
See: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution their work would bring about.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a "toy for the lab".
Just imagine it...
And besides, the application can also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although not originally planned by Boyle, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it means that one never really knows...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... <0x7C> Le Devoir
Through its Commission for Dignified Dying, Quebec has recently become involved in the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should continue soon, while a bill is being drafted.
Much work remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monterrey.
Prostate cancer, which was feeding him, gave him a two-year delay.
"They've given me five years to live and it's been seven," he says without emotion on his bed in Victor-Gadbois's palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he added.
The disease has done its work: an immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet alone or just eat on his own.
He resignedly looks at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by him, brings him medicines, offers him a bath.
Courage to die a simple death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," she confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"You learn all your life that men pee standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
To return to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the person," the psychologist says, whether he accepts the return.
In the opinion of many palliative care practitioners, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients entering the home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who take care of them does not provide them with so-called "treatment" care.
In the case of Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “of suffocation in full consciousness.”
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he added.
"I don't have any wishes in my life anymore," she says, and then she agrees to have her breathing apparatus put on.
However, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the coming days.
At Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, body care with the help of nutrition is provided.
This is what palliative care looks like when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one bed of palliative care per 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, you can give them, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi, to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to control their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
They brought beer to Mr. X last night, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of his deceased father.
“We help patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
At Victor-Gadbois, the days go by, but they don't resemble each other.
Next to a 93-year-old man who rejoices at his last meeting with his family, thoroughly grounded on pillows, while a toast is given to him in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically surrounded by his parents, wife, and two young children after trying every possible way to survive.
"For six months now, there have always been three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer under 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is designed to alleviate suffering as soon as a sick person reaches the final stage of his or her life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental unavailability of health care in Quebec that has led many physicians specializing in palliative care to fear the passage of the Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide Act.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by leaders in the field of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before they can agree to euthanasia.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the ER in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients will not be asked to be killed because they are not receiving proper care.
And at the same time, many oncologists care for their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already quite minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she told us that she regretted that I had stopped fighting.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when a team of palliative pussy relieved their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montréal area, patients resist pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either by shock or by being given sedatives permanently.
It is impossible to pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who is not relieved of pain will have more and more access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to give me euthanasia,” it means rather “I want you to relieve my pain.”
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Road administration officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing “system” in which the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mobsters mix.
This "field" came to Quebec taxpayers very dearly especially between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has broken down since we took major action,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former police chief in Montreal.
It led to a scandal in 2011 following a rigorous investigation into embezzlement of funds in connection with Quebec’s road construction contracts, which the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after long delays.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party financing and corruption of government officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he says, “only the Department of Transportation has saved a billion dollars on procurement,” as some people have kept their instincts to get a share in it!
Charbonneau’s commission has “already led two mayors to resign,” he added, hoping to “uncover the cunning of some people.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
Established in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit also engages in combat with its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, police officers of the "Marteau's company", who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "cartel of money-traders" significantly alleviates the inflating of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and charged a number of municipal deputies with fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just stepped down as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have also been filed against Montreal-based transport engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when he explained to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of procurement.
During these years, he himself donated 3% of the value of the contracts he had acquired in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was running.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and donated more than C$88,000 (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to organizing illegal fundraising for former liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with cash-traders whose prices exceeded
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in great detail before the commission: over the course of ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with cash ducts, for which he exaggerated the price.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had been paid for overvaluing invoices by 30% to 40% through false multiple jobs.
The mayor’s party organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of unabashedly turning a blind eye to the parallel budget that was bringing dirty money into his treasury.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montréal into a widespread crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first MEPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been campaigning since 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of the money in election campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says he is "pulling the strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the system imbibed by ants to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
The process is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but we need to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these dubious practices cannot be reversed.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "deputies informed of this deceit" if they have not gotten themselves into this mess!
He estimates that 70% of Quebec’s election campaign funding comes from dirty money, and ironically adds: “I’ve heard that it’s just a weak decoction of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not solve the situation: “Until election spending is severely reduced, dirty money will not disappear from politics.”
He proposes a comprehensive review of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We can no longer go down; if we focus boldly on the essence of things, we can rebuild on a firmer foundation and with more control and respect for the law."
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that anyone who mocks him take a look at his own backyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
You’ve set a whole new pace with PSG this season.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all the individuals have gone together, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players have come to us.
Every day I get closer to them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
It is easier in matches.
In football, everything goes so fast.
I'm not losing my head.
From my training at INF Clairefontaine to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved up the ranks.
So you are taking advantage of the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The reinforcements from this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give maximum performance.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the decisive word at the right time?
Sure. Sure.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today he has no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won many titles with top teams.
He also worked with great players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust it gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you see the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our lead.
We stay in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it to the eighth final very easy.
What is your club’s goal in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough competitor for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Port first so we can play in the rematch of the eighth final at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
For Paris to become a great European club, it has to win titles and go down in history.
This is not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to achieve this goal.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed it a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you are a clear master of...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it will be successful this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to win, I think we have the weapons to beat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is not uncommon to expect a lot from us given what has been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is that if we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there is still something in the newspapers that reproaches us, it is not very pleasant.
You ask yourself what else people might want from you.
Of course, you can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
It takes time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we have proven that we can play.
Take a look at Manchester City, which hasn’t made it to the finals for the second season yet has invested a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, you could expect to be ahead of the other 15 points!
This offends other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille, which did not do well last season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the Premier League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.
PSG seems to be relying on Zlatan Ibrahimovic for everything.
It is good that it is said that there is "addiction to Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's a League One star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both the individual and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly extraordinary.
This led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to injury, I couldn’t play as well as I imagined.
But I've experienced it, and I've come out stronger.
I’m also good at playing games today.
This is what I have been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our performance exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in qualifying for the World Cup.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can excite for victory.
And so was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the 1-1 draw in Spain a solid starting point?
This game gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never seen such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, You Can Sell and Pay Without Banks
All negatives of current central bank based financial transactions, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), represents both virtual money (convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first peaked at $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, five months later it dropped to $2, today it is around $10 (an overview of the exchange rates can be found at bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the global exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin has been described as “the most successful virtual money”, “competing the dollar and the euro” and “the era of ordinary money”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like “credits” used to advance in a video game that a person gains through a game or can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are depository books of current accounts, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, ensuring anonymity.
The file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key stage lies in the entry of this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving a mathematical problem assigned to computers, the solver of which, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is the stage of file slicing; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then "cut" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific footprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then be displayed indelibly linked to the string of all other transactions; any modification would change the fingerprint.
If the user wants to pay twice with the same money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different footprint.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they can be divided up to a hundred million, so there is room for margin.
The difficulty of a given task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been compromised and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
“The exploited gap is not about the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB is also checking the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Notable players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the current account book and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to convert bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up for traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and transition to more horizontal systems.
“It’s going to take a while before Bitcoin takes hold, but 2013 could be a decisive year,” he predicts.
In addition, the ECB’s report foresees a reassessment of various risks that are now considered heightened if this type of money is successful.
We've left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside, whom we punished because we considered terrorists, suffered the greatest damage.
And we too, after all, we lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all those wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often they are peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks have joined them.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the peaks of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, was neat.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by helicopters.
From the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable progress between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their taking control of the land was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the gloom of these peasants who have been completely dominated by al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved by our time.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban all agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The chief dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became traffickers, seized state lands they sold as building lands to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and took advantage of huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them had never been in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that's not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave in the same way that those who have been able to take advantage of America’s generosity leave: capital flight is significant.
Young people are tired of war and the ideologies associated with it.
During their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they learned about the modern world and its benefits impressed them.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, loves mobile phones; TV and Turkish TV shows that show the modern world, they watch everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand in front of it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militias that will be beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a degree of decentralization modeled on Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been able to rebuild, no dam is functioning, no essential irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumors have spread that Afghanistan possesses enormous mineral wealth.
And this only fueled the feeling that the Western states were only here to seize it.
Without energy for the processing of iron ore or copper on site and without the means of transporting raw materials through the mountains, no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine and have given international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist site to preserve their role as the most prominent employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of both imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The retreat of the French troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls' and boys' lyceums, departments of French at universities, the French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "to win heart and soul" has been working on the difficult task of reconciling aid and military activities, in which the service of "civil-army steps" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but has achieved a number of successes in the field of common interest thanks to a few French NGOs.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped to quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of arable land.
What memories will we leave behind after spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion on the military?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often located at altitudes above 2 000 m.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the insurrections led by foreign groups, these farmers, they say, wish to obtain a small amount of civil aid in their favor, which would be properly controlled and directly affect them.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohamed Morsi is playing another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the promulgation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play the puppet.
On Wednesday, he announced, irrespective of the views of everyone else, that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text the following day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted the Assembly two more months to complete the necessary work.
Egypt has been using a provisional text for nearly two years, which has been supplemented many times, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal controversy.
This new initiative only further strengthened the country's fragmentation.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium", continues to "violate his word" and "trodden the law".
However, his supporters assure him that this is a means of dealing with the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and of speeding up the transition process.
A referendum is to be held in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time, which will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify article by article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy while the whole country is rocked by protests.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for him.
Especially since this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: "Either you approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers", which should otherwise end with the approval of the new constitution.
And in this particular atmosphere, 85 MPs of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were absent.
In mid-November, not long before the promulgation of the constitution, they slammed the door, saying that they had no opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have emulated their move.
In order to reach a quorum, 11 alternates were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further paused on the fact that one of the few disputes of the day revolved around... the hour of prayer, when some members of the committee were of the opinion that the hours in the meeting room were not properly set.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental demands, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the liberals object, who see it as merely a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular on issues of checking the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because “persons called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This is the beginning of the theocracy.”
Liberal concerns are further fuelled by the fact that the university’s next rector should be less moderate than the current one.
“So far, there has been no concrete religious effect.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulams, but university workers, many of them graduated from French schools," Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a paper on constitutional transition in Egypt, said.
However, he agrees that "there may be controversy over the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious vocabulary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science].
And in the future, the question may arise of the extent to which civil judges are competent to make their views known.”
The text approved yesterday, in addition to religious pages, is highly criticized because of the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that they have been severely curtailed compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers vested in the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the military, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, proceedings against civilians will not be prohibited in military courts, as requested by human rights associations.
These associations talk about their doubts in connection with the text, which they say is directed against freedom.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insulting continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
No article deals with the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture laid down in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to make a televised speech last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the navel of the world and the sea from a saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the virginity of nature.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worship the holy places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will descend on all who enter this “bath.”
And Galilee - the place of the miracles of Jesus: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here will pass the Way of Pain, or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the judgment took place, it passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - the place of crucifixion, the anointing stone and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian belly button of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place for Jews – the Wailing Wall, a remnant of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different faiths here leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Embark on a journey through the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are involved in mountaineering can get to it by their own forces.
The rest will be taken to this historic mountain by cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists to this ski paradise from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You can’t visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judean desert, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
Also worth a visit is the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
His canvases are widely represented by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Spa Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figurines of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum – the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv – tells the story of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You will enter - and you will find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are glittering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improving your health
Israel's three major spa resorts are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it is possible to swim even in the winter months, because the temperature of the water in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest land point of the planet - at the level of 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps even people who can not swim afloat.
The surrounding countryside is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment with the use of salt water - brine, and curative mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure the damaged nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through them.
References to this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they then lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love wandering through narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you cling to the walls in the alley of "your" sign, luck will favor you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not need to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For the trip, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
Buses are the main mode of transport, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and the city of Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper one.
Basically, it's an underground cable car.
Traveling by all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive for 1.5 hours with a change of seats.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, the market, shops and public transport stop working.
On Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you will only get kosher food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that contain combinations of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus porridge, various types of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fattened cats that gracefully "wander to their liking".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Precursor cats love crowded places and are eager to engage in every delicacy.
Renting a car will cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And renting a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To explore the country and relax came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the promised land, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" announces it to Moscow: emigrants save money on language
While lawmakers and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language exams, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling "counterfeit" certificates
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, a law came into force that would require every working migrant to pass a Russian language test.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipality, lifestyle and retail sectors.
However, the FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the basics of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and renew a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply even to people who successfully achieved attestation and obtained an academic diploma before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, conviction and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship among Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by deputies of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask in the press many times the question: and what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for visitors themselves?
Thus, first of all - according to representatives of the migration service - this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labor".
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise among emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language, the future migrant is doomed to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide a "voucher" to the terrible, cramped hostels in which he and dozens of others like himself will suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland, they promise them one thing, but when they arrive, they cheat them, seize their passports, they do not pay the promised wages," confirms the head of the Main Tajik Department of Labor Migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't bully me!
All the less so because many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get to, but they do not even have experience with the work in question.
Of course, it’s not so much their fault as their misfortune: very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least an adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, shod and equipped for school.
As children reach productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the Law on Language Examinations, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will be carried out only on those migrants who have a legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't take the exams, and they won't get any more official jobs.
In the meantime, most migrant workers are living in Russia as illegally as before.
"Welcome, unauthorized entry is not prohibited"
Many of the incoming workers claim that it is not easy to get official status in our country.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization, in addition, costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police officers know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They demand a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Chuskadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters about his experience.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that not only migrants’ registration documents are false.
FMS employees have already seized several false language exam certificates.
Counterfeit documents are printed on an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to facilitate the problem with passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times higher than passing the official test: it will cost the migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task in the near future is to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, government officials and human rights defenders agree.
So far, government authorities can promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time the time they need to take a course in the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not take into circulation illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legally held weapons is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia is proposing to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of the government authorities to recent events: the shootings at weddings, which went without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people, were the trigger.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age from which a license to carry weapons can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that changes to the gun law will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand a rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, in six months of 2012 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while in the same period a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons will not induce the perpetrator to move to the "black" market.
According to them, at present, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior says that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers of: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years at the Department of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept orders for weapons
The first of them - "army or military way", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and Caucasians themselves," Baranec said.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal "mainly" go on sale from military warehouses.
Explosions often occur in many military depots.
"It has been proven that some fires were started deliberately - to cover up the flaw," the former soldier said.
According to Barance, the arms manufacturers are also making their contribution.
“Currently, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive on the international market, and they are eliminating weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow,” he said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are made in small-scale production, and a mafia was formed that organized their smooth production," the former soldier explains.
Where'd the gun come from?
Experts have summarized the approximate share of the various sources of supply of illegal weapons to the “black” market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons found themselves on the black market “by officials whose work is linked to weapons,” the report said.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there was theft of weapons during their manufacture, 5% is "black archaeology".
A salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" have long since been bought by anyone - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Through the Ensign, the interested party buys a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him and he sells it over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it there for 900 euros for a piece with two magazines," he says.
“The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever their plan to clarify crimes starts to burn, they will carry out check purchases from illegal arms dealers,” the adviser adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy showed up and offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Test" platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to the "corner" where we would negotiate together.
I learned the price from there.
Military Rapporteur Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman - a consultant.- I have such a friend, but I do not fully trust him.
There are sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell him that his daughter lost a tooth."
And now I'm going to get there through a man I'm sure of.
He will also deliver them only to me, because he knows that I will not give him up.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was processing a stand for publication on this topic.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
They gave him a photo album with "everything you thought about."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c, is not offered a rabbit in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just do not buy - we go with the seller in the woods and build a target.
"They give me the ability to shoot, and when I am convinced that the gun shoots well, we begin to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Tray on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will lead you to the website and groups on "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or face-to-face meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising headline on the website "Buy a combat pistol or a machine gun".
On this site, users leave their notices and ask questions.
Selling to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling is preserved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently raided a huge network of embedded websites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can grab it with a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military Reporter and Senior Military Officer Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment through the ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO Right to Weapons.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When you buy an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will usually pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the non-governmental organization “Right to a gun” you will get a pistol Makarov for $ 100 to $ 300.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
Weapons are shipped from warehouses for long-term storage through middle cell warehouses.
According to the official statistical office, compared to the period January - October 2011, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7%, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and blackmail of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers on strike in the US
Working at the cash register of the "McDonald" will pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen in America against low wages in Walmart’s hypermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave, or whether it is destined to soon disappear.
This action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the modest salaries that regular workers at Walmart and in fast food systems receive, the goal of protest organizers is to achieve the formation of their unions in them.
At present, this economic sector is practically untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called “Black Friday”, when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, swept millions of residents, and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their workplaces and demonstrated with unions and left-wing activists at multinational retailers whose goods are intended for the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage Walmart shoppers only shop at work.
Availability and assortment of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply, partly because it pays its employees little.
They also complain of poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic trolleys or hand-held scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker receives $9.5 per hour, but that doesn’t match the amount of expenses, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, show that if Walmart raises its average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
That’s an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves wage increases fully to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should cause virtually no harm to the company.
The “Black Friday” in the company’s stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
In total, its cash registers carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
In an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post, Dan Fogelman, a spokesperson for Walmart, said that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was "another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"Unoccupied Treasury!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they targeted not Walmart stores (they are not very popular in the aforementioned progressive city, and therefore almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn’t even pay you sick leave and doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Councillor
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the state of New York is $ 7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants gradually raise this salary, but only slightly, and on average their regular workers in New York receive $ 8.90 per hour.
No one has a lower salary in this expensive city.
I don't understand how you can live in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teenagers who work behind the counter after school part-time and live with their parents go through a job at McDonald’s.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
Nowadays, I constantly meet in interviews with McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children from it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs at fast food businesses start receiving at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the formation of trade unions and punishing trade union activists with bullying and firing.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
However, the introduction of trade unions in fast food establishments is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high turnover of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, loud protests were also held in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the event was a noon rally at McDonald’s near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, notably city councilman Jumaane Williams, spoke out, saying, “McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn’t even pay you sick leave and doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!”
The protesters also garnered support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must stand together to support fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair reward for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people attended it, though not all of them were fast-food workers who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flames of the mass movement is unclear.
"So far, the brain is able to deceive on average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies, the topic of augmented reality is popular; lately, this means perceiving the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a working model of the novelty, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for the patent.
An interview with Sharam Izadi, head of the Interactive 3D Technology Group at Microsoft’s Cambridge Laboratory, shows that glasses are a thing of the past for the company’s scientists.
The perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces is tempting.
- Please tell us what your research group is working on.
- We deal with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity is stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect pickups - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect pickups, because for everyone there is a very interesting option to control with gestures.
- What's next for us in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not yet been separately.
We are trying to change that, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, for this purpose, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add to the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- Surely it can not be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our surroundings about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interactions with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about flamboyant ones, only about such skinny, short ones.
The gesture would not be taken with the camera of the device, but with a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How, for example, do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to tell.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or cannot do at a given moment?
- That's not necessary, but it's a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a fairly good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Basically the current generation - this is what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
With the current view of the matter, all the current technologies are insufficient for us - this gives the job to algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolutions in the X and Y axis, but also the Z axis.
So speed, the number of frames per second, is also very important.
Human movement is quite dynamic and current data flows of 30 frames per second are frankly a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes of our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human-machine interaction.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful in my work, I just do not need so many touches, but I need some extra frames per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of a reflected signal.
And the third camera - this is actually a common visible bandwidth sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or worsen it, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect system, play with the curvature of the camera location, and see how this will help determine the three-dimensional position.
If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present their glasses.
Do you not think that this is one of the most promising platforms when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful option would be a "portable" form of reality expansion, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, there is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
Hands can't feel anything!
What are your group’s responses to this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could well be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a kind of background for imaging.
It records compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tactileness to these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located, evokes a tactile feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on the belly of your fingers.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you ever tried to fool your brain?
To make him think that he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that before.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for for a long time - how to make a person who is physically in a very confined space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If deceiving the brain becomes a target, then the work is still for many years to come.
That’s what makes virtual reality work so appealing to researchers—many things are in their prime.
Vkusovo language instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already prominent figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, without reaching all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable pubs and at openings.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a conspicuous man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being an urban man, his appearance in the streets causes a smile on the faces of citizens, raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took a bottle and became a St. Petersburg bottler, as he matured into this complex role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking around the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise?
- I chose the red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the image maker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that differs from gray only slightly awakens aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at initiating a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is above all an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understood what my way was.
It was then that the wave of old unofficial free artists passed, and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the artists of the new wave, the post-Gazonov artists, who led us to the Pushkin 10, and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to theater, dressing, music, to all genres except the word.
- And it all came together in your art-clinic ...- For me it was important to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995 I took a place on Pushkinska 10, and there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, home of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
There was a lot born:NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how Cord was brought with the project "Ear of Van Gogh".
Cord and his friends sang under the plywood of light songs, dressed in matching leotards, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, that’s how his great career began, he got his basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the echo of the Art Clinic.
This is where our working and regular guests left.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press, a special prize was "People in our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named, that was the end of my peak.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In modern years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are distinctive in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which the topicality and penetration is captured live.
I'm going to have a program exhibition called "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but nowadays being so is painful and awful.
But in clowns, everything is erased, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the decree.
Nowadays, people meet by clothes, they focus on the external mechanics, not the internal man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and you need to spit in his face.
And deception will be eliminated by disguise.
- We saw you in the role of the city bottler recently. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial, applied art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
Previously, people gathered in crowds, the bohemian loved one, simple other people.
Today, everything has broken down on micro-companies, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Nowadays, you have to think about who you like.
Nowadays, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov will have a few thousand spectators!
- It's coming up to the fans, and that's where the sexual social sphere comes into play.
And 300 people come to cultural land and 10,000 of them don't come, and the result is less management, less money, everything fades away.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one deceives them and does not break what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that one collector had hanging on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end with.
Nowadays, people often confuse concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it is from elsewhere.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejecting money because of drawing paintings.
I am for that culture.
Cyril, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: the official through culture.
However, not everyone can do culture.
In the days of the proper tsars it was not so in everything, the tsars perhaps did not understand much about culture, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Here in St. Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in a corner, because there is a need for great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, the taste buds are flourishing.
The same Erarta, but differing in that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg - this is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And in our eel, art thrives poorly.
We need cultural ground, but today we have more writers than readers, that is wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the funds of the St.Petersburg grant
Born in Space
The country is in jeopardy.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board set out on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in the conditions of weightlessness or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think there's much to choose from.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute (SAIS).
While Mars has better conditions for life, Venus's surface has temperatures of up to 500 degrees Celsius.
Living there is only possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the problems of reproduction in the universe began scientists with the flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments on plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their terrestrial relatives.
After that, an insect was carried out into orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to test how an embryo develops in a weightless state.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that this bird has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN.
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaotically and make curlers.
After 10 hours, the freshly hatched birds lost their instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, within four days, they were dead.
"We had birds hatched twice, but then we refused because it is simply impossible to work with them there," commented Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarca" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
The biosatellite "Bion" will only be of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were already being sent into space pregnant.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on Earth, space rats were born offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a difficult task.
Animals at the loss of the usual environment simply can not realize their sexual instinct.
Humans, unlike animals, can.
Homo sapiens dominates abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, no such experiments are carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was Tereshkov.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman’s body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive a flight into space.
Whether she can give birth to a child after such a flight.
“No one has answered that question yet,” said Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the space flight, the first female astronaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savicka was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few astronauts who after many years were born and grow healthy offspring.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must inevitably look for new pathways in the fields of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK water laboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here in zero-attraction conditions, astronauts learn the habits needed to work in open space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although for adults water is a comfortable, but in a way strange environment, for young children it is a natural element.
The little Ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first redemption, only 2 weeks pass.
"That's very little for a child to forget something," says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short - if for a newborn baby the state of weightlessness is a more natural state, then for women the inevitable gravity, the attractive force, is more natural.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the pelvic muscles, weaken very quickly, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases.
We can put that aside if the muscle stimulators work during childbirth.
After all, it is possible for childbirth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"What next?" asked Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the body is not affected by earthly attraction, it cannot properly form the skeleton or muscle system.
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit as an adult in a special suit with a load in which to train.
He will simply be deprived of what he unconditionally needs for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows a child to be born in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," predicts the head of the bioethics commission of IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
But there will come a time when it will become a reality and the Earthlings will embark in their ships on a distant planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
The head of the SAO: the control of the quartz system failed because of the politicians
The Czech Republic has good regulators and high-quality legislation in relation to public procurement, but it is lacking in its application.
In an interview with Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, said this.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what we think is missing," Kala said.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of bad practice, Peter Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' approach to the so-called "svarcsystem" is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with its controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law has to be set somehow, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of the office, which has the duty to monitor and enforce duties," Kala says.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was that about?
This is a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, the European legislation regulates how public contracts are dealt with, followed by individual national legislation and then by the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the inspection is not yet completed, we have seen very interesting differences - in general, the legislation in our country is perhaps even "tighter and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Efficiency means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But by lowering the procurement limit, we do not necessarily achieve this.
Perhaps the system will be so overwhelmed with paper that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw on it much more easily than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As far as the offices are concerned, just as the SAO operates there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly to us, also has a college, it is only formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices proceed in a similar way.
The powers are also similar to some extent, but because Germany has a federal system, it also has these courts of account at the level of individual federal states - in this the system differs a little from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
The public funds administered by the counties and municipalities in our country are checked there from the level of the federal accounting courts.
As far as the legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany is referred to as a model, but it is not certain that it is better in everything.
Is it because they have better controls?
Certainly not, but again, I don't like comparisons.
But it must be said that even countries that we consider to be role models face a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would be of no benefit to them to cooperate with our office, would it not?
As for the domestic legislation, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean for your office, are its effects already manifested in some way?
Due to the fact that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it does not yet manifest itself in our control actions.
Since we do ex-post checks, there is a certain delay to be reckoned with.
We are only observing this in the process of preparing future checks - we have launched our new tool for "detection of risks of inefficiencies", through which we have run almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analyzed them - there, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tenders will be adjusted, and so on.
So do you see the adoption of this law as more of a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that the rules will be "tightened" and it will not be possible to comply with them.
Already for the operation of the previous rules, the audited persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth it to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit a formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road leads.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controlling the so-called "swarz system" - and what does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
After all, the law has to be set somehow, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of the office, which has the duty to monitor and enforce duties.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and allow it," but he can't say that we're going to act like nothing.
There are fairly strict rules in the Public Procurement Act on how to formally do what is right to protect competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what is lacking in our opinion.
Roads are frosty in some places, but most of the time they are movable.
In several parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
But most of the roads are movable, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovarsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj
In the Karlovy Vary Region, the roads were accessible this morning, but in some places they were frozen and also snowy.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
There was also lower visibility due to fog, according to the data of the regional traffic controllers.
The R6 highway and first-class roads are now unrestricted in the region.
However, caution is appropriate, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On them, however, in some sections still lie the remains of frozen and sometimes drifted snow.
Particularly in higher positions, increased attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia, there is a risk of frost, in higher positions and in the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the roads, the Directorate of Roads and Highways reports on its website.
Road drivers warn drivers of frost, it can be formed especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice region.
Ice can be in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, especially on second and third class roads.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy.
Snow is mainly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and Eagle Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia today, it is most often clear to semi-clear without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a light wind blows.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are accessible this morning, but with increased caution and driving, the weather needs to be adjusted.
It is freezing in the morning, temperatures vary between three to nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some roads may be frozen.
The driver must also take into account the fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the regional traffic controllers.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, however, increased caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Pilsen and Tachov region, however, there may be frostbite.
Second- and third-class communications are damp and also in this case the warning of frosty sections applies.
Drivers should be especially careful on less frequented roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Today, drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region must count on snow pulp on the road.
After chemical sprinkling, she remained on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
The road workers were driven into the field by snowfall at night, in the <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk region, according to road managers, about three centimeters of snow.
In other parts of the county, roads are usually unrestricted.
"In the <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk region there are snow residues in the highest positions.
With snow pulp on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské saddle, drivers have to count in the direction of Jeseník," the dispatcher of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk Road Administration told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Their colleagues also set out to Jesenice at night, the roads to the highest position are now, according to them, bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, roads are unrestricted, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in forest areas where roads have remained damp.
<0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
Several hard-to-run places are reported this morning by road traffickers in northern Bohemia.
In addition to several places with snowfall or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem is closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are kept even in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow probably last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Middle Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported mainly by roadmen from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for her at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night clear and frost.
Unfavorable conditions are reported on the road I/13 on the border of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec Region.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent branches of trees that bent down to the road under the snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we humans like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts towards the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to your readers?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, at 9 p.m., 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially, it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to accumulating enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original wreaths against the end of the world, which people can also support by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other artists, also sang the so-called Anthem to the End of the World, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled".
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the end, if we succeed and the end of the world does not come...
It will be sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The hymns will suddenly be linked in a unique live broadcast on Czech television.
The lyrics to this song were written by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are actively involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and have fun.
What will the profits from the concerts towards the end of the world be used for?
On the equipment of the barrier-free educational center Studio, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the Tap civic association in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ková Institute.
Students of the schools of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly visited by lecturers and are engaged in activities that they enjoy and are interested in.
Students themselves do not have the means to become lecturers themselves, so we try to make it possible for them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and artists will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We have tried to create a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar “bombing events” in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, since we are already in the USA, would like to connect this with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on an electric trolley, their trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we drag a large amount of cargo and toolboxes with us...
However, so far it has always been done without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, which I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we recently returned, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how they differ in accessibility, public access to the disabled and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have witnessed in Russia that in the East everything is still in its infancy.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to move himself in the city center.
There is no such thing as a preference for wheelchairs in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civic associations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
In what ways do we still have to catch up with more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're still lagging behind...
However, it is important to note that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In both London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to a museum, anywhere...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life there, on the contrary, we are a little ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being barrier-free is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things really start to change.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is very popular nowadays, but let’s go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I started as a tutor at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play the saxophone, among other things, so together with a colleague I founded an interesting music ring.
Well, over time, as our presenter Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity has only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we began to connect with well-known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We realized that the work that is not visible is basically as if it did not exist.
In addition, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is crowded with things where one mimics the other.
It is logical in a way, everything new is taken with caution and it takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that is natural...
But that regret is completely useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full-fledged life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I'm saying that when something works for people with disabilities, it's not just for them, it's for the whole society.
Did being a strict boss, as many people have called you, also help this success?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, run out of preparations and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, then the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and want to achieve something.
The band The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Ladda Angelovi<0xC4><0x87>.
We are an open group, people come and go, it cannot be prevented.
Who has the will and the taste, always has the door open for us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21:00
It will be held in Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will connect via telebridge while singing The Tap Tap's song "The End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEE at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ková Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million.
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old have free tickets in the Bohemiaticket pre-sale
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on November 12, 2008).
Poland started working closely with ESA in 1994 and has been involved in a number of ESA projects over the years.
However, Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Polish spaceflight enthusiasts had been engaged in before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I will recall, for example, A. Sternfeld’s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on 6 December 1933 presented the ideas from his pioneering work The Entry into Cosmonautics.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelteri and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his Entry into Space in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonautics, and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway train was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the design is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is unclear whether the missile was to be used to start the train or to brake it.
Information about this dresin is known only from the contemporary press.
In 1933, Polish artillery began to use rockets.
The research was carried out by the Arms Technology Cell in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the preserved materials it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric fighter missile, designed by engineer Rohozinski, appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work Rocket - torpedo wyrzeda i rakietobomba lotnicza by Leliwy-Krzywoblockego was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) devoted all the projects of military use of missile technology, which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ended the start of the war.
After the war, other works devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problemy, which contains four more extensive articles on astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and already in the fall, PTA became a full member.
And in the following year, the first chairman of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Bled Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next development type was to be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to have an access of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
However, in 1962, further development was suspended.
The first RM rocket was the Meteor-1, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in space size for scientific instruments.
In the rocket Meteor-1A was available space with a volume of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and created the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Abolishing the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalized world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic entities, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the significant differences in the price of labor, (wages) there are price tensions.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the situation in which a producer tries to compete by importing cheap goods by "beating" the price of a competitor in order to attract more market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs to either transfer production abroad, or buy cheaply there, or disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and hence no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is aggravated by the complete reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social harm that he caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The reckless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies in which the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital a chance on its own population, regardless of social decline.
This is mainly reflected in the changes to the current laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the price dictate of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty, along with growing disparities between the poor and the rich.
For many years, there have been public food dispensaries in Germany for the poor, who cannot make a living by their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for people who are properly employed to receive such a salary that the state has to pay them up to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also made public in the case of auxiliary employees of the Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people, under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in the social level, are forced to either emigrate as they did in the 19th century, or to live on starving wages on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital may one day come to the country.
The question is, where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian, or an African still work for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic catastrophe.
The private capital firmly insists that the State must not intervene in the economy through managerial interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, now actually controls politics, and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is a clear answer yes.
The proof is the existence of an almost omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the field of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is criminal, but nothing is criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, for lack of funds, commission private law firms, which are often associated with industry, to draft laws.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power thus comes not from the people as proclaimed by Western-type constitutions, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is evident that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation, as Appianus describes it in his Crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete disintegration and the offices have been occupied by violence.
For bribes, illegal gaining of favor, and with the help of stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption prospered without any hindrance, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote" ..."characteristic people did not apply for office at all, so once as a result of this disruption was the state eight months without consuls." .."Indeed, it began to be said that the only remedy in a bad situation is self-government."
Conclusion As in antiquity, modern society is based on the reckless preference of self-interest, regardless of the overall social interest.
By its very nature, private capital is no longer able to understand and apply the general benefit of society.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of the elites without any deeper reform efforts.
The causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the demise of these systems in favour of a liberal-type democracy can be considered a break with the expectation of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites completely ignore in the future the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition both at the international and intra-European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state’s capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence and never can." Sting in Fragile's song, whose main refrain verse is "Let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no war" Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there has been, as always, a great deal of reaction.
Some support Israel, argue for its right to self-defence, and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodic waves of killings and who is the victim, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
My aim is to offer my readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who primarily serves the 95-year-old tension (calculated since Balfour’s declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by available historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who were completely autonomous in directing their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands one who might be considered the head of an octopus (if anyone else is standing above them I do not know, but I do not rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Sure. Sure.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought in the nineteen nineties to stop linking their name to the highly criminal acts they were behind, which for them always meant consolidating power, increasing wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where central bank shares are not being waged or preparing wars (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there are only four left, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore Rothschild's Bank of America status, began issuing his own (understand the government's) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 at the theater.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859-1871 to formulate a plan for three world wars by the mason of the highest, 33rd degree initiation by Albert Pike.
The first was to abolish the great monarchist states in Europe, the second was to abolish the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular, and the third was to reduce the world population to somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a foreground for such a solution) and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of wealthiest families headed by the Rothschilds works is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao – order out of chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, so as not to repeat the crises that they provoked in 1907).
So, after they succeeded in starting World War I in Sarajevo by assassinating the Habsburg successor to the throne of R-U Ferdinand, they destroyed tsarist Russia by initiating the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militaryly and economically unjustified, surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and the consequent fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the unleashing of the Second World War, the bankers of the politicians allowed to create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating the presumption of radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then it was enough for them to put the Germans in a position strong enough, guilt-declaring and simple solutions, with a German leader, and then with the creation of a multinational nationality.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds encouraged the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The outbreak of World War II, whether Hitler broke from the chain on which he was initially held by the international bankers, or all he had planned was difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as war reparations brought Germany into World War II, the declaration of the state of Israel created the focus of the third war.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the latter, will be victims in the first line of battle, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (just consider how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like in our case, international bankers push people to choose only their own candidates in the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu the hawk of all, is a typical example of the world's fascist, international bankers loyal, a politician who is doing everything to unleash a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), the world's hawk of all, is threatening to overgrow into a global conflict.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The New World Order in their imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn is implanted at birth with a chip that makes it a totally controlled being.
“And he compels all, small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, that they may not buy or sell, unless they are marked by the name of the beast or by the number of his name.
This is to be understood: let him who has understanding count the figures of the beast.
That number means man, and it is the number six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted Shah Mohammed Reza Páhlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive outlet - she could not afford to throw the shah overboard, because it would fundamentally jeopardize the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not possible.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detainees were finally released after 444 days, after the Algerian government brokered the negotiations.
Their fate at home has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled.
After difficult peripeties, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew who were inspecting the country's locations for shooting a sci-fi big movie.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's co-operation.
For the legend to be credible, a film project was written in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece of trickery - an example can be the series of Danny's partners.
In the film, moods alternate - on the one hand, documentary sequences from Tehran (the subtitle sequence shows iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lighter passages from Hollywood, negotiated with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck had a remarkable career restart.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director, and even his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime series Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not set in the director's hometown of Boston.
At the same time, the feeling for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that raised the director’s older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that occur when history suddenly moves somewhere.
Affleck and his associates achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the fake headquarters at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
He works with it quite successfully, sometimes he comes up with something to reality - everything does not work out so elegantly there (the scene in which the impending crisis at the Tehran airport turns away the phone call in America and the chase after the runway seems quite drawn to his hair).
The weakness of Argo, however, is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood co-workers, but their characters would deserve more space and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film is losing a bit of dramatic momentum, it is a film that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evoking the thrillers of the 1970s.
It's hard to pull.
As a reminder of a still living history in a certain way, and proof of how exaggerated are the ideas of omnipotent and omniscient secret services, but enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The website www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces a survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to launch a competition for the "most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led to this by the last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the poll.
Among the nominees for absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify the rates of insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have been favored in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include the mandatory incorporation of biofuels into fuels, which as a result is harmful to nature, the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism has also previously faced a de facto ban on the use of the term spread butter or the exclusion of incandescent bulbs from sale.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters.
The EU apparatus often makes decisions under the pressure of one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic is now pushing through the demands of its banks with the threat of a veto).
The interests of the lobby also supported the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to be at least 14 cm long in the Union and were not allowed to show "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by only harmonising existing inconsistent national standards that complicate trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have already been softened by the EU despite the resistance of some states, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for the victory in the survey can also be the last year's EU regulation, according to which it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has cited US research that suggests balloons among toys are the leading cause of death by suffocation in children.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing into pilgrimage rattles.
Curious ideas are born at home
Quite absurd, then, is the rule concerning the European officials themselves - everyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, and must speak instead of it about FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, Laissez Faire nominated for the survey, in addition to some of the above absurdities, for example, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum volumes of food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the prescribed volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting subsidies on request for a subsidy.
However, these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by not having a sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) said in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain was born in our country and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state was supposed to be full of warehouses, which it had to export.
For having the Czech Republic further to the ports, the EU was supposed to pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for obtaining subsidies were offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), specifically they were to go to the writing of the application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While the regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to make the functioning and development of the whole Union more efficient, according to a number of experts, are more worthy of recognition.
A more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the use of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which were forced by the Member States during budget negotiations.
The emotion among Czechs arouses the fact that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products, while not always succeeding in this fight.
After six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs defended the name of Olomouc tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky, but the domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed by our producers as tuzemák.
Only products made from cane distillate and not sugar beet can bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered EU products, the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the German Lübeck marzipan and the Parma ham have already found, for example, Karlovy Vary biscuits, Poho<0xC5><0x99>elick<0xC3><0xBD> and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> carp and <0xC5><0xBD>ateck<0xC3><0xBD> hops.
The EU trade mark can also be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and gorice tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked in our country without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country being robbed for the last twenty years, the thieves running around, the taxes increasing and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm in my forties and an independent nonpartisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you set off for the Castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who elected you?
All this time I said that I would fight for the Castle according to the result in the senate elections.
I later clarified that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool for me to realize my vision.
That is why I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
But the trouble is not only that as a nation we curse in the pub and at the TV, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
To this will be added the media, which demonizes man and confuses freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I bribed a journalist or that I was an advisor to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You went into the battle for the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the retroactive property confessions of over twenty million.
To do this, you have to change the law.
As president, however, you have no such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you plan to solve this?
When as a citizen I lobbied for guided tours to be a free trade, it was promoted.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or from the right, they deliberately reject it, and that delays the citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party boxing and dogmas, I can take something that is best for our country from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a leftist or a rightist?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
It doesn’t matter to me if it’s a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're damned if someone says you're a populist.
But you're not proving it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, all you have left is your passwords.
This is not enough for you in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that by going to people and talking to them, you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side to push it through.
If I were elected president, there would be no problem in organising a live television broadcast where I would ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want it.
If there is a strong personality who will name the failures, you can push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was the merit of public pressure.
To be honest, I'm an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started in politics, and I will try to win majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to move things on my own, and if I can't, I'm done in six years and I'm back in the private sector.
Sounds like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything about one person, so I've been going around a lot of famous people to see if they'd run for Senate as well.
I went to Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered fraud with light fuel oils.
I ran saying that people are really dissatisfied, but now I'm on the ballot.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who did did did most of the time elect the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people elected the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the clean past of every potential party member, and I don't have the money to do that either.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
Don't you have money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about $60 million.
In Prague I have a plot for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against bad things and bad things.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a $60 million fortune, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Am I supposed to get in debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors indicates that my program is probably not so interested.
And I'm not obligated to pay for the campaign on my own.
The cost of my campaign will basically cover what I'm going to get as a senator.
But I wouldn’t make a living from it, for example, I couldn’t pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to mute these activities?
But it has nothing to do with the salary.
As promised, I have partially suppressed my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the manager of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who would save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much are you used to taking per month as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I'll take further.
And if I were president, I'd quit my business.

The architects of the MVRDV are proof that real adventures do not take place only in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"The building looks cheerful, it looks futuristic, finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks by the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large enterprise, says: "Of course, the house is nice."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
Nobody volunteers to go to any of these old-fashioned libraries anymore, right?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in the immediate vicinity of Rotterdam with no job opportunities of its own, which is not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
With a population of 80,000, this municipality has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To resolve this stupid situation, the decision was made a few years ago to contribute to general education and build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not at all daunting.
And so the city councillors realized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely bold column graphs and maker of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calm and appeared at the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the commission was still looking around in amazement and shrugging its shoulders, the impudent Maas placed his gifts on himself according to the size and ended his activist-reasoned speech with the words, "Dear urban community!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was built for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is nominated for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
Small town grey, which so far could not offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind the white facade of which you would rather expect a dairy, is richer in a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: reader's eldorado under the cheese hatch.
Although the elevator runs through the mountain massif, you will discover the real spatial and reading passions only when you climb the topography on foot.
On all sides, the glazed interior is bright and clear, the floor of a burnt cabbage and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally, bookshelves stand along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space that is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the space for the readers from the inside out.
The inside of the Book Mountain is cleverly used: in the middle there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a home appliances center.
A special delight is the black bookshelves, which are one wall cladding, one window sill, and sometimes a stair railing.
The appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Even sworn architects and civil engineers shake their heads over the unknown building material.
“We wanted to work here with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, in a request to Standard magazine.
So one day, at a Frisian farm, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years, millimeter fleece made of synthetic material has been used as a substrate under the roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
Thin textiles last for one, two seasons, and then are ripe for disposal in bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - was pressed on boards four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
Take the 105 steps to the top.
At the end of the almost 500 m long walk, you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the right humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology," Trouborst says.
It is heated and cooled by the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines only briefly inside, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden ties, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shading and capture a large part of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest can handle fully automatic roller shutters.
Stefan Spermon, an early IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg the "long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
First, the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently has 70,000 copies, were to be filled.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
Thus, the MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated they are.
This is the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the decision to accept Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against a proposal for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
Berlin abstained from voting.
Why? Hmm?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it will support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Eventually, NATO took over.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, away from the policy that was, so to speak, guided by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just getting settled in their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
foreign policy, such as in France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows readiness to take positions in the case of national interests that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and Germany must therefore protect its own interests.
Did economic interests influence the stance in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, they must be careful not to deter the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
Either way, that plays a role.
But I don’t want to give too much importance to it, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
This, however, plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany’s relations with the US suffer when Germany abstained from voting on both important decisions, such as the Palestine vote?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding for the German attitude.
That is why I do not think that this was such a dramatic turning point as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from this.
This signals that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, is clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. domestic policy.
I think that the Obama administration has, perhaps in secret, a considerable understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, of course, he cannot take this position publicly.
I don’t think the differences of opinion are as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
This is what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader line and must instead push things forward from their own position.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does it even want to take the lead?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a bigger role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, there are anti-German sentiments whenever Germany takes on a bigger role.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum.
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more popular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is an Armani Polo?
Behind this is a name that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection as long as it is not sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether the law will be enforced.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office, which specializes in protecting rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters only need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, they will have Prada-Kny registered.
In this way, German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens the bin with the records of the stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that parasitizes the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are known to be world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores, in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
But Pattloch’s cases are different: under the mandate of his mandates, he is working against Chinese firms obtaining from the trademark office a fully official right to use the mark, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an affiliate brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's hurting business, we have to fight it," Pattloch urges.
"The brand dilutes, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to market research company CLSA, China is the third largest luxury goods market and the fastest growing market with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year.
However, deleting dubious entries in the register of brands is difficult to achieve and costs something.
The procedure may take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the reproached name became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
When the plaintiff is unlucky, he has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is a law of the jungle.
Known cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
For this reason, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few staff and space.
But last year, it was reported that "the course of the work process has returned from an emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of pending opposition proceedings fell by 22%.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75% more than the previous year.
There are still 81,500 complaints pending.
Doing something about it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive figures.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million requests for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China leads the list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million of them.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were levied on fees.
This means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
To start a dispute against it costs several times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
The company has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans, however, achieved the abolition of its illegal production of imitation car parts.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would have neglected this ourselves, because in Germany surnames cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The stamp office of the CTMO also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In the other two instances Freudenberg won the right, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will lead to a good ending and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the company, they even had to look at 100-year-old files in order to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg was in vain offering a "high six-digit amount in euros" to the opposing party in order to settle the dispute.
"You can see what that means to us," Wentzler says.
The danger from the Far East threatens to hit Europe as well.
And that's if the imitators get unprotected stamps there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to apply for the Freudenberg label for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long since been abandoned by the group, but it has managed to deflect registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights; rather, foreigners should "report everything worth protecting in any way in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the final act of its drama, it may have to pay royalties for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Trampling, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, orphans of parents who died of AIDS are happy about it.
The story of a connection that travels much more than 8,733 kilometers.
First there is the trampling: cowboy high boots, basketball boots, women's boats and men's moccasins look for the bar on the floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - insist, mum and chase each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it from his textile boots as he joins voices with his softly wild gestures.
It's Monday night, and the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty female singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a researcher of human genetics to a janitor, came to the study.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different lyrics and, moreover, in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans of parents who died of AIDS.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 orphans of their parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, the Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
Seventy of them attend a secondary school.
For <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 a month you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" in Zulu, or "the one who exalts."
No one can speak fluent Bantu in this space except singing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign soft language, and sometimes brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, the village of Esiteni is dependent on the strength of the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay or straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to HIV.
In Esiteni, there is little to see in Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry a virus of weakened immunity in them. It is not uncommon that they die in less than 30 years.
The village was discovered by a congregation on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but above all, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but virtually everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, they have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was still a private deployment of individuals, which made it possible for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
A year later, however, the Voices for Africa choir was founded, which has since taken care of orphans of parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
Scabies and scabies are parasitic SPIs.
Who are among the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently are chlamydia infections, trichomonases, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV fall into this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more often than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are often found among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and will therefore go unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
For the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent switching of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPIs and prevent later consequences.
Patronage, charitable donations, and, last but not least, the fees that the choir earns by singing throughout Germany will raise some money.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjena," said Annette Lennartz, chairwoman of the association.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can assert herself.
He also cares for orphans to find shelter, for example, with some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the Zulu language calls old women, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and ensured that the children would arrive at school on time every day in uniforms.
The children, who no longer have anyone, go to the shelter to Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa established a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to get tested for HIV.
It's not a matter of course, even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Quite strange, actually, in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immoderate lifestyle.
Politics instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is also to blame for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
The culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together every two or three years through southern Africa, singing songs full of grief, combativeness, confidence in the future and black confidence that many in the southern tip of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award not only brings mood and joy, but also has already shed tears from many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitenya, where the singers visit the children they are supposed to patronize.
Although this village can hardly be found on maps, it is more than familiar in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitenya, there is light," they say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8,733 kilometers from here, to the stepping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you see that the light is shining here too.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday by the science magazine.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the area of this planet, which lies in permanent shade.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters in length and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or even asteroids that hit Mercury.
“Let’s not put the finding of ice in the context of the existence of life on this planet,” said Sean Solomon, the lead scientist working on the Messenger spacecraft.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help explain how water and other basic elements of life got to other regions of the solar system.
Sondes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved Earthlings, participate in the exploration of the depths of space.
From time to time, pictures are sent to Earth, small windows to endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Just like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 new definition.
This snippet from the Spitzer infrared image shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, harder to identify are pink-colored "newborns" in the birth chamber of stars.
This star-forming region — scientists call it unromantic W5 — was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changing heat of a dying star was captured by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The Vdolkova ring consists of the material that the star ejected during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, which is 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are formed from the gas and dust.
The image of the galactic “cradle” was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the "Seven Sisters", is visible to the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, colors stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to the observer in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to the terrestrial continent gave this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of unusual coloration.
This "baby" among the stars was able to capture in full beauty up to the infrared detectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they formed is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: a vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies become real works of art according to their coloration.
The image, released by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triangular), because the dark stripes of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar nursery into three parts.
In the constellation of the Serpent, astronomers have photographed the foreboding of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are pushing each other and must inevitably collide.
This star birth was observed by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical shortcuts can call it South Windmill.
A photograph taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows a snapshot of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
This 1,400 light-years away nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It depicts a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was captured by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way galaxy.
The cradle of stars gives rise to new increments.
Also, these stellar clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are producing ever-new young stars, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
There is still no dust in this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed only shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly present throughout the universe.
Our views of space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey and used by Galileo Galilei a year later to observe stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger – and the views they convey are getting deeper and deeper.
The largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of an inexpensive method of construction: the telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, equals the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists in space search for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who will make available its computing power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There's the Very Large Telescope -- and it honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate even the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is to have a full 42 meters and is to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the pictures can be counted on at the earliest in 2018.
The two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also uses the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea is to be created a new giant telescope - with a thirty-meter diameter of the mirror.
You can admire it here in the picture.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
He has been providing images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially habitable ones, since March 2009.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been identified since the mission began.
This image documents the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard the Ariane5 rocket in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to reach the biblical age.
There is also a museum of longevity.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to reach the biblical age.

Searching for tracks in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Ride through the Talysh Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The minibus roars along a road with many turns along densely forested hills, predatory rivers and simple peasant buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in the Black Forest.
However, this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talish, about which not much is known, except that they speak both Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and live to a very old age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This small town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arriving from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
At 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-lane.
The fairytale wealth that the countries owe to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has enough to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Talysh from the surroundings, who are over a hundred years old. Fatulayev shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still gave birth to a child.
The controversial star of the museum, however, is the sheep shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>ari Müslümov, who was allegedly 168 years old.
The birth certificate does not exist.
And given that the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, Müslüm's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he reportedly still had a daughter.
So did <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, at his age, make a mistake by a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
“Notably, many elderly people also live in some areas of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men.”
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when there are no matrices.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerik live to reach the Biblical age remarkably often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why are there so many old people in the South?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the Fatulev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it consists in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, does not seem exactly credible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayev lives in Cengemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butterhouse, which he waves tirelessly.
Eight people live under the same roof, including one of Mirza's sons and a daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
There are also two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical belly glasses of "armada".
Mirzaeva’s white teeth form the perfect line and she hides long dark blonde copes under the scarf, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn’t look like it and kept its color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzaeva says.
A monthly pension is enough
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was during the Second World War.
But everything improved when the paddle was taken over by "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that is made around the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros), which is a well-deserved amount for the local population.
And perhaps Mirzaeva’s long-bearded son is right: “Old people are very respected in our culture.”
They live in the midst of a large family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
Unless it's a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term “human rights” is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution is back in Cairo.
The protests in Cairo have revealed the country’s deep divisions.
A future constitution based on Sharia law is being sharply debated.
The Egyptian president did not spare pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And I am responsible for this, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but above all to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secular people.
All of them, still hopelessly at odds in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "State of God" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi almost apologised that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the constitutional court and expanded his own to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, neither the Egyptians nor the world is clear about.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
The 234 paragraphs, which the 100-member, Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly hastened to approve in a 15-hour night marathon, are in part a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, this proposal also says that jurisdiction is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and one can fear that Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, this is highlighted by the newly added paragraph: In all matters pertaining to Sharia, one should consult with al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence over the whole of Sunni Islam.
This may not be the case, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over the legislation, which would result in the judiciary being effectively disenfranchised.
There are many interpretations in the Constitution.
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
According to the proposal, the state should also protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values”.
This is formulated legally so inaccurately that state institutions could even use this paragraph to control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph in writing defines explicit equality between men and women.
But another paragraph forbids blaspheming or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
It is unclear, however, what vilification is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally dubious is the formulation that it is forbidden to “insult people”.
In this case, is a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of law experts enough?
The matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and, according to his words, will be presented to the Egyptians "very soon" for the purpose of a popular vote.
"The revolution is back"
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the Islamist overwhelmingness.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the constitutional charter before it comes into effect.
"The revolution has come back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradei, said the draft constitution belonged "to the dustbin of history".
Twitter has accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali as saying.
Several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared an uprising, not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayers on the other side of the Nile in front of the University of Cairo.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters who cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They cried out to Morsi, “Clean up the land,” and they said, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably trigger a civil war-like situation.
Mursi's supporters clearly didn't want to take the risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which way the country should go.
A majority in favor of the Islamist proposal is considered certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur once."
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is handed to Hafez Abu Sa'da.
A forty-eight-year-old human rights defender and chairman of Egypt’s Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the new constitution does not include the words 'human rights' even once," he complained in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's extension of power to all three powers in the state forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president has effectively abolished it," Sa'da complains.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which watches the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could have his revenge.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster you can no longer control."
Norwegian rakfisk: The most smelly fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret to a country’s success be linked to a local appetite for extraordinarily stinky fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it lie for a week.
This way you get the smell of paralyzing rakfiska, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, there's a beautiful view - and there's a ubiquitous smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout fermented in water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to gather for a festival dedicated to this, how to put it best, most captivating dish.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter but also the so-called "Rakfisk general" who is responsible for the festival's course.
All around us, people eat small cubes of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," says Havard.
Drinking can kill the odor.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, the fish were dipped in airtight barrels with water and salt in the fall.
Then, in the midst of winter, when they were well fermented, they went out and ate - no doubt the senses were dulled by alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
Residents of Sweden, an old rival who until recently was much richer than Norway, are flowing into the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, an indispensable, albeit rather smelly, part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Even if everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you <0xC2><0xA3>9 ($14) a piece.
Norway is often lacking in global news - and it seems to suit the majority of the population.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still cited with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called the “July 22 event.”
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway’s current wealth lies the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says our waitress Anna, with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes, as she serves the plates with the crumbs.
We are, as you say, reasonable people.
Her English, like the English of most people here, is absolutely flawless.
We don't show off, we don't like pomp.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown wasted money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had the cords tightened tight on their purse.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for something to eat - I've had enough of rakfiska.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But tonight the smelly fish is here again.
The hotel where I live is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most demanding, fish.
They're connected to a live TV show in which a bow tie moderator is surrounded by a plate of raffikes.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Howard."
There is applause and laughter.
A man falls out of a chair, possibly aquavitic.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Peña Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC’s Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In the city, which is jammed even in the best of times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sherpa and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico was doing well economically during the reign of outgoing Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence,” President Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the US president, President Peña Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
Straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered in a good way.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways built by Pena Nieto. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that used to be here.
Plates bearing his name also hang on the walls of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum with a theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," said Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a friend and political ally of President Pena Nieto's Party of Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country so urgently needs.
After uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was ousted by Vicent Fox.
Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected from Enrico Pena Nieto within the party.
And he rejects the opposition's statement characterizing the new president as a person with no substantive content.
He is a very straightforward man, very biased with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and above all, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Tucked under the motorway overpasses, it resembles in many ways the suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
And the problems in the self-governing municipality are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help tackle drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a huge landfill.
When Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pena Nieto say he failed to adequately address the issue of women’s murders during his tenure in office.
And in the worst case, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house typical of a decaying neighborhood, Irine Buendia shows me photos of his deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses her crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body had been washed," Buendia recalls.
There were punch marks on him, and post-mortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which there is one word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what was denied to them.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, troublemaker and whiner.
They just want you to accept what they say and keep quiet.
“But it can’t be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions,” he says.
The sherpa that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been hit by violent crime in Mexico in the past six years, and the new president has vowed to make it a priority for him for as long as he remains in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," said PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to disprove Bradley Manning's allegations of ill-treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds of Manning's ill-treatment in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of leaking the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Attorney General Ashden Fein, in a cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during the nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during a hearing conducted on the motion of the defence to dismiss the case against Manning on the grounds of ill-treatment at the time of detention, which is in itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide while in detention.
An army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday’s hearing, military prosecutor Fein and Manning went through forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at Quantico Prison, where he was held in high security from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and rated the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although Manning’s officers directly asked how he was being treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally about the various problems, and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would be addressed, but had not noted them.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing concerns) and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 when he met with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts that he had expressed on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during the meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regime.
The military said it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under the regime for suicide) to protect him and the safety of others.
“I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regimen... so I could enjoy the increased quality of life I saw,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transportation to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention facility at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was contemplating suicide in Kuwait, and once fainted because of heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the world around him was very depressing.
"My world has only shrunk to Arifjan base, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving at Quantico, he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell with no company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against regulations.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn’t see his face when he turned the other way at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned the allegations he made in Thursday’s testimony that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other fellow inmates at the morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket while counting.
During Friday's interrogation by Judge Manning, he said that on the orders of his guards, he thought he had a blanket to hide, but admitted that no one had given him an order to put it away.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his slippers to hurt himself, but he didn’t.
Manning testified that his underwear, shoes and glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in the course of his imprisonment and that if he is convicted before a military court, which is expected to begin early next year, he will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it plans for Manning to plead guilty to lower crimes and fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to begin this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning was being held in accordance with regulations regarding all detainees held in maximum security custody.
The charges brought against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally causing intelligence documents to be published on the Internet, the transmission of national security-related information, and the theft of public property or records.
If he is charged on all counts, he may be sentenced to life in prison.
My Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient opportunities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made my way through the crowd and arrived at the Immigrant Agenda area, where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn’t know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and all my life I've been called a "Mexican."
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
So later I ended up with the label "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.
However, I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I can not get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for the "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment this week when newly-elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
On the agenda were the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
He wants to unite with the United States and Canada to form a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Peña Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, although he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, under the threat of arms, to transfer half of the Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the span of centuries, not minutes, the remarks are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the representative of the United States says something just a little bit critical about Mexico, you will hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite about how Americans are interfering with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will set out on the path of war.
Yet the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom it does not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we’re living the American dream now, going to good schools, and having a good job, we can never forget the fact that we’re living the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and they see us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, in their opinion, is only a failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they'd never have left him.
And we would not find ourselves now trapped behind the silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are and Mexican Americans hate it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don’t feel like they’re part of any of them.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you have no roots in either.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “provisional ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American compatriots how great it is to visit this country and push political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And due to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel resentful of the way their family members have been treated in a much more recent past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such action is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary speculations about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed. And for the first time rockets landed from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, like it or not, are caught in the chaos of the region.
Perhaps this will make their fight even bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this may break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason to be optimistic.
Even if the November 21 ceasefire held, the fighting this week has strengthened hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the locking up of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most desolate and populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently run by its steadfast rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power that was once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas, as did Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The cheerful people of Hamas say that the Islamic Crescent encircles Israel, north of Lebanon, ruled by the Hezbollah party/milice, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly inclined towards Islamism can overthrow Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
Above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has altered the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be excluded by either Israel or America.
On the other hand, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system proved its worth, and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as steadfast as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively calm from suicide bombers, partly due to the wall that hits the West Bank, a major part of what might one day be a Palestinian state, and protecting Jewish settlements that are still growing despite their illegality from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party allied itself with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil these treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they be firing rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better if we keep them behind that wall and punch them when they push their heads out.
Hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, do not like Israel very much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments heal their economy.
The fact that President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may mark the beginning of something new.
Israelis should also look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, the denial of Palestinians’ right to self-determination is creating a gunpowder barrel that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel – just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already today, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are aggravating the situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody raids against Gaza every few years to repress Hamas will increasingly levy a diplomatic tribute.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and this newspaper are saying: two states, when Israel cedes territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that a ceasefire will give outside pressure at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which along with Turkey and Qatar must push for a halt to arms supplies to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 border with an exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from the outside must also push for agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than just offer virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has a role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term in office, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant in his entry into the process.
That's pathetically short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Ugly Cigarette Packaging Laws in Australia
On the unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australia’s Ugly Tobacco and Cigarette Packaging Act, the first of its kind in the world, came into force and replaced the logos and colors of the brands with generic olive-green boxes with hideous pictures of sick parts of the body and depictions of children and newborns suffering from the effects of their parents’ smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the boxes are the names of the brands that are printed in the same small font.
It is the world’s strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to deter young people from smoking by depriving it of its appeal.
It relies on studies that show that if people don’t start smoking before the age of 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never start.
“Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them with their product,” said Federal Health Secretary Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on multinationals’ profits, other countries are considering introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry strongly lobbied against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that the law will increase black market trade, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“This legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will import much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette packaging made of silicone used to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals regarding the lawsuit.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible nuisance, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographics of the group targeted by the plan.
After a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from direct view, tobacco marketing has shifted online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
“If you’re a tobacco marketer and you’re left with just that little space to promote your products, the online space is an unsurpassed place to be,” says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in the ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the "average Honzo".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job of making this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how it handles new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations – countries within the World Trade Organization claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries have significant trade with Australia.
The decision of the CJSC is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments considering similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
It has now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are being considered by the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
“You just take out a cigarette and put the box back in,” says Victor El Hage while buying a box with a picture of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says the unified boxes make it harder for him to even out the shelves.
"It took me an hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them altogether, then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, we'll close the store,'" he said, throwing his hands away.
In a world of constant connection, it’s not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite being distracted by books, magazines, and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming up with the praise of boredom.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly attached to some screen these days, we have no chance to enjoy boredom.
Should we support boredom?
Yes, I am.
Oh, no.
But I'll get back to that.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more leisure time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, says, he is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The difficulty is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to."
Boredom differs from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says that in apathy there is no compulsion to do something.
He says that the core of boredom is "disturbing the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and a sense of slow-moving time."
Boredom can resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read an article from the journal.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why, and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “like finding the wrong parts on a factory line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and scribbling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom fight and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to spin learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," Fenske said.
We've all experienced boredom at times - the delay of my flight, the buzzing speaker, especially the lengthy film.
Some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the Boredom Proveness Scale in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions like, “Many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do them all.”
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers are generally inactive.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knew that “teening up is the peak time for boredom,” which is largely due to the fact that children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take ridiculous physical risks, gamble, or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have debated the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn’t always know the best thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will no longer be bored, but he will not learn how to entertain himself or drive independently, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate management is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to have fun on their own, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of constant grinding activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of wanting to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he said, “it’s hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise turns off.”
There is no manual in Colorado on the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old college student and soccer player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state -- possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was driving with a few friends in Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was given a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use -- minor offences for which each fine is $100 -- and was given a trial date.
'They treated us like criminals, 'said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends more on the spot than on the law.
Hundreds of marijuana possession offences have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older of holding small amounts that will be legally allowed after the law comes into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado counties have said they will continue with existing marijuana-related cases, and still accuse people of possession.
At the same time, several cities in the Denver suburbs are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their communities.
“This is happening so fast that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington have also been rattling their heads.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for growing, producing, distributing and selling - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith has admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent that we can follow," he said.
Washington’s I-502 law comes into effect on December 6th, also leaving an annual vacuum during which there will be no state licensing system yet, but legal possession does.
And there are fierce mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, such as how to balance the state’s directive on “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana with its ban on the cannabis trade within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis store than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates of the city of Aurora sent an email to his officers announcing that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offenses for possession of small amounts of marijuana from every citizen over the age of 21, and that police would “immediately” stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said police will enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and will continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offenses that were criminal offences at the time they occurred," Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was complicated in places such as the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer accuse adults of holding small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the country have revealed deep divisions between local officials in view of this large-scale state green experiment.
For district attorneys, it’s a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing marijuana possession defendants, and a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can’t really accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on their way to becoming national test cases for drug legalization.
Attorneys and state authorities are planning new frontiers for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will yield.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana vendors and patients who use it that have attracted attention, the federal government has largely left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are unlikely to slam the door to catch a small bag of drugs, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana trades permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado towns are not awaiting federal action.
Before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana deals, although it will take about a year before any store can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose proposed a six-month ban and is likely to come into effect next week.
“We don’t want to get into a situation where we give someone a license and then we have a big federal issue,” Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council, said in a statement.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the community voted for, as opposed to what the state voted for.
There really are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a Conservative."
Today’s university students are not the only ones being attacked for their views.
I don't remember ever dreaming of going to Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world’s largest seat of knowledge, a modern wrapped Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And yet, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of going to Worcester College to study history, I packed my bags and rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I objected to the students making love in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson profanely declared that I had left because I had been forced to drink from broken cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I was subjected to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a Conservative.
You may be wondering why I'm pulling it out now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of the center suffer similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR at Corpus Christi College say that because of their political views, they are “often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and made clear that they are not welcome.”
They call for a position on the University’s Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they are free to communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently aired BBC Two documentary program Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student political events, which portrayed the conservatives as weirdoes and neo-Nazis.
The show featured a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and wore a stick with a silver head.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "sacrificial lambs" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that “left-wing influence is growing in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who stands behind the movement for more protection, says such a climate is “unpleasant,” while 19-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cheril says there has been a deterioration in the JCR’s approach to people on the right from the center.
“This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a one-member minority.
I started in September 1986, aged 18, and paralyzingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the most bitter.
A year earlier, the university had voted against granting an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
Even the Stalinists would be apprehensive of the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when the new students interacted with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the wormwood that was to come.
I found that not only do professors tacitly approve of taunting conservative pupils, but they also participate in it with pleasure.
A policy of mining strike, privatization and government opposition to anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa was introduced into the wood-lined auditoriums.
My first lecture was about translating a French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, the little man with the face like cake dough, was very bile.
"The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy with social matters," Professor Pitt growled.
I went back to my room.
At dinner at school, I was sitting alone when I felt a slight tapping on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, that's the case.
Anyone suspected of being a conservative is a target.
It's bad enough for me already, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted I didn't agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics, and economics, who (ironically) went to Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students were with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're beating each other up, aren't they?
I felt the same way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to change into a Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years have evolved before me as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher’s foreign policy advisor and one of those who write her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated the place for its provinciality and pettiness, and for its inclination towards a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents' home in London, seeking refuge with my unpretentious metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a dream city.
Even my communist friends always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes grimaced.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week, in the course of my studies, when another professor of history in complete seriousness declared that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Even though I blushed with shame inside, I confessed that my parents had brainwashed me and called them “old fools.”
The relief was short-lived.
My father put a nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he was writing two columns a week for Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I crawled inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snuffy weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and poisoning in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, was Oxford, which not only gave rise to 14 Conservative prime ministers, but also to this day hides behind an undeserved reputation for a place of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which opened this week in London, ABC spoke to Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which presents more than 130 top-of-the-line models created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, which, however, without his respected clients could not have been written.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, is full of private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan through the Greek Princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to an idol of the international "bohemian cream".
To love the royal family is not a bad thing.
"At least they don't stick a cigarette stick in a great carpet, like some great pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased to be invited to his cabin in Gstaad," explains ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he's a star."
Valeria Mazz presents Valentina
The designer’s charisma is not forgotten by the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
"It's been many years since we went to his house for dinner after a parade at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he was reflected and his spirit was felt.
He made everyone who was invited feel important and loved,” recalls the top model, who started working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
The Nobility Show
Gravani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of genuinely reciprocated loves.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was rebuilt into a distinctive seventy-meter-long leather passage that offers a role swap: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the passage to observe the "population" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces wear like the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose, or the costumes that Jackie Kennedy wore for her wedding with Aristotle, or the costumes she worew.
In the audience of models, names such as Sibylle of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "you can not forget about it".
"I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, shirts, vest "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him over others because of his femininity and his great love for women, because he underlines our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria said in a statement.
“I really like the colors he uses, they brighten up a lot and give a ‘spark’ to his face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she longed to be an adult and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally arrived in the late 1990s.
"I bought my first Valentine's dress to celebrate at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with ruffles, a ruffled girdle, and a strapless top.
It was a dream that became a reality,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is lax with fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in them".
The "King" of Fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul the Greek in 1995.
To create this silk dress of ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different laces and a four-and-a-half-meter-long lift, it took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstress).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the biggest authority in the specialized press, this dress represents a milestone of the top fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of high society clients."
Dazzled by the elitist "savoir-être" over the years, Valentino is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honour in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated with the Legion of Honour accumulates as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his elegance, calmness, well-groomed and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was perfect, and time left no trace of him.
When the princess says...
The hardest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano area
For four euros, carriers in the Indonesian volcano area gamble with their lives and health as they carry 70 kilograms of sulfur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Ant Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living mining sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, it has to fly every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and when in contact with air it passes into a solid state.
After cutting large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilograms, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the top of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes over 40 minutes for exhausted carriers to climb up at a tortoise pace, as they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so as not to slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as happened to a French hiker who fell from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn five cents for every pound of sulfur they mine
When they are upstairs, they make their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and wearily carry heavy baskets to a weight that the mining company has placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters above sea level.
PT Candi Ngrimbi has been mining the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar bleaching.
“Because 70 kilos are normally worn, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and at the end it is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although it seems like a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it is three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage of miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros), "explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a mason.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2) per day and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Yav<0xC4><0x81>r, I took her to Yav<0xC4><0x81>.
Anto has asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him, despite his face being protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's asthmatic, he's breathless, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
This is the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than worthy English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man chased by fate could be a tour guide, a waiter or a receptionist at a hotel, and instead do the work of a porter.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulfur does not cease to boil at night, and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto flashes into the crater and illuminates his path with a small flashlight, which he has attached to his helmet and bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers carry sulfur baskets from the bottom of the crater on their shoulders
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs, nor has it provided any equipment to self-employed carriers with such effort.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of 30,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5) from the photography surcharge, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2), is collected by nature park guards from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for cattle, not people,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old heavyweight who has been working in Kawah for only three decades since he left school.
He manages to lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that he will last as long as he can because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in dense fumes that emanate from the volcano, the miners are so assertive that none of them complain that they are suffering from serious diseases... but this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, and knee pain.
A Unainik who balances his basket on his back can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which is then transported by three trucks along a steep road between the thickets to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons, the eldest, 30, also makes a living mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world persists from generation to generation - the crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans are seduced by the fact that they have no children, for career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs growth."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but still – or maybe that’s why – the video spread massively to YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local allusions like “put a bun in the oven” as a mockery of Singapore’s birth rate.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that with this advertisement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The agency’s artistic director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the influence of music to help people fulfill their “civic duty.”
"It's all about the internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
This is the country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things like spread perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like a rap composition, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it lightly is the government of Singapore.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government’s marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
However, all of these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative officials and strict social controls.
Singapore has a birth rate of 1.2 children per woman in terms of population distribution.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Department at the National Population Office, said it was because of “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“People have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, it’s not just marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to the postponement of marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there have been efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against population decline, this has sparked resentment among the local population.
Some Singaporean websites show undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who have been criticized for keeping wages low and for making little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s government party recorded its worst election result since independence last year.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has known impacts on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policies, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate business.
The Office of Urban Development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of development firm EL Developers, claims that their “shoe boxes” sell far faster than larger homes.
“They’re more popular by selling days to weeks faster than larger homes.
That’s why they’re much better for our cash flow.”
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the nation’s birth rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district in downtown Singapore suggests they won’t have much effect.
“People are still stressed out, homes are expensive, as is education, which is why a lot of people put it off,” the young official said.
"Let the others have children.
But for me, it’s important to rely on your own money and time,” says another, about 20-year-old, young man.
Both men and women cite careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force people to have children, it's the Singaporeans who have the final say in starting a family.
What is private offline is private and online
-Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something of a personal nature or an “area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any interference”.
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone during normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely of their own" on a personal level and a "username and password" if it was a social network.
“I wouldn’t reveal my biggest secrets,” Jorge, 10, said in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I'm posting nice photos or photos of us playing on FB.
I also talk to friends there.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or a photo that made someone laugh,” she said.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, photos of naked persons or photos of crimes, or to write degrading or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I set up a Twitter account to express my views and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends,” she says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone he didn't know.
The case of fourteen-year-old Jose is different.
He owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and admits he doesn’t know 20 people on his friends list.
"I'm not afraid of that because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them were inducing him to do anything, or asking him for an address or a phone number.
"If they urged me or asked me to do so, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
These guys are no strangers to what is now called cyberbullying.
"A friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who he was," he said.
According to Jose, the victim didn't log out of the account.
"You just activated the private mode."
Then it explains a series of steps on how to set up an account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of famous people in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if someone bothered me or if I just wanted to.
“I know it’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to navigate social networks correctly, they must understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform.
“The Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed.”
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the paper Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are just learning ourselves," he says.
It is a complex subject, he explains, “because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet ripe for it.”
Also, to be – as far as the environment is concerned – prudent, at a time when what they want most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences.”
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do something doesn’t work,” he added.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post a picture of you the way you posted a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you mark people in the photos of the celebrations, did you ask them for permission?
And one more thing: Does everyone always need to know what you’re doing right now?
The next point is to make them realize that they must behave in the Internet environment as well as outside it.
It's the same rules.
“Outside the internet, one is guided by respect, morals and other principles, and the same should be true on social media,” he said.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-year teacher and educational advisor explains that it is necessary for parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand every trick, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences of opening an online account.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
The Guardian believes that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of “don’t talk to strangers”.
South America summit ends and Lima statement not published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Peru, ended today without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of Unasur heads of state and government, but representatives of the foreign ministry and the presidential office, who initially stipulated that the document would be published after the summit, said it would later be published on the Peruvian government's website.
They also said that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several brief press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly was broadcast without sound in the press room with the message "confidential session, audio transmission prohibited".
The small amount of information available to the journalists was provided by the spokespersons of some governments who were present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the talks was a list of the presidents involved, prompting hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets to ask for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent out an email to the media with a “concluding statement” from the summit, but this is only a statement by President Humala, and not an official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países <0xC3><0x81>rabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion, the originally promised Declaration of Lima was not published, even though it was ardently demanded by the press.
On the official website of ASPA it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely cut off the flow of information.
The summit concluded with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday, after hearing a defense speech from both sides, to discuss the dispute initiated by Lima against Santiago.
"We will comply with and enforce the verdict that will resolve the dispute that we are hearing today in this international court," President Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts,” he said, greeting President Humala with a handshake at the flags of the two countries.
The two presidents’ confirmation that they would submit to the ICC ruling was made public after Colombia accepted the Bogota Pact this week, expressing their submission to the judgments of the International Court of Justice that ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua, a decision Colombia deemed completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the impeachment of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and ending the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he informed that 16 agreements had been adopted and activities were planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $ 17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR member states will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which the residence agreements are being extended".
He said actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, “economic consolidation [of Latin America] should not be victorious in nature, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our peoples a better future,” Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections of various places in South America, especially rural and border areas ... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in a speech read out.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to better communication with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring it back to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is holistic and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said ahead of his attendance at the regional meeting that he hopes to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to discuss respectfully the judgment of the International Court of Justice on the maritime border dispute, which is being challenged by Bogota.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, no one is excluded, not even a deal with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with that country," he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and thoughtful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieta.
As part of the summit, EU defence ministers met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
UNASUR includes Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case indeed, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, the project defended the creation of South American citizenship, which is supported by the Unasur member countries.
"There is a need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country, which is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still backward areas that want to take us back to the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian president said he agreed to the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and that those who signed the San Jose Pact on human rights be taken into account.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is being funded by the United States,” he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa reiterated that he did not regret the decision because it did not betray his principles and respected his “deep democratic values and human rights”.
He added that “there were reasonable suspicions at the time that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process.”
In addition, he criticised the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be questioned on Swedish territory for alleged sexual misconduct, with “its own Swedish legislation allowing the interrogation to take place by videoconference, which could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental condition is at risk of deteriorating because he is confined in a small area without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
It would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
President Correa noted that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks had been held with London to resolve the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
“We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, as Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
He said, “If the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over.”
And if Sweden hears Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows without any problems and as has already been done in other cases, tomorrow the problem will be put to an end.”
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and made it clear that he definitely does not tolerate “above-average, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of a free press are not we, the vile and perverse politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his satisfaction that neither such journalists, “neither bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie, control Ecuador,” and that if he was re-elected, “he would continue to make changes on the right path and in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto on Unasur membership until at least its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and putschism veiled in legality" because in fact it "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also said he considered it "very appropriate" for his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, following a ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague that ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not currently accepted.
"This is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly in order to overcome them and be able to move forward.”
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court, and expressed the opinion that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries commit to accept the verdict, however harsh it may be".
Regarding the possibility of running in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term, he noted that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will withdraw from public life.
“I have never been personally interested in power, but such unjust situations as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility,” he said.
“If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, it's the same thing.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
“I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says that President Chávez has gone to scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign.
“This is not a relapse in the president’s health,” he said.
The head of state of Ecuador today attended the sixth summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a lightning bolt had struck me," he recounts, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor had tried to "moderate a little," but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own shoulders and began to inform himself about it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which he came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options, and greater stigma.
At the time, the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, “because he had a cut.”
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has destroyed the body and weakened the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "means great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara.
HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and a full life depends on the degree of impairment of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, while those who do not use drugs are better off: people with CD4 cells can live for up to 200 years.
Simply put, this means that a person who is diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can live without problems up to 75 years, according to these findings, while adhering to treatment, the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS Yearbook), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 so far this May. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
Why do people continue to die from the disease?
"It seems to me that the problem is not in the options of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted our supply of medicines, but the problem is that patients arrive at a very advanced stage because they do not know the state of the disease, that is, at a late stage of the disease."
He adds a compelling figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection is already manifested. All that needs to be done in order to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, so it is necessary to offer large-scale tests to detect the disease to all people who ask for it."
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco, as well as directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to have tests done in a private laboratory just because his friend did it, and despite his small age, he already had an AIDS outbreak and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the diseases.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather get three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthy, I exercise, I take medication.”
To this day, all his parents know is that he suffered from cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today as part of World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tested. If they risked it, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV-positive, it's better. And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarizes the theme of this year’s battle against AIDS.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara-based journalist who seeks information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has really increased, once they gave us one or two, now they give us packs and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Adolescents are among the most susceptible to new infections.
“What do you want it for?” is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers, and medical staff that teens want to avoid, the reporter says.
He suggested changing this ineffective distribution, so that condoms were not just behind the counters, but in the hundreds of dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“It’s not about promiscuity.
It’s not even about “paying for beer and a motel,” as Governor Emilio González said when asked if he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
It’s best to make condoms available to those who already have sex,” he said.
Key figures in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
In Mexico, the condition ranks fourth in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV-related cases.
92% of infections occur sexually, 6% by blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people who are unaware of the disease per registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognize the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt as stipulated by the bankruptcy in Mexico, sets an unfortunate precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighboring country and solvency issues.
Thus, it seems that the corporate restructuring procedures that are allowed by Mexican law do not apply in the country of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of Judge Harlin Hale’s ruling on June 15 last year in the Northern Texas Insolvency Court leaves Mexican firms unprotected in practice against the possibility of confiscating their assets on the other side of the Bravo River.
However, the verdict opens the door for a major Mexican glass manufacturer to the United States Supreme Court with an appeal against three irregularities.
To begin with, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States insolvency law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure sets out bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it would indicate ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
Basically, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created, which determines the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without a vote by the branches of the internal corporate structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, Mexican law allows for this possibility.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose corporate debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors - who opposed Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. "soup" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited - would not have obtained a majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37 percent.
This figure is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, Gonzalez Sady’s family firm will appeal to the Court of Appeals for a re-evaluation to take place with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since initially only three of them voted.
If he fails here, he will seek a review of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
What is significant about the case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae unit detailing Vitro’s procedure under the Insolvency Act and pointing out that the company has made it easier for itself by resorting to agreements signed by the two countries.
In addition, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules designed for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for both debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
Unnoticed for several months, a criminal complaint by the Mexican aviation unions against the former owner of the company Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who was accused of fraud, lay on the table, and according to the pilots' union, the container had already overflowed.
An instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit with the National Banking Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, accusing them of obstruction of justice.
According to her, the Audit Office systematically refused to report to the Attorney General’s Office of the Republic on the transaction carried out by that entrepreneur in which he withdrew 198 million pesos from IXE bank from fideicomiso F/589 on behalf of Mexican Aviation.
The funds were probably directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens gathered at the campus of the Universidad de Caribe over the weekend to approve the creation of an association to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge trade and distribution center with products from a "land with a big wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which at the bottom would include a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
In the past, Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) was able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental site that would partially devastate protected areas and which is the origin of all resistance to industry.
The end of ACTA
The Senate’s request, ignored by the government and demanding an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, was obsolete, according to the Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial.
As is well known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect those short-term ones, Homex is putting investment certificates worth 500 million pesos on the market.
This series is the first of four identical ones that offer repayment of interest every 28 days.
A competitor is born.
The merger of leading information technology companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet has resulted in the creation of a company called Competival, which will focus on the software services market in Central and South America.
The investment in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world champion Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and traveled the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes had been involved in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior player, BSN national basketball league player, owner and coach of Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
“I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, national team chief executive and president of the federation,” Reyes recalled during a visit to the reporters of the newspaper Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived faithfully for more than 50 years with his husband, Isabel.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest movement of all, he guards those that commemorate his work at los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
“It was my best years, and I enjoyed it the most, because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with Los Vaqueros since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his debut at BSN.
“The team was then taken over by Cuco Ortiz, who was an excellent leader,” Reyes said.
“I remember Gene Bartow, who was a former coach at the University of Alabama in Birmingham at the time, telling me, ‘I’ve got a big, two-meter-tall player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me a quarterback, Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brings Bayamone a championship win, then Gausse will contribute to the next one.”
The championship, when los Vaqueros played for Gausse, he enjoyed, but only at a distance, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's placement in the national team.
“I remember the first time we beat the United States in the qualifying Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
“Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished in the quarter, but we should have had the bronze if it hadn’t been for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final pitch,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and smashed the United States squad, which was quite similar to the one that blew us the bronze at the World Cup.
The team not only had Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were the youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leone (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be injured in the team round due to 1990.
The team that may not have had the perfect squad, but managed to win a gold medal and bring us great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players expelled due to a skirmish at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico’s best player?
It was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his presence in the different leagues where he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armando Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be your greatest achievement in the federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national league had up to 17 teams in one season.
What didn't you have time to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, such as the division of youth categories by region.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete against teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I'm glad to hear that.
What do you do now?
I mostly listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, was world-renowned for starring John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new series of Dallas, died Friday afternoon of complications related to cancer, according to an official family announcement given to the Associated Press by Dallas production company Warner Bros.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved most," the family said in a statement.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
“Linda Gray, who represented his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman when he died at the Dallas hospital,” her agent Jeffrey Lane said in a statement.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest,” Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted to drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series aired, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he plays the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (a genie) played by Barbara Eden and takes her to his home to live together.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971–72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His appearances in the films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterful performance in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the stellar peak.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shot Jayar?", which was supposed to spark expectations about the emotion-filled work, when Hangman's character is nearly murdered, caused not only a huge amount of speculation from spectators around the world, but also a risk of millions of dollars in public offices.
This also helped this work to achieve a record in audience.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history after the end of the 1983 MASH series, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin got pregnant with J.R., and he threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy greedy man with a charismatic smile: a crafty businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to keep his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) locked up in a medical facility.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on his tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
That's the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of the second series have already been completed and the sixth is being filmed," the broadcaster said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on stage in New York City and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published his autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt someone or hurt them in any way," Asociado told the Prensa news agency.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped fearful patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet with them when they go into surgery and then afterwards," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it's going to be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
Starting a course that explores “the end of the world”
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible enticement: The end of the “long count” of the Mayan calendar, due on December 21, caught many people’s attention as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the budgetary abyss that some call “Armageddon of debt,” and the growing conflict Israel is drawn into, the place where, according to end-of-the-world Christians, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When you look at what’s going on in the world today as if you had 30 days left, it’s a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for the apocalyptic minded.
And this is not the only professor offering courses on "the end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Barry Vacker holds a course on "Means, Culture, and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re discussing why these ideas spread over time,” he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that drive certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, believable and impossible,” says Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Matthew Restall, a professor of Latin American history, and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, came together to organize a course with the simple name The End of the World.
"We don't join 2012 because we always count on the possibility of taking a course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "threatening doom", students must study, create projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "until the evening of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It stretched over two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, 35 of whom applied.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails asking if there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociological student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, said at Rutgers University in Camden.
Therefore, apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is only a matter of consolation or lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in the field of psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class in which this could be taught before," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no interviewed student, let alone a professor, said they believed in the end date of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Mayan predictions, and we're kind of refuting them," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at West Chester's Temple University.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back several centuries, with which people respond to changes in their surroundings with predictions of the end of the world.
The rise of this speculation was caused by the Internet.
"Jinde people don't think about it," he said.
This happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who lectures in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew of any "end of the world" course there.
“The Philippines is not taking part in the end of the world,” he wrote, pointing to an exception at the highest office.
We have grace from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years, many days of judgment have been talked about, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several said they intend to go to the "end of the world" festivities.
"I'll probably call a few friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
