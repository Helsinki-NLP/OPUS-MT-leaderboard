During the emergency call, the professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend.
While calling the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come to their house.
Lamb determined that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset at the house, and that contacts to the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter said.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would have driven 300 miles to the school’s campus, where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said the university staff heard gunfire at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb reportedly made a fateful phone call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
Eventually, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, the authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details released by state-sponsored investigators, as well as students and staff who knew him, together created the image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to the lesson.
Gautier police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in a thank-you note to the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations in terms of problems.
The student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, “as if something was wrong with him.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for medical reasons, saying he had some sort of problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of the university staff meant that the doctorate Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee him an automatic term to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb seemed to be worried about something."
Lamb won't answer those questions anymore.
After leaving the campus, police caught his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state border back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot in the yard of a house about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to the house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older guy who had been teaching her guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
The hearts of all the girls were hardened as soon as he appeared,” says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for a while.
During an emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the Gautier River arm.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a slow-lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of Sept. 5, the sweat Lamb had finished playing guitar and accordion for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"They were just a happy couple," he said.
We slapped and recorded each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the murdered professor, led the seminar in his first year and specialized in Native American and Colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boys' Student Club and Student Government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight commemoration event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to the report.
This story has been edited to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it will not recruit as many seasonal workers as last year, but the maker of toys and products says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire around 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will begin recruiting applicants this month, and will recruit staff during October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily take in employees to assist in stores and sales, to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I figured Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The movie begins and I realize that I am in the reach of what could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" is a documentary about "Back to the Future" that features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
“Back for the Future” was released 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “It’s truly the best travel documentary ever filmed for me.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The head of the UN once again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of a ministerial session of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that divisions within the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unresolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity in reaching an Iran nuclear deal to resolve the crisis in Syria.
8 Election Numbers That Show Donald Trump in the Real Light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands like a failed joke.
And some are preparing for an implosion.
But no matter how many Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they fail (for now).
10 of the last 11 national polls show Donald Trump in the lead by a double-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously question what this means for the real estate tycoon’s nomination chances.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this suggests that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, the leadership of Rick Perry made the way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could run into a general election.
But outside groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump’s will to endure and are starting to lay their dollars on a stand to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that the real estate tycoon is not just a passing phase:
Trump’s approval rating has reversed 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth University vote showed that only two in 10 Republicans have a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “excited” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "outraged" by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “enthusiastic” against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest in level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “disappointed” if Jeb Bush’s favorite entrepreneur became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pomp and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationwide inclined to the idea that the real estate tycoon has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post vote.
The same number is held at the Iowa Senate Club, which is the first in the entire country where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s the change from late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for a possible nomination of Mitt Romney.
Still, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars emphasize that the fragmented field is likely contributing to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always wins majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the dealer by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The vast majority of supporters of Donald Trump say they have already made their point.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump-backed voters say they will not change their minds.
Obviously, it can change a lot of things, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46% say they keep the back door open for change among candidates.
Still, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “violators” in his campaign announcement, immigration has been held as the main and central theme of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump’s buzz will distract key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and damage the rebranding effort.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain too.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson receive about half the support of Republican voters today, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post vote on Monday say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are “dissatisfied” and 21 percent are “hellishly angry.”
The House supported a larger share of the state's coal levies.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies in the first reading supported the government amendment to the mining law, which regulates the amount of revenue from fees from surface coal mining from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) promised MPs that thanks to this they will receive additional money from both the state treasury and municipal budgets.
The bill was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have until now, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government amendment to the mining law, which, among other things, means that the state should receive a greater part of the revenues from the company's fees from surface mining.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the method of calculating the compensation for minerals that companies will extract.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received about CZK 450 million from fees and the state budget CZK 150 million.
About 200 million crowns were spent on brown coal mining by municipalities and 66 million crowns by the state.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the remuneration from mining areas with allowed mining to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
Income from these payments should continue to belong in full to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that municipalities will receive CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million per year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by decree.
The reimbursement shall be recalculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda warned, however, that setting the fee by a government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, this is not a tax, because the state charges for minerals, which are state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money will be given to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same will be true for radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state collects from the mining fees will be purpose-bound.
For example, 28% will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mining rescue service.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would harm the municipalities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just for the Minister of Finance to improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn), elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>stí Region.
KS<0xC4><0x8C>M MP Hana Aulická warned of an increase in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for finalization.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90% long-term negotiated.
Major consumers such as power plants or heat plants should therefore not experience price increases.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, she said the increase in employment charges is bearable.
According to Milan Urban (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining before the adoption of the law.
If coal is mined even beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the <0xC4><0x8C>SA mine should be broken already for social, national and economic reasons, as well as due to the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> will lead the Czechs as the number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at Thursday's draw of the Davis Cup in India on the blackboard and this time each of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans to distribute the load over the entire quartet due to the difficult conditions.
With the heat and high humidity in Delhi, tough matches are expected, which can stretch up to five hundred.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather.
And depending on what it looks like, Navratil said during today's training of the Czech selection in the center of Raj Kumar Khanna.
With the first team and world forty Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> counts on Friday and Sunday singles.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Rosol and Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek will probably take the second position.
I would like almost everyone to be involved.
It's a little bit in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
The only question is who will stand next to the experienced doubles player who has an 18:4 doubles score in the Davis Cup.
It's probably not going to be fun.
There are options with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know who or what it's going to look like," Navratil said.
It will be decided according to the development of the binary.
The variant may be Pavlásek, with Vesely surprised in the first round by winning in doubles over the Australians.
"He's decent to the trunk," he said.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I would like to do the same performance that I did there from the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience and I'd like to bring a point," Pavlásek said.
The home team will place Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won the challenger in Shanghai last week, where he defeated the third and fourth-hundred players in the rankings.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both of them are challengers and ours have experience from the ATP Tour, but many times we have seen that the Davis Cup rankings do not decide.
"It's the current form, the weather," Navratil said.
Friday’s opening singles games will start at 6:30am CEST and may stretch due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it's supposed to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already ignited it, and it's got, like, 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at PMQ is highly anticipated
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in Prime Minister’s Questions later, and will be working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be scrutinised by the media and MEPs.
In a weekly statement, he demanded “less theater and more facts.”
He also said he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby’s leadership following his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC’s annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to stand silent while singing the national anthem in service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been met with criticism from a number of conservative lawmakers and is the focus of several stories on the front pages of newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he would "stand in reverent silence" and recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told BBC Two’s Newsnight that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economics, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in the workplace are also "creating" after Mr. Corbyn's appointment despite his position in the European Union and the government's allowance limit.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC that the Workers' Party had put forward amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a limit on benefits.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party had “very clearly” opposed the government’s plans to reduce the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers’ Party to face David Cameron in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Workers' Party, who has promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas "from the crowd" for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQs are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both “easy responses” and geared trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will represent him on PMQ if he does not attend — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also gave up the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time, as he was told that he had discussed the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics, which was often associated with PMQ, but admitted a few years later that it had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the judgement of leaders, their House leadership, and their stance among other MPs, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
"Photography in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a hard place to be homeless.
But one group of former street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound rises while wage growth in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped the following data and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was driven higher by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, GB earnings including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest since 2009, and it looked like the estimates were approaching when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after receiving a bid approximation from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% after encouraging news from rival luxury group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results exceed all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said they rose $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest drop on the index and fell by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the company to "sell."
JD Sports jumped 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in pre-tax profits of <0xC2><0xA3>46.6m
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports executive chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh higher wage costs in his firm, he says.
The cost could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague marshmallow are cheering.
The controversial building has been shut down.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be illegal and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the construction, which is to be built in the vicinity of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> monastery in the center of Prague, in front of the Prague office, and a petition was also created.
The municipality in the decision stated that there was a violation of the building law, because not all the formalities of the territorial decision were observed.
"The relevant zoning decision does not contain some elements, such as the type of land, distance from neighboring buildings, a sufficiently clearly and intelligibly described shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory affected by the influence of the construction," the decision reads.
It is also considered illegal by the municipality that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the originally discussed documentation, which, however, has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be constructed on the National Gallery grounds, but the investor does not have its valid approval.
From the file it follows that the owner of the lands proved only consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not consent to the placement of the construction on their lands, writes the Department of Building Regulations.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetta of the investment firm, the Building Code Department did not take note of the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review had already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all relevant authorities and institutions," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmallow because of the allegedly proposed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city centre in the past to protest the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses are annoyed that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the construction for the historical center of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Agnes Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Fránek, the project was changed several times.
The original form of the project from 2008, which envisaged a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NP<0xC3><0x9A>) and in 2010 the permission of the Prague monumentalists was revoked.
The new project of the company Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces was approved by the NP<0xC3><0x9A> and the magistrates’ monuments and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the accusations of opponents, saying that he never counted on the facade in pink, which gave the project the nickname after the pink-and-white candy.

On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into a car, allegedly trying to travel about half a kilometer.
At the time, it was not criminal in Hungary, he told Lidové noviny.
We knew the law enforcement didn't penalize such behavior.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to the investigative detention in Szeged, he described the newspaper.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
The policemen were said to have behaved correctly, but communication was laggard, as they did not speak English very well.
The prison, he said, was sad.
For example, 15 Syrian refugees were crowded in our cell of about three by four meters.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them had any idea what would happen to them next, Berg said.
What can no longer be confiscated?
Ask the President of the Executioner's Chamber.
On Friday, September 18th, Pavla Fu<0xC4><0x8D>íková, President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic, will answer the readers’ questions from 9:30 a.m.
You can ask her about changes to the Act on Enforcement effective from September 1, 2015 and other matters related to enforcement or enforcement officers.
Metcash Launches Rural Campaign to Fight Aldi Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash Launches Rural Campaign to Fight Aldi Invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are joining with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings in IGA stores, and store owners are selling discounted Australian Football League tickets to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and hardware retailer celebrates its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake as Southern and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA’s trade moves and generates a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA, compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will target 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that took over revenue from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in Western Australia over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in Metcash’s fixed price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax revenue, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that IGA buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash food sales to decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the fund’s senior manager, Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said business lunches in Melbourne could “highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
But it's known that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash’s grocery store earnings, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of a shift in speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have switched to counterattacks and are investing more than $150 million a year to match counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and news from privateers.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says price matching and re-equipment programs are catching up and hopes wholesale sales will return to core profitable profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side loss in a recent outcry around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior, Tennis Australia president Steve Healy said.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention through an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly afterwards, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka should have had one for Kyrgios and I should have had one for him too."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after a spasm frustrated his possible overtaking of Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakise steadfastly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for a place in the second singles match behind Bernard Romic in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against Britain.
“I thought quite intensely that in my opinion Thanasi was a bit involved in the whole dispute,” Healy said.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of a spasm in the US, but he is not the first player who, out of frustration with himself, would discharge his anger on his rocket. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say that he will not be proud of this event.
But he really handled himself very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves great recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a bit harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits into the team great and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios due to an important match starting on Friday, stating that a “mutual decision” is the right solution for everyone, but supports the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term staunch.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy that has arisen around him," Healy says.
And I think Nick has risen very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the eyes of the public he is growing fast, he has also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time outside the sun, when he will also be able to think about it, is the best solution for the team, in my opinion.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Hungary on Tuesday closed its southern border with Serbia and detained those who tried to illegally cross it to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in the country of no one, and the Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who are stuck for an unknown time on the belts of land between two states stand those who flee violence in their native lands, build tents and settle down.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants shout "Open the borders!" and scold the Hungarian police force.
Some people refuse food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, as more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
In the coming days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece, and spoke with the hope of reaching an agreement next month or at the end of the year that would take in more than 120,000 more refugees by EU nations, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary has not placed its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country as the fence at the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped pull barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are looking for a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalise the violation of a four-meter fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are quite clear on this: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the military deployment expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have been watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s domestic defense adviser, said authorities had captured 45 people who had tried to cross the border and 15 had already been captured inside the state.
They penetrated the fence with damage and are now in police custody on charges of committing offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a barbed wire tow truck.
Chaos arose at the main border crossing at Roszka, as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing, and a crowd of people arose.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cuts by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of the Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to become president, has received support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly a decision which candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground in several demographics, while Sanders has won several.
Clinton keeps a big lead among women and softens, but her leadership narrows.
Her support among men has declined significantly, and Sanders is losing only 5 points to her.
Clinton’s advantage with Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated and now she and Sanders are on an equal footing.
But Clinton still has a lot of leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit lead on Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
Approximately half of Democratic primary voters across the state say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party’s candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It’s no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters are particularly passionate about her.
Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that it’s time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
Furthermore, a great possibility of choice and agreement on the problems is cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to take the lead – a third think he shouldn’t.
When asked by the primary democratic voters who they would choose as their second choice for the party’s nomination, the most common choice was Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half of Biden was their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, the leadership of Hillary Clinton will expand from 20 points when Biden runs to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when it comes to the issue of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate acts as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have good results in some key characteristics among their party’s primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Of the three, Biden leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and credible, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15%), but 27 percent don’t think so.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as aligned with their ideological view.
As for all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions continue regarding Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of her has not affected her at all.
But among the American public, it’s a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the issue was divided in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say that this email controversy has no impact on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent say their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Most of them are Republicans, with more than 6 out of 10 saying their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and credible among her party’s voters, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see it as honest and credible, down eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think they are honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best in honesty.
Sanders is seen by more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, many voters have not made up their minds about him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ends up behind Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson gets closer to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the rest are left to seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% support in the latest CBS poll ahead of last month’s Fox News debate to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson was doing well across demographics, and that Trump was ranked among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carla Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is lagging behind, along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, completely on the go, with 10% support falling to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place together with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson improved and reached 19% support among Republicans for Trump’s 32% support.
A recent survey by the ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s trend rising, Trump decided to shoot a retired neurosurgeon blindly, and even apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Murdering First-Year Student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during an overwhelming fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and late took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Police said he had blindfolds, wore a backpack full of sand weighing <0xC2><0xA3>30 and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his destination through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood members did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
However, they took the time to change into Deng’s dress, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the brotherhood’s national president, and ask for his advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and basically preferred the welfare of the brotherhood over the life of Michael Deng," Chief Wagner said.
He was unable to be reanimated and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with a blunt object on the head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by overloading fraternities, and at least one student has died each year from overloading since 1970,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in a statement.
The brotherhood and its members must have responsibility, and this step is important for the authorities.
The grand jury of Monroe County recommended charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with overloading and criminal association.
"We want to detain not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the National Brotherhood terminated its relationship with local branches.
This Is What Happens When The Fed Raises Interest Rates
The rate rise will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy in particular, the history of a small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That is why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hikes will begin, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
“The first Fed hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
By contrast, we do not expect a gradual return of U.S. interest rates to a more common but still low level to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen in the last month or so, the expected rate hikes can make the air a little volatile.
Once the increase occurs, however, the effect will not be as dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for stocks to stop again 12-24 months after the first hike, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what would happen after the Fed's hike.
More precisely, the market for the last about 35 years often the most - about 14 percent - is heading for an increase in rates at fairly flat in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal again after 500 days, with an average return of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the chief stock strategist of the company.
Deutsche said the impact on shares tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and the return is beginning to decline.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help it.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could precipitate a recession.
Most notably, the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history when the Fed raises rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, nominal annual GDP growth was only twice below 4.5%.
Despite the fact that in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expected its maintenance, when in the third quarter it was at only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against this complex economic backdrop could be risky, and the question could arise “whether this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Market participants were prepared for the Fed’s growth all year round, and all eyes were turned to the Federal Free Market Committee meeting that took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since the 1950s, all boosting cycles so far have been in a super-leveraged cycle with GDP covering the peaks of the onset of recession very quickly after the onset of recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and still going on.
Solid yield was also volatile, as the market expects a rise in rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes policy.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the up/down cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle, bond yields fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that raising rates will bring yields between long- and short-dated bonds closer together, leveling the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, even though “we are still cautious about straining yields,” said Kathy Jones, a firmly based pension analyst at Schwab, in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospects of a tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, and volatility has increased – all characteristics of the market as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, businesses that do most of their business in the U.S. will win after interest rates rise, and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will thrive worse because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market area and their debt will also be higher.
“History shows that the ‘quality’ of stocks tends to outperform within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs’s analysts said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheet companies in each interest rate hike in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers are also benefiting from the rising dollar.
Savers can see their profits also through higher returns, but experts have different opinions about how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "stupidity"
He believes that he is becoming more and more indistinguishable from his commercial rival.
He also focuses on the BBC Music Awards and says they’re just cheating on the British
Member of Parliament Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says neither is he an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is “transforming” into Classic FM, a leading MP claims, accumulating fresh pressure on broadcasters to prove they are doing something commercial broadcasters aren’t doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio station appears to be “stupid” and increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
“Radio 3 seems to be — I don’t like to use the word ‘stupid’ — but it seems to be changing to Classic FM,” he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which opened in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are two examples that come to mind when you’re actually just mimicking what we already have on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I would not have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and making music is actually at the top level.
“I also think that Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important,” he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before because the British are less educated when it comes to classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC production element to come under fire for stepping on the heels of business rivals during broadcasts of Culture, Media, and Sport, and got to be heard by the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, a musical talent show the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges - was made "in a BBC-typical way."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" next time it launches a fun series.
However, he declined to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending royalty-paying money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be the culprit
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000.
Online sales boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for the slowdown in spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and thanks to it, many of Britain’s main streets have become ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of a steady rise in online sales, with new data showing a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest growth increase since the beginning of the measurement in 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of a steady rise in online sales, with new data showing a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rate over the years and go back to the year 2000, the situation has always rationalized over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG’s revenue index, told The Guardian.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago, when customers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore seems to disappear.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was adopted from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from shopping before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases and toppled several retailer websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which makes shoppers bargain again, may keep customers from making more purchases.
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of a crane in Mecca and bin Laden's family was sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets of Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has blamed the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a crane crash in Grand Mosque, Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims down the street.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose the path and paid tribute to the victims as the first of the fallen made his final journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
The sad message passed by the holy place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 people who died after the fall of a crane in the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj will take place in Mecca and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the crane arm on top when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi news agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English service of the disc agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's executives were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to uncover what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims co-ordinate before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
Royal decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, running major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of an apostate whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The crash occurred amid strong winds and rain just days before millions of people in the kingdom were killed on a pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must go through at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials determined that one million riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) would be donated to the relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently wounded.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
B&Q CEO Says East European Low-Cost Traders Are Already Trending
Britain is increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is on the verge of growth
The result is the opening of 200 Screwfix trades aimed at traders
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Edited by Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent for the Daily Mail
Britons are putting away their hammers and brushes and handing them over to trained East European craftsmen to work at home.
If you’re good with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY work at their home, according to the company’s CEO behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the household chain, says the large increase in the number of trained Eastern European traders offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix stores aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Laura says she wants to hire more women at B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in a store make better halves.
Currently, most of the workers are male.
She said there is a need to address rising demographic trends, which show more women households doing more homework than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says: "We still have mostly men working in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, who make 80% of their purchase decisions.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading firms according to the UK’s FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect equality between men and women CEOs.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in the fact that it has a half-representation of women among employees, including an executive and a CFO.
Ms Laura says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it was not difficult to find good women to take with us.
Kingfisher reported a decline in both mid-year profit and sales after the group took on the cost of closing stores.
The result of the trend of Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
December's contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Miroslav Kalousek, Vice-President of TOP 09, who emphasized the principle of merit.
Zbyn<0xC4><0x9B>k Stanjura, the chairman of the ODS MPs, said that a one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better if it were in standard valorization, because it would be reflected in the coming years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to arrange it," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), according to which next year it was to be valued beyond the scope of the law.
Marx defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which, in her opinion, is not rosy.
According to her, a higher valorization next year would mean a budgetary impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating each hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valorisation has decreased.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opalka (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M), pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and beyond.
The right-wing veto would complicate the payout in December and possibly make it impossible, he said.
Therefore, the chairman of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Roman Sklenák, proposed shortening the deadline for discussing the norm in the committee to ten or 20 days, and the right blocked it.
The committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should be worth a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money comes mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions are expected to increase on average by about one hundred crowns.
According to the pension amendment, people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December should receive a contribution.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their right to a pension in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to apply in writing, no later than the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valued in January, by a rise in prices and a third of real wage growth.
This year the pension is 41.5 percent of the gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
Last year, according to the state final account, the state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
Old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all statutory expenditures.
The average full old-age pension increased last year by 104 CZK to 10,714 CZK, according to the data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided for the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
The billionaire had the senate seat, according to the Russian media.
In the Federation Council, he was supposed to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Tsukanov, as the candidate of the ruling United Russia party, defended his post in Sunday’s elections.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by the governor from among three candidates, whose names he will announce before the governor’s election.
After the election, the senator will be selected from three candidates.
A complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
Although the Kremlin has found an exception for Yakunin, he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, who is not covered by the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger has ended.
The last drop in the main hero's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Jan<0xC5><0xBE>urová decided on her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he is on a similar journey with his wife Olga - Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerová.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live in dignity and freedom again.
Desires to regain control of his life - and as a solution, he chooses to escape from the past, Nightingale told the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedic form a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would go to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ek, with whom he had already worked on the series Invisible.
Still, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with convalescence after a serious illness, surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's obviously a puppet athlete.
Before filming the next scene, he always asked where he was going to sit.
This time he rode his bike, climbed rocks and even climbed hills.
And all this in record-breaking tropical heat, the director noted.
According to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ka, women marry a tiger to make a rabbit out of it over time.
They spill some food on him, but they close the door right away so he doesn't think of playing tiger outside the rabbit farm.
And that’s what we’re trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who can have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and well-meaning.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to seal her husband to death, Bajgar said.
In parallel, the film also depicts the fates of Jane's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Tá<0xC5><0x88>a Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the sons-in-law of Erik and Pepík - Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben of Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google has pledged to provide an additional $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing into Europe.
This was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charity branch of the Internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled part of Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ko's visit for criticizing human rights violations.
The Czech member of the European Parliament for the ANO movement Pavel Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday, because the Azerbaijani authorities canceled the official part of his visit today.
According to Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Baku justifies this by the EP resolution from last week, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka was a co-author.
With the decision of the Azerbaijani party, Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka lost the possibility of talks with official partners and also the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive branch, as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to CTK specified.
The resolution condemns "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European officials to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent conviction of Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadija Ismailova, who advocated for exposing corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building an air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky, during his visit to Novosibirsk, did not rule out the creation of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have such plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has a long-standing naval base in the port of Tartus, which has been used as a service and logistics center.
However, according to Russian press reports, since the beginning of August, the supply of Russian weapons and military equipment to Syria has increased.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from existing trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to establish an airbase near the city of Latakia, which remains a bastion of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, U.S. commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Tuesday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria, the third phone call they have had in ten days.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow next week to voice concerns over the accumulation of Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Assad's support a "lost bet."
He said the goals of Russia’s policy in Syria are rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has turned Syria into its own satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but it is not entirely clear, according to Earnest.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main theme of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today’s Russian press speculation.
On the contrary, the Russian leader is not going to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas at all.
According to a report in The New York Times, the US government does not rule out that President Barack Obama may meet with the Russian president during a UN meeting.
Opinions among White House advisers are at odds.
TASS quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin did not yet have a meeting with Obama on his New York agenda.
Sesame oil is used during the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing the seeds cold, all the healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, for example, gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common cause of death of Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, sesame oil helps.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, your pantry should not miss sesame oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of gallstones.
They are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, gallbladder problems mainly affect overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be successfully used in the liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should beware of goods from exotic food stores.
Producers from Asia often use fried seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
However, the oil will lose all its active ingredients, said Ladislav Ha<0xC4><0x8D>ecky, executive director of Bohemia Olej z Kraslic, a Czech company that produces organic virgin oils cold-pressed.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can squeeze eight kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin label.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is good for heart and vascular diseases.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
According to research conducted by Jarmila Hamerska at Masaryk University, 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, already at 180 °C it begins to overheat.
It is better to use it, for example, for seasoning salads and is especially suitable for diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids are the most cholesterol-lowering.
With heart problems, you need to pay attention to the amount of total fat and calories consumed.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
When it comes to the energy value of foods, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrialized products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last the same as the sesame and hemp for 9 months.
Storage in the refrigerator will extend the shelf life even further.
Old oil is known by its bitter taste.
There is no downside to the downside.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Technical hemp seeds are one of the so-called superfoods, which is why hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This label is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body and must be taken from food.
Particularly important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is suitable to be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not need to be afraid of using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best-selling oils in Bohemia.
It sells 500 litres a year.
People often take one tablespoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Hemp oil is not very tasty, but it will strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of grillers are Americans.
There are 1.4 grills per household.
All over the world there are various competitions in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs behind.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have not grilled in their lives.
The vast majority then grill several times a year.
In order for the grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to marinate the meat a few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is best for this and at the same time leaves healthy substances when grilling?
In general, during the grilling process itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that a large part of the oil begins to lose its taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body of beneficial substances that are otherwise obtained from them when consuming oils from dishes prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, experts from Bohemia Olej z Kraslic in Sokolovsko immediately recall grape oil.
It perfectly complements the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by the unique property of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, as one of the few oils, it preserves its health-promoting substances, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Bohemia Olej, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
Therefore, grilling can be used in two ways: marinating and grilling.
Marinating meat and fish will preserve their juiciness.
When preparing the marinade, three ingredients must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
Add the apple cider vinegar, for example, to soften the meat.
The spice in turn gives the meat a taste and the oil preserves and adds the right cut, advises Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because it is one of the few oils that can penetrate dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are distinguished by the fact that only a few drops of them are enough to prepare dishes.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to linseed, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grill with oil to prevent burning the food.
Preparation of attachments is also an essential part of grilling.
For grilled meat and fish, practically anything is suitable - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, Hot Summer salad.
To do it you need: • 1 pc peach • 1 bunch of arugula • 1 cup of chopped cucumbers • 1 cup of lettuce leaf mixture • 3 tablespoons grape oil
In a salad bowl, add chopped arugula, chopped cucumbers and chopped peach to the salad mix.
To taste, salt and pepper, you can also season with ground chili and soy sauce.
Finally, drip a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can then sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: not only does it depend on the medication, but also on the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an ergotherapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, the care of these patients also includes social legal advice, recommendations for housing, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can fundamentally affect the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors warn, the passivity of the sick makes room for the activity of the disease.
For example, regular exercise has been shown to significantly delay the time when the patient needs some compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not succumb to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That is why the website Give yourself a chance (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give yourself a chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
With multiple sclerosis, there is a saying that the earlier the disease is treated, the more likely the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medova from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important in people with multiple sclerosis, which most often deals with weakening of the lower limbs or imbalances.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It is really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, Primary Director of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Educational Medicine at the University Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another benefit of regular exercise is that patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
"The exercise also releases endorphins and the person feels good after it," warns PhDr. Kamila <0xC5><0x98>asová from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine of the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By affecting the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This directly interferes with the psyche and immune processes and stabilizes the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called sparing, now we know that they need a targeted load," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolá<0xC5><0x99>, Head of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physiotherapy is to be able to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including job placement.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergotherapists to ensure that each person receives a compensatory device tailored to their needs.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people are shocked.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a great burden - the loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we have to go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them in such a way that they eventually come to the conclusion that even with a disability it is possible to live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová-Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, the airbuses would not fly.
Aircraft manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
New aircraft are full of titanium or lightweight and solid composite materials that no one knows how to make and process.
Yet, in addition to super-precision, computer-controlled machine tools, in addition to autoclaves for shaping composites, you can come across something as common as apricot knots.
In the drum, which resembles a sugar wool pot, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are milled in a pile of furnaces.
"Nobody has come up with anything better yet," smiles Ivan Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>, CEO of the air door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
At the premises in Prague Let<0xC5><0x88>any, the former Letov produces complete doors for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Through the doors, part of which is being assembled in Prague, passengers also enter the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world’s largest passenger aircraft Airbus A380.
There is also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the torque keys are adjusted twice a year by the company.
If the yellow sticker does not have an inspection record, the Prague plant should explain what to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who travel regularly to check whether the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
Human senses have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There are 1500 rivets on one door to the A320.
The riveters have to knock them out by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer falling, they can tell if the rivet has already been properly shattered.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
During the check-up, a trained touch will come.
When the controller swipes his finger over a row of rivets, he knows if any of them are out of tolerance.
Then he'll pick up the exact deviation meter.
The flight was powered by the L-39 training aircraft program before 1989.
But in 1991, not a single one was made.
The company had to quickly find new contracts.
At the time, it worked with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a tender for a supplier of emergency doors for the A321.
Boeing's suits weren't so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee long-term stable deliveries to Boeing," Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained locked if Letov had not attracted the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the International Aerospace Industry Association in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
In 2000, the assembly of door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the upper deck doors for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries to the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoera, we would not have gotten these big contracts on our own.
Maybe we could make parts or small parts.
Partners want a 20- or 30-year supply guarantee, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> explains.
Last year, Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
Exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not produce any doors to aircraft.
Obtaining certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated inspections to keep them costs millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We need to retrain employees, equip the equipment and re-certify the whole process, adds Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Now, the company is finalizing a process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the previously harmful cadmium to human health.
They received the assignment from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing are coming to check out the concept of the entire line.
Then we show them the production.
They're gonna check our lab, too.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, bringing the Dubsk way of how customers check them.
The Prague company is rewarded with long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embraers stands and falls.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
This does not mean, however, that you can ask for any price.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, hundred pieces made.
The price per piece continues to fall to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If not, we will lose, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Half of the hall, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are being completed, is still empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the curtain, a new semi-robotic line for riveting and mounting doors for the innovative A320 Neo is being built.
Riveting is accelerated and refined.
"This is the trend that the assembly in aviation is taking away," Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
Sales have a future line secured.
Airbus said it had ordered 3,278 A320s so far.
Just a few meters away, a complete door assembly line for the upper deck of the A380 will be built.
This is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualifying tests such as installing some electrical and electronic equipment in the doors for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it is expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"This is a huge credit for the company, since it can process composites in addition to metal materials," Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> proudly says.
However, Latecoere is getting to the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place in the Letov area where it is located.
Before the French mother’s arrival, the company had 180 employees.
There are now 800, and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing overtake how many hundreds of new aircraft airlines order each year, they don’t have to worry about the job.
Despite having contracts for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague’s Latecoera faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to repay the loans in September.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, they exchanged some of their loans for shares.
The creditors acquired a 37.4 percent stake in the company by a capital increase of 57.4 million euros.
The company’s debt fell by two-thirds, i.e. 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company has signed new shares among its existing shareholders for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222.9 million.
In total, it raised the share capital by EUR 280 million.
The entire group benefits from growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
The average growth in orders is expected to be 4% per year until 2017.
In the order book, it has orders worth 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to a four-year production.
French media say Latecoere is finally able to breathe again after years on the drip.
The Czech plant in Prague Let<0xC5><0x88>any is important for the groups.
The group contributes 16% to the group’s revenues.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
MEPs supported a larger share of the state's coal levies.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received about CZK 450 million from fees and the state budget CZK 150 million.
About 200 million crowns were spent on brown coal mining by municipalities and 66 million crowns by the state.
The amendment also envisages an increase in remuneration from mining areas with allowed mining to a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
Income from these payments should continue to belong in full to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that municipalities will receive CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million per year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by decree.
The reimbursement shall be recalculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda warned, however, that setting the fee by a government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, this is not a tax, because the state charges for minerals, which are state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the money will be given to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same will be true for radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state collects from the mining fees will be purpose-bound.
For example, 28% will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mining rescue service.
Today, the draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would harm the municipalities affected by mining and the region.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just for the Minister of Finance to improve his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn), elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>stí Region.
KS<0xC4><0x8C>M MP Hana Aulická warned of an increase in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for finalization.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90% long-term negotiated.
Major consumers such as power plants or heat plants should therefore not experience price increases.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, she said the increase in employment charges is bearable.
According to Milan Urban (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining before the adoption of the law.
If coal is mined even beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the <0xC4><0x8C>SA mine should be broken already for social, national and economic reasons, as well as due to the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve is set to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain inactive for a while and keep interest rates in the 0-0.25 percent range.
It’s a historic event because it’s been a year since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank could be able to get off the zero ladder and begin the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy was doing relatively well, recovering in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against the move.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
Shooter at Delta State University Leaves Message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day his colleague - wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he could take it back, government officials uncovered on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called police around 10 a.m. on Monday morning.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send officers to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "cute dog" in the house that "will not bother anyone", but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not present himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the shooting took place in the house.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb saying, "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she’s the only person who’s ever loved me.”
After leaving a note, Lamb embarked on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University Dean William LaForge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "obviously something was going on in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday’s statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss’ romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was “no evidence” of the “love triangle.”
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for more than seven years, said she was "a great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shocked" by the whole case.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, according to the Sun Herald, Prentiss was working from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not "go to jail".
When police caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a curriculum vitae published on the school’s website, Lamb received his doctorate in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He suffered from leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All of these things certainly take their toll.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during his defeat to Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back left this injury in tears and knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless intervention by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into PSV space.
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double fracture of his leg and is now in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow, and then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It’s awful – a guy who comes to Manchester at 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture of the leg will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he plays again this season.
Moreno was lucky not to get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly procedure with both feet.
A tweet from Shaw’s account said: “Thank you to everyone for their messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger.”
Related: Manchester United reported injury to Luke Shaw in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was unable to see this moment.
I only saw the ball pointing in the other direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after the procedure by Chris Smalling.
Do you think David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: when a child loves a book, it doesn’t take long for them to learn it almost by heart.
You can't be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of children's schemes to name a favorite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax chose it, a 1971 fairy tale by Dr. Seuss.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues, "Funny, touching, creative and with strong content, that's the kind of thing I liked to read to my kids because there was always an image or message behind it that I hadn't seen before."
Well, except that in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the plot of the book based on an extract from the 2012 film, which added more characters and details to fill in the brief original text.
"In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is the summary of the book, which records the name of the object of love unknown by Dr. Seuss, whose 1991 died.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron reads as a summary of the film Lorax, which is found on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the hearts of his children."
Being an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not get acquainted with the story of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being devastated by the greedy, tree-cutting industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, a bent, mustache-like creature who speaks for a tree.
Most likely, such a relatively minor PR task was given to an assistant who had never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text likely came from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of omission by England, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team England has chosen for this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat it suffered last time in the trial series will be less likely.
I would also not directly rule out winning guests.
Alastair Cook’s party may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this bat line-up, and collective thinking is also strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the trial series, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England in the season and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is a tough one for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged on performance.
For example, there were no question marks around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I’ve mentioned this before — players are their best pickers.
For a few more half-century, Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will arise.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performance was not 100%, which is not surprising to me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much probation time a batter gets to show up is a tough one.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton had a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you might complain about is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was at his best — but that wasted opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and he's a batter that I rate very positively.
He’s an x-factor cricket player that we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all this will depend on the overall composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting side by side with Cook, who would get another extra spinner while he kept the four quicks, has been raised, and I have no objections to it.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't shoot, and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
Immediately he succeeded for three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, I was intrigued as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a bow, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors opted for youth.
You will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition, it seems that England has made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
Appointing Mahel Jayawardene, a batter from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches can be a master move.
He is one of the most beautifully playing guys who will bring a wealth of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood arrives in part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and ruthless spark to the team.
I always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes was given a day off, just as Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree on this, coaches and selectors do not make a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on results.
Such decisions should never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
The unthinkable strategy of David Cameron’s renegotiation to keep Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble every day without electing the brilliant Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to lead the Workers’ Party, or the TUC will take over the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
The aliens also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States are already fed up with Britain's self-centered agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes that most did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they did not want to do so even if they were to infringe on social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The prime minister and the chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants an unbiased Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with the long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14 years), and Kohl (16 years).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It’s hard to watch them break their legs in helping Selfie Brits who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they themselves don’t want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"The re-negotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing worth negotiating."
Europeans know to their own detriment how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the press oligarch barons are of the EU, because they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
They can vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, the deceitful Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels correspondent of "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-free villains, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo-non-Overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a raging gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so she won't have you for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of a repealed EU constitution that was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him a card of firing.
The press never forgave him either.
But the dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted my back amicably in Westminster on Monday — I told him not to waste any more time with me — seems to be in danger of re-adopting the Murdoch boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of engaging the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin’s official attitude towards Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He says he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the furious tendencies of the Ukips and the wild shores of Tory's little Englishmanship can certainly agree to it.
The same thing Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said on radio and television this week when his inner scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his grandfather fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary’s game was much more interesting.
But fighting to stay "at all times" - Benna's phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell was saying, or what JC was saying to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey — remember, it has touched me — the discipline of news remains important in the ages of day-to-day television broadcasting, and especially in the whirlwind, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal that social media is.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take the support of the Workers’ Party in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic twist on EU membership – in line with their besieged Bennite economy, an anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is central to dogmatic quarrelling.
As with his twisting about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC's campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their homeowners.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on UK concessions when it seems useless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by Brisk’s “weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the Monday opening of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize review about electronics published by Public Health England
The government-sponsored statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in its report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency released a "multilateral" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the extent of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet magazine last month attacked the “extremely fragile base” on which PHE based its main findings.
Two other experts, who write for BMJ, disputed the claim, which was allegedly “built on rock or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They state that the public could expect that the PHE agency’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people summoned to draw up an analysis of the Multi-Criteria Decision (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also endorsed the BAT public health mandate in the Sustainability Report, it says.
One of the 12 attendees admitted funding from the e-cigarette maker, but not the funding he allegedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for selecting the panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting at PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
The report "explicitly admits" the lack of "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claim that “there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes act as a smoking route for children or non-smokers” was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the BMJ claim had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers will die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to explore the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly emphasizing the current evidence – that even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking – we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give their right hand" to hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said the royalty should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs, which are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, in complex broadcast times compared to its rivals' biggest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC is outsourcing and broadcasting programs that would certainly have been broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of talks on the future of the BBC.
If you keep licensing fees that I’m not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, you should reduce production at least for programs that others don’t produce or distribute.
They are broadcasting The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, meaningless.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Honestly, the other channels would have put their right hand behind them.
I can't understand how these are a public broadcasting service.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty by catching up with ratings “because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support.”
His commentary on the BBC’s most popular shows echoes those of former Sky CEO Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said even the BBC's more pampered public service programs "go to BBC4, where quite often audiences cannot be measured, but they exercise their authority and can argue as they prepare for their hypocritical mission of justifying <0xC2><0xA3>4bn in royalty income, "But of course we do all these obscure programs that nobody looks at."
They broadcast them at a time when no one is looking at them.
Regarding the royalty, Johnson told the commission: “I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a big sum, but for people for whom <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot, I’d be surprised if they pay that much, because they don’t watch the BBC as much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now previously classified as educational — it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% of radio production — and should take public broadcasting in Australia and Canada as a model and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the topic of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, of which only a handful have been broadcast on television, and contact commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
RELATED: Scientists Can Read and Write Brain Activity Using Light
The researchers said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activate outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation – an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are inserted into the patient’s brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when they are placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found, the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the body of the worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves act in the ion channels of TRP-4, which is found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells to which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
To control the nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contained ion channels of TRP-4.
When ultrasound was applied to the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where the modified motor neurons were turned on.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light.
However, Chalasani was told that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatments to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.

The collective, called Special Patrol Group, has helped distribute it across London and through the "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is <0xC2><0xA3>6 per piece of Allen keys, which reportedly "gains access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists switch to working with activists as part of protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the posters against the arms trade is the health of the subway passengers.
The Amnesty video was viewed by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by VCCP, working without a fee, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the arms trade ads – he saw a blank spot on the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s show them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They were playing with creating more realistic, risky corporate ads, but “by adding colorful colors and animation, we’ve made it appeal to more people.”
“They’ve done a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair,” said Amnesty International’s Tom Davies.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab unveiled an order from the U.S. military for the "on the shoulder launcher AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped head that delivers amazing effects from behind armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for College Life
Eleven years ago, I moved into college as an inattentive nineteen-year-old boy, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those whom I bothered – and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving onto the tracks can range from slightly on the nerves of going to totally shocking.
It’s tempting to babble: telling people where you’re from, if you’ve taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why “you honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because people, it’s just a yeast extract HAHA, I’ll be in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe too - ask and show interest.
It controls the conversation and helps you find the people you love and the ones you wouldn't be talking to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were issuing fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night venues, and communal public spaces, but they are also rooms where people dress and trim their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts come to college.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of dorms turn into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, sociable, and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, “I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you.”
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write them instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
One guy in my dorms used to be invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you started going to university on top of baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and performing with a plate of baked cookies seems a little less weird, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering home-made delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and maybe it all ends up assigning your face to a tasty surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and stiffness are likely to interfere with others pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in college.
Stealing a whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Check with the owner of the milk twice.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even if they rage inside.
If someone steals something from you, it’s annoying and you have my sympathy – but try to deal with it a little more maturely than my roommate, who traded her milk for a dishwashing detergent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make sounds that distract people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass a little bit, because it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When they finally calmed down at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours, then played her own music out loud, locked the door, and left for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same college as you?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be terribly embarrassing if you mistook your roommate for your future wife, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day, and maybe she would also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you can't tell your heart - but if your sexy roommate is not 100% your future wife, try to talk to your weaknesses at least a little.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between laughter and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about keeping them safe by hiding something from them - never ruin someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in a bottle of water, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their stuff to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a difficult time already during her pregnancy with today’s seven-year-old Vítko.
His father broke up with her and she was alone in the preparation and upbringing of her offspring.
I coped with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the baby and looking for positives in it.
With uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we wouldn’t be alone for long, Eva remembers her first pregnancy today.
Already then, she met on the Internet at the chat room of the elder Vasek, with whom they began to talk about their favorite films.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek even brought Eva and Vítko home from the maternity hospital, but he did not take up the role of stepfather.
"He retired from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in It 3.
The motif of the third series of the Czech television series is the search for happiness on the second try.
She managed the care of Vítka and financial security of the family thanks to part-time work and great help from her mother and aunt.
Eventually, Vashko’s affection for Eve did not spoil the prospect of being held accountable for another’s child.
They definitely got together around Vítek’s second birthday and he now understands Vasek as his dad and also addresses him in that way.
Although Vasek already has two adult daughters, he says he enjoys fatherhood at the age of sixty and also devotes more attention to children.
In addition to Vítko, a two-year-old Leontynka and finally twins joined them.
"The villagers came into our family naturally, perhaps because my mother never talked to me much," Eva thinks smilingly.
Not enough space?
At least we're close.
The twins, Emma and Ela, were born by caesarean section after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a violation of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excess in the blood of pregnant women and are manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually spontaneously disappears.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Vasek's happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emi<0xC4><0x8D>ka was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s niece also works, who managed to take her in and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer from the ICU to the room I had her with me, describes the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity hospital until the doctors agreed to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two pounds.
Waiting for the birth of the children in the maternity ward was not a joy.
"I was mad for my husband and my children," recalls the mother, who was four times sixteen, in the ward.
She and her husband were also considering signing a reverse, among other things because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen and the doctors released Eva and the twins to home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by <0xC4><0x8C>T1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
A large family can be humbled.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with an electric two-paner and tight conditions.
The house did not grow, but Vasek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make cooking for six people more comfortable.
If it gets rough, we'll take turns getting a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere in particular, and not the size or frivolity of the house.
So far, we've been getting along very well, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and rolling babies sometimes cross, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side to any situation.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek's work as a lighting engineer in the film is not a guarantee of a regular income.
He occasionally travels to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In her 60s, she says, she manages to take care of the family and children’s finances physically, but how long will that be?
"I realize that given our age difference, I'm going to be the one to feed this family one day," Eva admits.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly an employer.
And when it gets worse, my husband and I can take turns getting a taxi, jokes the cute blonde.
Apple has a yo-yo effect.
It's all the displays.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a stronger chassis or a display that recognizes the power of touch, these are, in short, the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s current trend is that each new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generations, whose weight has slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference to the detriment of the novelty was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case with new iPhones.
Compared to last year’s iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight of the smaller model increased by 14 grams, while the larger model increased by as much as 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year’s bending affair in Apple’s pockets was greatly troubled.
The chassis of the novelties is thus made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which also projected on the weight.
But the displays have a much greater impact on it.
Apple used 3D Touch technology, thanks to which the displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, the display had to be equipped with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
Thus, the weight of the displays of the new iPhones has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
On a smaller iPhone, from 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of a larger one, from 19 to 40 grams.
With the iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component used.
The weight of only 143 grams is also achieved thanks to the slimming crust, which touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, the battery is the heaviest element used, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is visible in the display.
The 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus weighs 192 grams.
To what extent the new display technology will be practical, it will have an effect only during use.
First users will be able to try it as early as Friday, September 25, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will start selling in selected countries.
Have champion breakfast flakes been around for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists managed to find a find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern man from different times, including wall paintings, remnants of tools and so on and so forth.
But in layer 23A, which according to the tools is dated to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that very much resembles the remains of a breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oat grains were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing today's so popular flakes.
At this time, the grains are first soaked, then dried, stripped of the envelope, the so-called lung, then steamed and crushed flat.
In the Paglicci Cave, grains were discovered, which were apparently heated or cooked, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this is indicated by the traces of use on the two stones in the cave.
Thus, the scientists could not prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that a complete process of flake production was taking place in the cave, but the similarity is really very noticeable.
We also have no evidence of how people could have eaten the flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly even warm, of course, is quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes are about twenty thousand years ahead of agriculture.
New reports of stations in the Transport Company of the City of Brno.
So once again I listened to the announcement of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Hnusá<0xC4><0x8D>kova, Ghost, Phrase, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was a little louder, so the male voice was a little less clear than before when the stops were a female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is more recognizable than the deeper male voice.
Although DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose this from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of a bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for a nice couple of decades, so I know the right names of all these stops by heart, so I do not need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who do not know in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, can be confused and can finally, where they accidentally arrived, then claim that the stop at which they were supposed to get off was not at all.
Perhaps the choice of the announcer--but better the announcers--should be made again, and this time colored by the usual traffic noise and engine rumble, in which the speaker's whine is almost lost on the bus.
So that we do not have to listen to the names of the stations Vodní Her<0xC5><0xA1>pice, <0xC5><0xA0>mírová, or then Diving in the creaking salina, to which I moved in Komárov.
I suppose my old hearing did not suddenly deteriorate so much during the one day that the announcer of the stops had changed.
Before that day, I understood the report quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the trackman's notes.
Nowadays, few people know what the so-called comprehensive checks were the biggest and smartest during the Party’s rule.
I took the liberty of recalling it.
The bus was late.
I ran into the dispatcher's office when the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't bump into Comrade Chief, he came a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher remarked as I entered the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Tell me I'm on my way to the precincts for a minor mechanization review.
You can't do that, there's a checkup today.
They're all so fucked up, they're terrified.
What's this all about?
"You'll see," the dispatcher grinned.
Next time you will too.
I ran into the hallway.
Then the door of the chief's office opened, and the chief appeared.
Tight, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, fastening two buttons on my uniform jacket.
"Good morning," said the reply, and I rushed to the second floor without realizing the cold, sinister tone with which the old man had replied.
"You're kidding," said Engineer Eva, an elderly lady whom I respected very much.
She was even the chief before her comrades deposed her.
There's checks, and you're coming anyway.
How many times have I asked what these comprehensive checks are, but no one wants to talk about it much.
They say they come once every three years, everyone has to go to them, and it's pretty annoying.
At least for some.
I said I'd see.
I pulled a folder with periodic reports out of the drawer, and there was a phone.
'This is Holcman, come to me now, 'said the chief's voice.
What's bothering you?
Now we have met and nothing ..." I muttered, but no one answered me, each with his own thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I've come on your order," I checked in, barely entering the chief's room.
The chief sat at his desk, looking at a notebook.
'Comrade Mechanizer, 'he said after a while, without raising his head, and still carefully examining the notebook,' I don't like your behavior at all.'
He threw the lamppost on the table, leaned against the back of the chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, grumpy gaze.
I was insecure.
What's going on? What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised himself that during those few months in office I worked very well and that he is extremely satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
Realize that you're a track-distance technician and that's what you have to do.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I stuttered that I had used such a greeting since childhood, that I had been so raised and that I saw nothing wrong with it.
It was like a red turkey rag for the chief.
"You're on the socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work," said the grumpy chief.
And besides, you're still confusing your superiors.
One time you say "sir" and the other time you say "comrade".
But to you, I'm not a Mr. Chief. I'm a Comrade Chief.
Deputies are comrades deputies, top trackmasters are comrades top trackmasters!
Remember that, please!
I'm sorry, sir... Comrade Chief, but... I greeted you with a common citizen's greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
'It's not your preference that you're not in the party, 'said the chief coldly, who in the meantime calmed down a little.
We'll talk about that later.
Anyway, remember, the chair upstairs isn't prepaid for retirement.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good with the person in question.
For a moment he stabbed me with a cold, pickled look, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his exalted tic-tac-toe.
He was only a few years older and was playing God, actually a comrade-god.
Jovial, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as he liked it at the moment.
They all yelled at him.
Well, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, as all party members, but also non-party members, tickled him.
But the chief tickled many, especially those in whom he could exercise his superiority.
Right now, he's been busting my ass for complete bullshit.
I thought something about my ass, and it cost me enough to not shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back to being a train clerk, let alone a train clerk.
What would I feed two kids from?
And there's a house built up!
I was crying, but I controlled myself.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
'That's all for now, you can go, 'said the chief, and began to look again at the notebook he had in his hand.
I was summoned at half past twelve.
Everyone in the office was already there, and when asked what and how, they said yes, it would be good.
Only Jozhin said, as was his custom, that they could not throw us all out, because the comrade chief would have to do the work alone with his faithful, and that there was no danger.
He emphasized the word "comrade" as if he knew why the old man had wiped me off this morning.
There was a nice meeting in the chief's office.
Comrade Chief, at his desk and at the long consulting table, other comrades who were to decide my official existence or non-existence.
Kádrovák, chairman of ROH, staff secretary, special-purpose clerk, sort of a counter-attack in the military, and deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from scratch.
An ordinary railroad worker, he was tapping frets or throwing gravel with forks.
But also a former guard.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him at the time, that he was a pretty beast.
The evil tongues claimed that he had graduated from school in the seventh grade, had learned nothing, knew nothing.
And when the crime scene was canceled, he ended up on a streak by a pickaxe.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief nodded and asked me to sit down.
There was a little soul inside me, an insufferable cone in my throat.
Kádrovák read the opinion of the civil committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I am married, I have two children and so on and so forth.
So far it's good, I thought, and I've been breathing a little better.
Then the opinion of the street organization of the party.
He copied the opinion from the Citizens' Committee, perhaps both written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of long-time party members refused to appear before the screening committee and subsequently left the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The staffer noticed and stopped reading.
The chief nodded that he should continue.
And then it just got worse.
I was a member of the city committee of the SSM and there I was nominated as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and I had a wedding in the church besides the national committee.
I've failed the party's trust in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from the list of candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both my children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I arranged a church funeral, even though she was a former party member.
With all this, I express a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When he finished, only the tapping of the chief's pencil on the table interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
And I kept saying to myself, "Communists -- superhumans, communists -- superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could fix the switches without some fucking checkup.
But now?
The career of a railroad clerk took over before it began.
Back in the squad?
I don't think that's going to work. I'm sure the chief's going to take me out for an hour.
"Comrade, how have you verified the comrade in question?" the chief interrupted in a tense silence with a question to the Kadrovák.
Well, according to an ex-employment report.
You got him here?
Obviously, Kádrovák hadn't done it twice.
He blinked nervously at the edges of the sweat droplet, as if he himself had been checked.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
"Yes," said the chief, with a hint of playfulness, which was often a harbinger of a thunderstorm.
At first glance, all praise, learned with distinction, graduated from industrial studies, worked in the task pay as a locksmith, met the norm on an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essential is missing.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade?" he asked again, feeling that it was beginning to turn against him, and that he might not even have to be one very soon.
A comrade here gave it to me on board.
Is that enough for you?
'Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct to join the platoon, 'said the squadronman.
And there's no need for reviews, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were assigned to the technical function, this piece of paper was enough for you," the chief said dryly.
Kádrovák blinked nervously and had no answer.
"It's all right, we'll talk about it later," the chief concluded, and the kadrovák was obviously relieved.
So far, he's done it.
"What about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden he's yelling at me, so it's over!
My eyes were darkened, I was overflowing with heat.
There was a surge of remorse and accusation, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That by inserting an incomplete opinion I mistook a comrade-in-arms officer, I did not understand why the opinion was incomplete when I received it from a man in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element that, at the time of the building of real socialism, encourages the breeding of religious darkness, indeed, even participates in it.
That, yeah, there was a lot I did, or maybe I will, and I quietly prayed that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I flew out of mechanization.
I didn't care if they took my pickaxe.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
'That's enough, comrade chief, 'said the party chairman, sharply interrupting the chief's Levites.
Here the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he made a stupid mistake!
He has already received his punishment.
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side for a while!
In order to reopen to him, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The ignorant guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so literate, or does he parrot phrases from party training and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who's gonna give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts for correction!
It's your party duty that no one can take away from you!
In fact, it's a party duty for all of us, too.
Here the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
As a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman finished, no one even made a noise.
No one expected such a turn of the situation.
At least me.
'I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman, 'said the chief, coldly, in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that's what I was about to conclude.
They all shook their heads in agreement, but it was obvious that they did not believe a word of him.
"So I was confirmed to be an independent care officer for basic assets," I whined as I returned to the office, and then I cried.
Luckily, except for engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
She listened silently to my incoherent narrative of fresh experiences, and in the meantime I calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I wanted coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the stove and made cups.
In the meantime, she was talking about cadet practices.
As one opinion, often full of praise, they put into a person's hand, and another, in which there is all sorts of filth, they send to the new employer.
But I didn't end up where I should have ended up, but on the streak at the picket fence, so the comrades in the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our recruiter?
He only cares about where he would eat or drink, and so it turned out as it turned out.
'He'll get it from the old man, 'she remarked maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Be careful of him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a far worse chief, no humanist.
Zero from a picker with great power.
The water for the coffee began to boil, and then the office was filled with the scent of just poured coffee.
I put a sugar cube in a cup and quietly stirred the hot potion.
Maybe I'm out of the worst.
I'm not going to be fired now, and I'm not going to have another checkup in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief, I won't forget today.

The symbol of the stranger revived.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is spinning again after years.
It is visible from a distance because it is located on a fifteen-meter high mast.
People from around the world call it "the wind on Chlum".
For the village of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the village received for the occasion of a gathering of natives in 2010.
"We asked for a badge and of course we wanted to have a fan on the badge, everyone in the area knows it," said Mayor Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The Chlumské wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a reminder of our time: it reminds us of the time when local people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum was rare in the past centuries.
It was not until 1910 that the representatives of Chlamydia decided on a solution that would then be suitable until the mid-eighties.
In the village near the branch at <0xC4><0x8C>íchov, a seven-meter-deep well was dug.
Three years later, the well was supplemented with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranice in Moravia at a cost of CZK 2,400," says the memorial inscription on the ground fence of the mast structure.
After several repairs and falls of the wind wheel, the pump became operational in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the struggle for water began to be written: that day a new water supply system began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump has remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a local rarity.
The dominance was activated at this year's gathering of natives.
It was only in 2008 that the people of Chlum decided to repair the windmill and put it back into operation.
They made a replica of the original bike - reduced by half a meter in diameter.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, but the same year it had to be brought down.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose a suitable material and the wheel could not resist the gusts of wind.
Then the Chlum dominance rested for several years dismantled under the roof.
However, since June of this year, the wheel on the high mast has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the village had the replica of the bike modified and re-installed it on top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws utility water from the well only into the blind arm of the overflow.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected it, because there was little water in the well.
At least it was empty.
"In the fall, we will disconnect the windwheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," Mayor Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the windmill was included in the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole Highlands.
A similar element in the emblem is in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in the Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov region, in Ku<0xC5><0xBE>elov in the Hodonín region, Partutovice in the P<0xC5><0x99>erov region or in the Police in the Vsetín region.
No offense, but I don't know Lafata, Goian's supporters confessed.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone in my career," Goian, 34, smiled at the pre-match press conference.
We were coached by Georghe Hagi then, it was a shame that we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta.
Except we won’t lose this time,” Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team, is a key supporter of the Greek team.
As a stopwatcher, he will face the onslaught of the Spartan Offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Spartan Hybs about the Greek duel.
And he has a partial idea of what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know Fatai well, who played in Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their games at the time.
“I know he’s a very good striker, that’s why he went to Sparta,” Goian said.
He did not name the other players of the Prague club, so the direct question came whether he knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and, with a slightly reproachful look, aimed at Czech journalists.
The helpless expression on his face meant, "Why are you asking me this?"
After a moment of silence, he let go.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know this very well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is their organizer of the game," observed Stanislav Hejkal, a Spartan assistant.
Goian has already had his best years, but he has a very interesting football biography.
At one time Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City were interested in him, but from Steaua he headed to Palermo, Italy, and also played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European cups, fights for victory in the Czech league.
For me, he is the favorite in this game, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
“Like Sparta, we will try to win,” Goian said.
I am in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD>, who is looking forward to the opponent from the Czech Republic.
Yeah, me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to trading of the company’s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on what is happening in the company, says Daniel Bury<0xC5><0xA1>, financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the headquarters of the group, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
In order to enter the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalizing a prospectus of the securities, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and the related share transfers will take the form of a non-public transaction with the participation of existing shareholders only.
Therefore, no public subscription shares or new investors will be offered under this operation.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said in a statement.
The company has previously stated that a potential share offer could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of the objectivity of Czech television in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the main Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time the main news broadcast of Czech Television.
And how did she cope?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can broadcast today Czech Television Events.
About 80% of the news coverage was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Until the first minute, when the Czech Television reported on the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the attacks of migrants on police officers euphemistically, they ran out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal bars), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already underway - judge the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs – large scope for NGOs to criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian Children in the Czech School: The Story of Integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as an opportunity.
Journey of Refugees - <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses the terms "refugee" or "refugee" and not "migrant".
What is most striking is the fact that <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses pictures of young children and women in its illustrations.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that is unparalleled from communist agitators.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
Once upon a time, when I grew up in an apartment building, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
I've moved fishbowls to the Umakart toilet.
Fishfish, insects with imperfect transformation, i.e., not undergoing that transformation from a caterpillar to a beetle and a cub looks like an adult, only it is small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me, and I was not lazy enough to destroy them.
First by hand and then chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystals for their destruction.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, this eliminated them successfully.
Later I dealt with the pharaohs in the same way.
A box of some kind of juvenilizer, which the ants brought to the nest and then he did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I turned away.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from my life that intervention in the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can be replaced by another.
The truth about fleas and bugs I wouldn't hesitate to make my karma worse by killing them.
In our new home, my partner and I agreed that if we didn’t have the fish crawling down our necks, they should eat the flakes of fallen skin, some of those invisible algae and the like.
Their peaceful existence was disturbed by the spider after a while.
It was a common type of rectangle that had long lived on the ceiling.
We thought it lived on occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he lived with us for several years, we found out that he mainly feeds on fishfish and that their number was probably kept in a bearable numerical state.
Through confidential regular contact with each performed need, we found out that it was a female.
We witnessed romantic courtships with a partner about a third smaller, how carefully he buzzes on the threads of the cobweb so that he is not eaten before he reaches the coveted copulation.
It took about three days when they did not move and did not react to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the multitude of little spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
Some of them were eaten by their mother, some of them fled elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
We don't know if she went elsewhere or died, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
True, a little less, probably the daughter of the old lady of the toilet.
She watched our behavior from the ceiling for a while, and by moving it under the toilet she assessed our non-attack as friendship.
The numbers of the somewhat multiplied fishnets declined again, and the spider was quietly watching its normal activities to secure food.
Our ecosystem has not changed throughout the year.
In the meantime, our daughter has grown to an age when using pottery was already a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal spill of its contents has already consumed us.
We urged her to use the toilet more and more.
The daughter, however, found an excuse to maintain her bad habit in that spider she could see very well at when she was wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider, having luck in the house, didn't take it at all.
Crying and screaming, she enforced her potty.
There was no need.
There was a time when the spider had to be commanded in order to advance the development of his daughter.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and thrown through the balcony into the garden somewhere.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt ugly after such a long cohabitation, as if I was throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the fish would begin to appear more often and begin to multiply in a geometric series.
A week, two weeks, no one showed up.
I began to speculate on the cause.
I wondered if the ants-like spider had somehow grown up there, that the toilet environment was not as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were already swarming again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their link to the spider must have been due to the fact that if they could not see it, it was hidden somewhere else and they were in danger from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection to their predator, and its rapid disappearance triggered some kind of alarming reaction in them.
Especially since I have no illusions about their eyesight.
They showed some light shyness, but they didn't react to waves or quick movements.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot about the potty.
All that remains is to attract a spider.
I'm already sending my wish on the air, and I hope they didn't abandon me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use Cyclone B.
Albert Einstein's Ten Sayings That Enriched the World.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive into everything so deeply that the result was always an astonishing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
His special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions, came into the consciousness of people.
It is also impossible to ignore his explanation of the photo effect or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complicated for many that they prefer easy examples for closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
But it wouldn’t be Albert Einstein if he didn’t find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: A watch near your sweetheart seems like a minute; a minute in a hot furnace seems like an hour – and that’s relativity.
I took the liberty of selecting from his whole pleiade of famous quotes these ten that literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No number of experiments can ever prove that I was right.
But he can prove me wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, what then reflects an empty table?
I don't know what they're going to fight in World War III, but in World War IV, they're going to be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
To know little is dangerous, and to know much is also dangerous.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem on which my life would depend, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The most difficult thing in the world to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive myself not to include Einstein's formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are waiting for changes for 1.5 billion.
"It's a success, considering that all four of them have been in the black all year," said hejtman Stanislav Mi<0xC5><0xA1>ák.
The total profit of regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million crowns.
The share of this is mainly higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
This also shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford to make more investments.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>, Vsetín, Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> and Zlín, thanks to this, constructions will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period of time when we mainly bought equipment is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them the top health care can not be done, the regional deputy for health care Lubomír Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as justified the plans.
Changes are expected in all hospitals.
Construction workers will be in hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now being selected for almost CZK 300 million.
A dialysis supplement is planned in Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
Hungarian Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> wants to add a new intern for about 200 million to the central pavilion opened this year.
And Zlín’s Bata Hospital is waiting for the long-delayed construction of a new central income and an internal one, which will require three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, this is a major and often the biggest change in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, for patients and doctors," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Prousková, the hospital's director, for example.
The five-story building is expected to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and an intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
The changes, which are mainly recognized by patients, will affect all regions.
New buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, they have only one toilet on the floor, the beds are not adjustable, the windows are leaky and the paramedics do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our intern was built 35 years ago and now it is on the verge of its lifespan," said Pavel Calabek, director of the Zlín hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-story modern building connected to an emergency reception.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute wards in one place, in addition to the new premises.
The same model is already half-finished Hungarian Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
The central income already stands and within three years the internal one will be added to it.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained the director Petr Sládek.
This hospital is the only one in the region that can afford its own funding.
Profit is still the highest and it did not reach the loss even two years ago, when, for example, the Zlín hospital faced almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients of the Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE> hospital will also see improvement.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new appliances and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the capture station will be completed, then the addition of dialysis, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance imaging, will begin.

No one explained to me how I should keep the refugees in the country when they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) complains after negotiations with his European colleagues that other Czech states are pushing for the adoption of quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but refuse any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic, when they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not receive an answer, so we wanted quotas to be removed from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came to the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot speak of migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have visions, they are going somewhere, they have relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we would be able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine it.
We did not receive an answer, so we wanted quotas to be removed from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about it for a year now, and we say this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Recently we dealt with forty thousand, now it is one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in the area?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country have the ambition to come to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is, from Syria and other countries, is close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don’t really want to come to us, but we have already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn't it be possible to take more of them this way?
We are committed to accepting 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even with the 1,500, there will be 1,100 people with whom we will deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we treat the ones we've captured.
It is a big question, and we will discuss it with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or in Hungary.
Because Europe treats them in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that has not yet been reached, it may happen that even the 1100 will not be held on the territory of the Czech Republic, and they will leave again when they arrive in Germany.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will settle the asylum procedure with them.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, then almost 98 percent according to European statistics receive international protection.
Then they will receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will relocate.
This is the second project in progress so far, and we have only progressed there in debating with the churches the possibility that they might be able to help them get a job, a place to stay, and so on.
But it's a long run.
You said that at the ministerial meeting with us, the other countries were not willing to discuss.
But isn’t the Czech Republic just rejecting quotas, but offering no solidarity to unblock the debate?
What kind of solidarity do you think this is?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can come to them, the news spreads within hours across all the camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders – simply to deter these migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Let them know that they have no chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany last year alone.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, courts, public prosecutor's offices.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, then the fifty percent of what the social systems spend on them today in vain could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day that Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far will it go to tighten border controls?
We were afraid to catch hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we handle.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it as standard.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, with Hungary it is difficult and the Greeks - that is a completely useless story.
So where is the breaking point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day for two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacities enough to trigger the emergency plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an emergency government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are several times a day in phone contact.
If this were to happen, the government could sit down de facto immediately and by one resolution decide to strengthen the police with an army, let's say a customs administration, or a prison service.
Is the state of emergency now declared by Hungary in some places the most extreme option?
I don't think we can get this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have a Schengen border only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarming information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests rather that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debts at the last minute.
This is to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Soccer has paid off its debts.
The footballers also got their money.
Slavia Football Club stood for the first time on Tuesday due to insolvency proceedings in court.
Almost three months after the application was filed for about 20 million crowns by the company Online Services from the Pacific Samoa.
Slavia's lawyer Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
I must say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the new owner of Slavia was a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC, as well as Czech billionaire Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC5><0xA0>imán<0xC4><0x9B>.
Obviously, the money from the new owners arrived at the club, and at the last minute.
This is evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vr<0xC5><0xA1>ovice club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
"Everything was paid between 9/11 and 15 September," legal counsel Slavie Mládková said.
Who did Slavia pay for?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, Slovak representative Milan Ivan or Czech midfielder Mario Li<0xC4><0x8D>kov.
Slavia also paid the fee to agent Alexander Losenicki.
Already on Friday, the club paid the due fees to the city of Prague 10.
Thus, de facto, only the claims that Slavie contradicts remain part of the insolvency dispute.
According to the club, the obligations have not arisen at all, or there are litigation about them.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in case of loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which can be documented by the account statement," Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that was overdue is paid," Mládková said, adding that only outstanding or conflicting liabilities were not paid.
It is also certain that the judge will not decide in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the aforementioned debts.
All evidence will then be evaluated.
A decision can be expected in November.
The judge ordered the hearing to resume on 3 November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

An incredible number of welding curves, simple adjustment and extensibility of the welding source allow you to quickly respond to changing requirements, resulting in reduced downtime, the need to change the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with cutting-edge welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality of welding.
It stops wasting time and does not waste material or repair defective welds.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less downtime, more welding and higher profits.
This year’s novelty premiered in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these honors very much, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world’s leading manufacturers boast similar systems, but thanks to the difference in software and parameters management, FastMig X is among the world’s top.
Delivery times are also pleasant for those interested, which range around three weeks.
We have already established the first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will surely expand after the Brno fair.
We have been its regular participants for over twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before, emphasizes Miroslav Streichsbier, Head of Kemppi in Pilsen, for ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, which is why the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka could be built so that she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka could have been stamped more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could have been constructed in such a way as not to cause two landslides in Prague’s Stromovka, according to the production director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovic.
He said this on Wednesday evening during a journalistic tour of the tunnel.
He said it would be about half a billion dollars more expensive.
The car will be open to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It is always a trade-off between price and safety.
"The tunnel could have been drilled more safely, but the costs are growing exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the country collapsed just a few steps from where it began to break out with a safer and more cautious method.
"If these measures had been applied 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The Blanka Tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav director Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told Euro.
According to the original intention, the construction would cost 17 billion crowns.
If you add to that the VAT that doubled during the construction period, you have twenty-one out of seventeen billion.
When you add to this technology, land purchases and engineering, valorization and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from the 37, B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to Get a New iPhone Operating System with the New Apple Update
A new operating system may be requested in Settings when you click on the "General" tab and select "Software Update".
When it is ready, it will offer you the option to download and then install your phone.

FedEx profits mixed, 2016 fiscal outlook reduced
FedEx reported disappointing results over the past quarter and a huge decline in its annual profit forecast due to low freight demand and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would be hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx said it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average interest rate increase of 4.9 percent, which will take effect in January. 4, and higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy or large parcels, starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth from the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, chairman and CEO of the company, said the company “has delivered solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing industry and global trade.”
The hiring plans were announced a day after rival company UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, roughly the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx raised $692 million, a 6 percent increase on last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, less than $2.44 per share, as predicted by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales grew by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenues in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has strengthened the FedEx ground unit’s performance.
Ground income grew by 29 percent in the last quarter, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while profits fell in freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
They finished Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent year-on-year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve lawmakers will spend two days sitting at a 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table this week deciding whether or not, after nearly a decade, the time has come to raise the key interest rate.
Raising above them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-Factor too close to a predictable decision to be announced on Thursday about whether the US economy is ready to launch in the wake of an unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since the end of 2008.
While most data shows solid economic growth, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed into adding to volatility by raising its reference rate of federal funds—no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
“It’s clear that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch first,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient justification to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is a cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% chances of an increase.
This would point to a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, only if politicians soften the fall by promising that no further increase is in sight.
On Tuesday, the industrial average of the Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The meeting was triggered by an expectation that Fed policymakers would hold off rates this week calmly, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now,” he said.
If they did, the Fed’s policymakers would have to go to the extreme in their programmatic statement and hold the financial markets by the hand so they don’t panic.
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects a rate hike this year over the spring and early summer, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
While job creation slowed in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 percent the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Salary gains showed signs of upswing.
And while inflation continues to run below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 16% below its record in May, as investors feared China’s slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market bounced back somewhat this month, and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of its May high.
To the Fed’s policymakers, the turbulent market situation provides a complex calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
“In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
A mere hint by then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might be “simplifying” their monetary expansion in the market triggered cramps around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but they also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more of an art than a science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc’s global wealth-management strategy.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that “the Fed has a history of exaggerated financial market movements that seem incoherent with economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting policymaker on the Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for rate hikes, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over three sessions “despite limited identifiable impacts on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prioritize concerns about financial stability only during the Great Depression, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil is not even close to this level, he said.
“You certainly don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets have become angry,” said Peterson, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinese Quarter
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's Chinatown, not Thailandtown.
The market/warehouse is the only point of contact offering a staggering range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car part if you need some engine oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to climb all the aisles.
If you’re hungry for all this shopping, go for a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading booth (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and lots of the items are sold in bulk.
The limit of fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and debone you, even fry it if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to the massive freezer compartment, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter watermelon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter blanks and more.
Who shops here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as single families and individuals.
Wide aisles meet shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Location: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was denied by the House.
It will not be possible to increase the maximum permissible speed up to 150 km/h on selected sections of motorways under favourable conditions.
This was decided by the House on Tuesday, when it accepted the Senate amendment, which rejected the increase in speed.
The amendment to the law on roads will now go to the President.
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto a law allowing a speed of one hundred kilometers.
Transport Minister Dan <0xC5><0xA4>ok (for ANO) also opposed the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such speed.
On Tuesday, he supported the Senate version of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow for an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane ones.
At first, the House extended this possibility to include motorways on which it would be possible to drive in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now accepted his proposal.
With the approval of the Minister of Transport, the senators also removed the authorization of the traffic police to have the last word in the regulation of local roads, which are taken care of by the municipalities.
The Senate version, approved by the House, also envisages that sewerage, water supply or public lighting cables can be stored longitudinally under the surface of roads.
The municipalities would save on the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to care for road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land in question.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to handle towed vehicles that are not reported by owners.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles, which will not be reported by their owners within six months after the notification of the towing.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on second and third-class roads under the threat of fines also for forwarding companies.
The amendment also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic vignettes instead of paper vignettes, which will continue to be used after January 1 of next year.
According to the government, this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system.
The <0xC3><0x9A>stí Expressor is going to court.
He faces 10 years for overpriced welcoming of citizens.
The case relates to the allegedly overpriced project Welcome of Citizens.
The police wanted to prosecute the MP Zuzana Kailová (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The trial is currently scheduled for two days in October.
According to the prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused damage of at least one million crowns, according to the prosecution.
The plaintiff relies on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, the former members of the city management unjustifiably allowed the company, which organized the welcome of citizens, to obtain the property benefit by virtue of their office.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered the then head of the magistrate's department of urban services, education and culture to contact five related companies in the tender procedure.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, the town hall cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted by the city to the administrator, and only the company Darothore applied for the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least $1 million more.
Both accusations, led by the goal of ensuring that Darothore was awarded a public contract for the organization of the Welcome of Citizens event in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, acted in a long and coordinated manner at least in contravention of the requirement for the procedure of caring for a good farmer, writes the prosecutor.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore would subsequently charge <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome of Citizens action a price that would be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
In the end, the city paid only one part, about CZK 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was overpriced by at least one million crowns, according to the expert opinion.
Mandik has previously denied any violation of the law.
I have not committed any crime, I am innocent.
I do not understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, saying that the city under his leadership had only built on a similar project from previous years.
From 2008 to 2010, the event was handled by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
Initially, the criminals wanted to accuse MP Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the House of Representatives did not issue it for prosecution.
The criminals therefore postponed the case in her case, but they expect to indict Kail after her parliamentary term ends.
Welcoming citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of baby supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly let a dog go after a refugee.
Then they got journalists to delete the tape.
Hungarian police said they briefly detained the AP cameraman on the Serbian border and forced him to delete a footage of a police dog allegedly knocking a refugee to the ground.
The Hungarian government, however, disputes the allegations.
The alleged incident occurred Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border into Serbia via a cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
The refugees were attacked by police, and one of them had a Syrian attacked a dog with a basket on his snout.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," said Muzi.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything was noticed by one of the policemen and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Police took Muzi to a dark place near the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then he was ordered to delete the tape.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days of work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP has sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovács.
She called the police’s behavior unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to worry about the government destroying legally obtained material.
Kovács, referring to the police report, questioned Muzi's account of the events.
He said the police just wanted a reporter to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Dogs can bark -- they're trained to scare and scare a little bit, but they certainly didn't attack," Kovács says.
The unpredictable Champions League.
Winning at City will kick us, Juventus believes
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of City.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Neither team created a lot of opportunities, but we had the ball on the boots longer.
"The reason for the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team collected in a competitive match after 636 minutes.
That last season's finalist Juventus was exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league as a defender of the title only a point and with a score of 2:4 is only in the 16th place of the table.
The return to Etihad Stadium came as a surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supporters - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
In Manchester they were replaced by Pogba, Mand<0xC5><0xBE>uki<0xC4><0x8D> and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, maybe thanks to it we will get on the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we are on it, we are among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive phase.
My players deserve this result.
"Before our goal, we could have scored 0-2, but Gianluigi supported us," Allegri praised goalkeeper Buffon.
"We've burned a few good chances," said Yayu Touré, City midfielder.
We have to take the experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye, Angelo, goodbye to old Germany II.
Before we go on with the immigrant issue, we should realize that all the media fuss around is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today, newspapers and the media are full of children carrying their parents on the dusty roads of exodus.
And this automatically evokes guilt and compassion in a person - that is, in a European person.
Well, they are not just desperate babies coming here, notice in the footage of landing boats to the Greek islands that the baby is not so much visible on them!
Recently, we have lost sight of images of boats heading for Lampedusa, refugees from the French border near Menton, where thousands of young men lie on beautiful promenades.
Mostly young blacks.
And the pictures from Callais have also disappeared, where these eaters and black men are waiting to see if they can make it through the tunnel below the English Channel.
I guess he doesn't get it anymore.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
Too much of it was fake.
So, when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow hidden that it is not just the unfortunate children from Syria, but also the detached - for the elderly: fashionably dressed - young men.
Their muscles look like they just came out of a fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite the fact that it was private, suddenly a large group of cars arrived at the beach.
But no ham.
And out of them came young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They walked into the beach, all dressed in branded clothes and shoes. In the hands, of course, smartphones.
They didn't care that it was a private beach, and the staff - the Turks, the Muslims! - were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken all the deckchairs.
Those who did not lie on it and were in the sea were unlucky.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the heads of the hat with a nail, white and colorful adidas on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and began to feast.
They crowded the tables around, crowded themselves with the white and gray bar guests sitting next to them—reading to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
Incoming blacks drank beer directly from the thirds - as in the U.S. series?! - on the beach threw empty bottles around.
They kept yelling at each other.
It was not in English, of course.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight out of the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in branded swimsuits, especially the young ladies -, screaming and screaming in the water, mothers and children and seniors fled terrified, and in half an hour there was not a single non-black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
Regardless of whether you are a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about it.
The waiter said to me in a low voice that evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
'Well, they certainly didn't have it from work, 'the waiter said.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had a massive gold cross about 20 centimeters long around his neck.
And the women were like jewellery.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
'You've seen them drink, 'the waiter said.
They don't smuggle drugs, they don't use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105 it was not so important for me.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
But the Secret Service and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they don't know.
Approximately 1.5 million immigrants arrived in Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-politically-correct politicians, as if intellectuals, and lobbyist and economically important groups attached to them, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognised main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, but also the EU's leaders and television, including our own.
For example, recent TV images about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of those of Moscow television in August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunbathers at the station, but most of all - the Old Germans - the Muslims welcomed their fellow-men.
For weeks, they were babbling in the news on Czech television, saying that, according to some research, almost all Germans are for the arrival of emigrants.
However, those who have been in Germany for only a few days know that it is a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, the famous public opinion poll organized by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Service Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees a week ago.
This was also reported by our television.
However, they did not say what happened the next day in Germany: that in the poll for the article it turned out that 94.5% of Germans no longer want any immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the survey.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly declared in November 2010, that is, five years ago, that “our multi-cult effort has completely failed.”
“Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society.”
"All attempts at such coexistence have completely failed."
In a country where there are four million Muslims, she said, the strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has failed. Today they live here with us, and we have been fooling ourselves for a while that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, where we say to ourselves that we just live happily side by side, has failed.
Completely failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
This is evidenced by the escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
The Euro-German Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, a member of the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one that Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play the guard in the concentration camp from the minute - has shown up, as he has done many times.
It seems, especially under the impression of recent statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, with the exception of some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, and solid Germans?
Who for years have tried, at least outwardly, to deal with their terrible past of the aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is sown in the soul of Germany right?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right in stopping with all his might the attempts of the Great Germans to control the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was decommissioned, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Great Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After the Marxists’ attempt to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of, for example, ecology, which was by the way one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism.
We would say sunny.
The German elites had long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving all those warriors against the atom, enthusiasts seeking a paradise for all, silently supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our Forest Must Live.
In order to satisfy restless young people who want to do something different and better all over the world, they fully sided with the fighters against heating the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they have forgotten that there is also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic current that considers all Slavs a difficult verbiage - since the days of Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements by Schulz and the German ministers openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leadership Germany.
Which must be listened to without apology.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we add to this the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it, as always, is capital, especially German capital, which suits and which thrives on the fact that Germany, in fact, through banks and the Union, controls most of the countries of Europe.
The sunflower pseudo-belief first led Germans into the swamps of ecologism and multiculturalism, and today it has brought home to them, and may bring back, millions of Muslims.
Who, seduced by the sirens’ voices, will soon bump into a wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and begin to revolt.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors with force, again a part of its inhabitants - but an ever smaller part, it seems - can go ideologically delirious, but in the end reality will catch up with it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when there are public protests by Germans against incoming Islamists?
Will Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time, but certainly not assimilated, come to their aid in order to adopt local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans come together in fear of the Islamization of their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up who will protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superhuman Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that Europe has provoked by the support of the sunniest ideology, that is, the ideology of the elitist and essentially totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the unbridled treatment of the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, this will not go well.
Finishing tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of sneaky sellers: scare them to death.
Just knock and the rugged knocker will knock on you in a way that weaker nature may not just stand.
A resurrected head will wipe you clean and drive away even the hardened ones, and a resurrected statue will accompany (or rather drive away) the persistent salesman.
Perhaps it is a pity that a talking knocker can not be purchased in reality.
In our country, too, it would be useful to chase away a lot of peeks and scum.
Oxalis corniculata (Oxalis corniculata).
Tiny weeds that tolerate dry environments.
And so it is located among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is one of the expansive weeds, but looks like it makes a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
It is unpredictable, it thrives in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, is easily adaptable, modest and unpretentious.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth watching and taking photos.
The beauty of the detail is under the scrutiny - yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Breastfeeding Diet
The Brazilian pediatric society SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the importance of good nutrition when breastfeeding by using images of babies sucking from breasts painted by depicting junk food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide infants with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to excessive energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are recommended to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic make-up of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's is trying to take the lead on the Today Show
The escape of Karel Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the costs of the consequences of the leak of the liberal leadership failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
Nine is a morning show projected from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance did not seem to matter to Aussie TV viewers as it averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals compared to 330,000 viewers broadcasting Today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but the number was only behind last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise averaged 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand, has an average of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson himself would have been able to make a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a clear "yes".
The X Factor by Seven retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, smoothly beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of Andrew O'Keefe's new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30) had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers — enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the second night's drop in The Chase Australia ratings, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute show, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy – but who will he choose?
The Secret Revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally found out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor's with is shrouded in an insurmountable mystery.
And the three girls who stay standing won't reveal who's the right one to finally get a rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut for Thursday's final
All three women chanted lyrically about why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons to want to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler as to who will win the heart of Bachelor.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the one best suited to Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship since one day.
“From the moment I walked into the house and watched the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible, and I still think so during the course,” says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
Together they are good and pleasant.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood could make a great couple.
For her own sake, she claims that during his last visits at home, she realized that Wood could be "the one."
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this wasn’t just a game anymore – I opened my whole heart to him now,” she added.
I asked who Wood would choose if she didn't look mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls equally - it's between Snow White and Lana undecided.
The bachelor is broadcasting on Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after he moved to the United States and a lot of teams asked after his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was made by an Australian rugby league convert on the first kick out of a pitch at a 20-3 win in Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula showed he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said Hayne also received encouragement from special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only take care of the next game.
In the first quarter, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake against the Minnesota Vikings.
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing when he left the field by mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his NFL career he could not have imagined.
"That happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal area led to a Queensland triplet.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested for guns on a Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The U.S. has defended the emigrants who demanded the replacement of their property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple applied to the state for compensation under the Out-of-Court Rehabilitation Act.
The court first assigned them the requested amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the appeals court changed their claim by granting them only less than CZK 90,000, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The Supreme Court defended the emigrants and applauded them for the amount originally claimed.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the <0xC3><0x9A>S with a complaint.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the then-current legislation - although then it represented an adequate compensation in relation to the confiscated property - now reaches only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of the interveners as in the restitution of eligible persons who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to obtain compensation earlier," said the judge-rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the <0xC3><0x9A>S sided with the emigrants.
"The <0xC3><0x9A>S has repeatedly advocated that the ordinary courts proceed in restitution cases in such a way that possible inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation is always achieved, i.e. the reparation of property wrong caused by acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA will now be played by Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová.
Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová, by the way, became the world’s youngest Evita when in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Peronova in the first Czech production of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spiral Theatre in Prague.
To return to the same role, he says, "Today, Evita's demands have not been matched by the performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monica Absolon for the role of First Lady of Argentina.
I saw Moncha in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Suddenly I saw a whole new concept.
I’m pretty much in favor of more modern adaptations, but this one is just particularly good.
"Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol's directing is original, lightweight and contemporary," says Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová.
The imaginary handover of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at the Monika Absolonová Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 pm at Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
Don’t Cry for Me Argentina (Don’t Cry for Me Argentina)
In a limited number of performances, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol will also jump off the stage when he plays the role of President Peron during the filming of Karel Roden.
Due to public interest, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
The main female role was originally directed by Monika Absolonová.
Alongside her, Karel Roden appears as President Peron and in the role of Che Peter Strená<0xC4><0x8D>ik.
Legendary songs from the workshop of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prost<0xC4><0x9B>jovsk<0xC3><0xBD> are performed by a live orchestra under the direction of Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof Marko, who participated in the first performance at the Spirála Theatre.
4 people killed after police fired rubber projectiles at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber projectiles at a crowd of protesters against a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district's chief officer, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reports that police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, known for their ability to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and has eased their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, violent clashes have killed at least 40 people, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, lawmakers in Kathmandu voted to establish a draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We definitely shouldn't panic right now.
After losing on the ice of the championship Litvínov, you did not even manage a home duel with the players of Sparta (3:5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous entry into the extraliga as a year ago?
I hope nothing like this will happen again.

NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide, low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of Cape Verde’s southernmost islands has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) said it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries as they flee war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud published the report on her blog based on her personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family as a seven-year-old.
“We have traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” she said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like mine are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among four non-profit organizations helping refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double all posts made via google.com/refugeerlift to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria swept away by a four-year war that has displaced 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote the editorial for the new JAMA surgery study.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been done on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal at values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates an overweight person, and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that looked at two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass surgery and gastrectomy — in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who were moderately obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent of patients.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol was shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s levels of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers say.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the drug-treated group, however, this figure remained at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — which is reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c — did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of surgery.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent), and were more likely to relapse from diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to prolonged life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared to the group who tried more conventional methods.
While the new study did not show any improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, Blackstone said it was a reassuring result for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"It's here that this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with a lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after a patient’s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ve waited too long to let people know the gravity of the situation,” he said.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which deals with the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that in the present circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
“Caring for a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, arguing that “the US violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my heartfelt condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not through violent means.
"I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," he said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have taken sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported an almost 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitizer, according to the Toxicology Center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Toxicology Center of Georgia, the number of ingestions of sanitation products in children under 12 years of age reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are getting to these products more often, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the sanitizer deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitary ware because of cheap noise.
Teenagers allegedly mixed a sanitizer with an alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive fragrance of the product.
"The kids don't think it's going to hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (sanitary means) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitary products with the smell of strawberry, grapefruit or orange, which are very tempting for children, are available.
The sanitation product contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several curls can indicate alcohol poisoning.
“This is highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Control Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t just let a glass of whiskey roll around, but people leave these sanitizers outside and when children get to them, it’s a quick way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ate up to four curls of strawberry-scented sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered drunkenness in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency physician who cared for her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered vague words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the girl fell due to alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very frightening," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or make sure that sanitation products are out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation products have been associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Healthcare professionals believed that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their "evil" teacher by distributing antibacterial products around the room, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary products and forbade their presence in the room.
The police rated the failed plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the school district's discipline,
Fame: No discrepancy in Celtic
Griffiths downplays the Celtic discrepancy talk, while Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team’s unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty by ADAMA Rooney secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, giving the Dons a five-point lead on the Celtics.
Griffiths denies talk of inconsistency
This situation sparked rumors of inconsistency in the Celtics, which were denied by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates did not work under any pressure from increased oversight in preparation for the match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don’t think we’re feeling pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team Ronald de Boer says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer any rivalry between them over the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, said: "The best of Celtic games are no longer shown in the Netherlands, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the games of the Old Company and not only people from Scotland watch these games.
Turn things back to good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic stumbles a bit, but the Norwegian boss has pledged to turn things around.
Malmö's defeat and subsequent loss from the Champions League were quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now rises to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "The Celtic has already experienced bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current events.
We are in exactly the same situation - but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players a lot better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton Worried About January Reinforcements
Despite comments that surfaced a few weeks ago suggesting he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about the large purchase of reinforcements and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former Brentford CEO said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer one.”
Players who come in the summer have the whole pre-season to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage will be done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Micha's Transfer Goal Suggests Retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, suggested he might retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old shooter has been suffering from a prone ankle for two years and has been unable to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by the referee Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands by his claim, stating, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a heated moment," the striker said, "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in a Celtic jersey."
Council in Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still believes in correcting the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
McInnes is happy for 'ugly victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to cling desperately to the Hamilton Accies to secure their seventh consecutive league win and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a first-half penalty shot by Adam Rooney.
McInnes states: “There is no team that has won anything, be it cups or leagues, without winning this type of matches.”
Scottish Unemployment Remains Unchanged as UK Total Unemployment Rises
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK (5.5 percent), according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a period of three months, the number of workers now stalled at 2,612,000.
Scotland’s employment rate fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scotland’s Secretary of State David Mundell said: “The long-term government plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has risen while unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witnessed the Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, in spite of late legal intervention, I will be watching the killing of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who would witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approaches, I'm starting to worry about it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being conducted to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have formed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half hour visitation.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I’ll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeder the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the anti-death penalty process.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of the murder.
I strongly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
It is from this perspective that I will see his death.
I can't say I'm going to be objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a person I love die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after rescuing a man from Canning River.
The man from Petrh's bet to escape the police didn't work out after he got into the shallow muddy water just meters away from the policeman who tried to persuade him nonviolently to return to the shore.
Canning Vale police were summoned in an incident crossing into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, just come get me,'" said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use a safer tactic, the police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things on the run," Castledine said.
Soccer champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims organizers tried to spy on him and threatens to end the race
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He focused on the organizers and integrity department of Racing Victoria and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late-day maintenance scratch on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin’s positive cobalt swab that he couldn’t explain.
He bit his tongue on espionage charges for 18 months and didn’t want it to look like “dry grapes.”
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to keep my head up and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I would have to consider what I would do with my license.
Moody had previously released a bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity of the department had tried to spy on him.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — whom I’ll name after the question — offering him a job in my stables for finding out about the things that are done in my stables,” Moody told Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in an attempt to catch me, they completely burned.
Robert Roulston, the former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Am I supposed to think this is becoming a personal thing?
Will the RVL grow a few balls and make sure that people outside the coaching positions take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they are.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now will give them material to think about.
But I'm at a point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will put pressure on them and I will put the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach’s frustration levels have risen with the long-running cobalt investigation including Lidari, and the recent scratching in him has given him the feeling that he “could have hours of his license on the table.”
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on the day of the race "ridiculous" after clay or mud was applied to the horses' legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treatment on the day of the race, for which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver who escaped was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobra over the weekend and drove away after a collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalie confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, failing to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in stable condition at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Strikes Back to Rivals Over Wrestling Claims
Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm coach, criticized his players' actions as "setting a plan" for the two NRL favorites of the premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the Storm team's controversial victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark to Storm after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "show" of the rugby league and said two from Queensland weren't "too big" to wrestle.
Bellamy defended his players' interventions and said they focused on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation has boosted his self-esteem as his team is being criticized by two head coaches, which may mean they are afraid of being defeated by the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the last year we have not changed anything from our defensive system and techniques, in the last weeks we have only put emphasis on contact during the procedures, and this has meant a turnaround for us.
“Trent has been here for three years and he’s obviously training a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how things like that always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy downplayed Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 Premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 they were criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds disruptive, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
That’s the kind of football you’d want to play if you had that kind of player.
He said that opinion in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football – but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can’t play that style.
It makes me feel more confident because they say things like that because they’re afraid to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed out that more goals were scored in Storm vs. Roosters than in Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and non-scoring attempts interesting?
I think they are agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will definitely meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man receives $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man facing possible life imprisonment for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland received a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police looking for 100 kilos of the drug from the Solay yacht, which arrived from South America via Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting the defendants at the harbour in the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial-grade cocaine, Maksimovice’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire amount and that he could have been in the cafe entirely by chance and innocent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would have escaped.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather offered a $200,000 bail for his release.
“After reading the sworn statements of both individuals, it is clear that the $200,000 bail is a real financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said in a statement.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient, as the defendant did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on condition that he waive both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and abide by the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg Uses Girl's Phone to Entice Pedophiles to Send Pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged in to her online chat, where he had lots of obscene photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found her phone missing, and then found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She went through it and found disturbing news before she alerted her mother.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytic computers found the address and discovered a "worrisome" search on the web using terms to search for naughty pictures of children.
Hogg then told police that his reason was to “send pedophiles” onto the internet before he would “pretend to be a police officer and scare them off.”
Fiscal Attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it’s an addiction – that he’s addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he searched the computer, but said he was only pretending to be a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who had sent him pictures and why he wanted to send more.
He said he did it to entice them.
He claims he's out of his mind drunk and says he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, trembling and crying.
She saw naughty pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to filing a lawsuit for receiving or providing inappropriate images of children on June 14 last year, breached bail terms on January 25, and failed to appear in court on March 24 of that year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim has asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual offenders because he can argue that there was “no fundamental sexual undertones” in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence to October for filing a social worker's report.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual offenders before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Speaks Badly in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell earlier this year on the steps leading up to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against whistling Mr. Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was whistled and provoked during his State of the Nation speech in parliament -- a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to hinder Mr. Mugabe's speech.
“The message comes from a number that doesn’t show up, but is called ‘death,’” he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that the immunity ends in parliament, and as soon as they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, had "fears" of threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard cuts 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the company’s business services costs.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the PC and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of around $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP CEO and Chairman of the Board, who will lead the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores to help businesses transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will be “focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions” to companies.
The company was founded in 1930 by Stanford University alumni Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who produced electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to handle the shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech firms in America, is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that a tightly specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it is still September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is sure to miss at least another four English games and, from the point of view of history, its involvement in the next summer European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great pity of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back into his former form during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not endanger a career," Wenger said.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he had suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger has admitted that there is a relative risk of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. has recorded 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he made his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played in only 65 Arsenal league matches out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win a competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am sure he will, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal start the campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of being the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also unbeaten in a total of 41 games after maintaining their "invincible" campaign last season.
On Wednesday night, the stadium was shaken by a 3.2-degree Richter earthquake.
This was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned a lesson from last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and has little hope of leading the club to its first European Cup victory.
"This deployment is tremendous," Wenger says.
This has never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar images in different shows is striking, especially given how men need to open up more desperately than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under 15 years of age.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of Men, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies the friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured person had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a “healthy mood,” their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends presents half the chance of developing mental problems.
But, of course, for friendship to work, it must first be attainable.
In this social media communication with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, an immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and more successful has doubled, even though in reality we are rather isolated.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values – our personal desire for growth and friendship – that have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game developer recently explained, money really doesn’t buy better luck.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent casualties, moments watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
“My role as a listener to people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the slightest friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying “to deal with it” is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
It highlights the small moments in a man’s friendship.
As far as my assignment is concerned, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater closeness, from a network of friends and family.
So if you are going to the FriendsFest hosted by Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - a total of 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match, and Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League journey with a 2-0 final comfort win against Malm at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his Champions League debut, and this PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then they threw away a few chances, finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored the goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their way to the quarterfinals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not a classic performance of the team of Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted before the goal and later was replaced against his home team and the club where he began his famous career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win the Champions League outside or at home, so a 2-0 win makes it difficult for our opponents and looking comfortable on the defensive is a good start, although there are things that we will have to improve as the season progresses,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of three PSG team changes, which at home scored a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Ligue 1 this weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing has been branded as the man to take PSG to a new level in Europe following last month’s transfer from Manchester United, and has shown why when he ran on Marco Verratti’s pass for defending Malmö and beautifully ended up sending the ball behind Johan Wiland’s back into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected this to trigger a spectacular PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated the Celtics in the play-offs and reached this stage, entered with 9 internationals in the base line-up and five defenders and two retracted midfielders were a difficult opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjice's shot, which only just passed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they did not offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with bad passes and a miserable ending, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when it came to preparing the chances for his teammates and it was from his pass when Di Maria sent a spinning shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan headed the line for the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic passed him after a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
This put an end to Malm's thoughts about the possibility that they could benefit from the match, and only Wiland's excellent intervention from great closeness frustrated David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the alternate Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
Malmo's coach Age Hareide said: "Our last game in the Champions League was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion in Share Sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by the commodity price collapse, earned $2.5 billion in share sales on Wednesday as part of its extensive debt-reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is grappling with commodity prices dwindling as China’s economic slowdown stifles demand and sparks of doom across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore's stock prices to the top of the London stock market in early morning trades on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77% to 131.60p on the FTSE 100, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of $2.5 billion in shares is part of a broader plan to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third.
The company sold new shares at 123 pence per share, a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
They disposed of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent for the group.
Concerns over the prolongation of China’s slowdown in growth have reduced the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Washington visit to Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its report on Tuesday.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner after the talks.
“President Xi’s visit is an opportunity to strengthen U.S.-China ties and encourage cooperation in resolving issues of international, regional and shared interest, and an opportunity to engage in constructive discussions about the differences between the two countries,” the report said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is due to visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington, D.C., and then continue to New York for a U.N. meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency beacon launched by Germany has far from sealed the European crew, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal first with the refugee problem: it will systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece - rather than quarrel over the future allocation of refugees to quotas based on a quantity that is increasingly distancing itself from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the ministers of the interior of the member states changed the priority.
Rather than worrying about the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those arriving today and solve the fate of those already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential to managing migration," the ministers said in a text discussed Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds itself in jeopardy in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases the pressure.
It is reinstating border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of asylum seekers in that country.
The Central Power thus makes it clear that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
The domino effect can also be seen by the blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private conversation with his three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new at all, but the rigidity is being realized.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest refuses to establish any entry point on its territory because it is more afraid than others that there will be camps on its shoulders where refugees will accumulate at its expense.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands off the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after going through crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, still in financial turmoil and awaiting a new government, has folded its hands.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to implement the checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
"The challenges faced by Greece apply to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
It is therefore about deploying the European Border Control Agency's Frontex intervention teams in that country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen its surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," the text, which was submitted to ministers for approval, warns.
From a legal point of view, Athens will continue to have the final say.
The issue of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is approaching it.
In any case, the new emergency situation of the 28 pushed to the second place the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, raised by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by a majority of the 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise involves the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed in June during a hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven people were killed in an avalanche in the Alps, three of them Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the German authorities, a woman is also the only survivor of the eight-member group.
Previous media reports said he was a Polka.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury to her femur.
Most of the dead were 40-year-olds, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over and the bodies of the victims have been moved to Briancon for identification," Pierre Besnard, the head of the Hautes-Alpes department, said in a statement.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the summit of the 4,015-metre (4,015-meter) Dôme de Neige des Ecrins.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, chief of the rescue team.
According to him, a huge amount of snow was pouring into the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The weather service did not warn about the weather in the area today.
Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> before the match with Braga: Finally the real Europe.
Coach Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, during his premiere in the cups, managed to pass through the Europa League to the base group with the Liberec players and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
At the start of the main stage of the competition, Slovan welcomes the 2011 finalist Braga and, according to the coach, wants to impose his style of play on her.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, when every goal and every situation could have knocked you out on the way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six matches.
Of course, we want to win, but we do not have to be afraid of every collected goal, we can play our tactics and we are not bound by just a double game.
"I am very much looking forward to it and it is a real Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said at a press conference.
Bragu is considered a top team.
It will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be even harder because he does not have that name, but he has a player in his squad who, I think, gave Manchester three goals.
"It's a great team at the top level," said Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
He does not consider Braga a clear favorite.
We play at home, so we’re not outsiders.
"I think we have shown both in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen out of eleven matches this season.
He believes that Liberec can impose his style on Braze as well.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time they are untypically disciplined.
They play from a 4-4-2 layout with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the field," said Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
We studied our opponents a lot in the preliminary rounds, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we adapted the trainings to.
"And we definitely want, even though it will be very difficult, to play according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films will dominate Písek, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries submitted their works to the competition of the 15th International Student Film Festival in Písek this year.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the finals by a committee of students and teachers, will be screened from 15 to 18 October at the Porty<0xC4><0x8D> cinema.
The best of them will be selected by an international jury, said Jakub Charvát, a spokesman for the festival.
Each year, the festival has its own special theme, which is derived from the festival's lyrics.
She's a detective this year.
Richard Blumenfeld, the director of this year’s festive evenings, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And, of course, we also need to solve the crime that was committed in this year's trailer," Charvat said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student creations - feature films, animated films and documentaries.
They will be judged by an international jury, which will include, for example, the winner of last year’s award, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The organizers of the festival, as every year, prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Smeykal, turbochanson group Leletí?, playful band Zrní or Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the Bar will be coming.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first one will come from a graduate of the Písek Film School and the winner of prestigious awards, including that from World Press Photo 2014, Jana A<0xC5><0xA1>enbrennerová.
The second exhibition will take a closer look at the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
Cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin <0xC4><0x8C>ech, silent film The Cameraman will accompany Gerhard Gruber with his music and Brukner, Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> will baptize his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek, patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy that will live on.
“Young people from all over the world will continue to come together here, exchange experiences and develop common ties and film crafts,” he said.
The Pitching Forum will certainly help with this, where students can meet with film professionals, take several job auditions at the same time and get a job position.
The festival is connected with the establishment of the Private Higher Film School in Písek.
Its founders, the spouses Vladan and Milo<0xC5><0x88> Ter<0xC4><0x8D>o, organized the first edition in 1997.
Until the sixth year, it took place once every two years.
In the event of bankruptcy of the CK, insurance companies have to cover the claims of clients in full.
Insurance companies should cover the claims of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
This was decided by the House on Wednesday, when it approved an amended amendment to the law on business conditions in tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace the bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee according to the draft, which is going to be considered by the Senate.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay the claims of clients even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the regulation, argues consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuring travel agencies against bankruptcy if the amendment goes into effect.
The proposal has also been criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to leave or go abroad.
Minister of Regional Development Karla <0xC5><0xA0>lechtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Euro-compliant.
She drew attention to this year’s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, <0xC5><0xA0>lechtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to make it feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, Vice-President of TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work, because no one will give it unlimited.
"The travel agencies will have to stop their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
Member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalouska’s concerns on the basis of a survey among the CK members.
"Stop lobbying the insurance companies," he said.
The statements of the insurance companies are not considered by Okamura to be relevant, and there is no official written statement in this sense.
However, they are investigating whether travel agencies will be complicit, which Okamura says is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the removal of stairs to Czech travel agencies, also warned about the establishment.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer said.
Her proposal to delete the controversial passage was not approved by the House.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Filip (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) did not come up with a proposal to return the draft to the committee because of the alleged contradiction with the Civil Code.
Filip pointed to travel agencies who, in his opinion, could endanger consumers.
The rapporteur of the draft, Martina Berdychová (ANO), withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insured performance would not cover the entire risk, due to the verdict of the Constitutional Court.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum insurance limit of four million for travel agencies offering air travel, and a million-dollar limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of planned sales of tours.
However, the insurance coverage limit will have to be such that, in the event of bankruptcy of the travel agency, it will cover all claims of customers.
Even after the changes, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to specify which travel agency organizes the trip for the sold trips.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies before concluding the contract, among other things, data on the management and number of trips.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also envisages further regular information of insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and sold tours, on the total price of sold tours and on the amount of advances and sales for tours and vouchers for them.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agent has failed to comply with any of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will, according to the draft, call for redress or it will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts if the breach of the obligation could jeopardize the interests of customers.
The amendment also aims to re-regulate the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The request will include a report on the use of public funds in the past year, a financial plan for expenditure and a outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the lawmaker did not think about the situation if the insurance company terminates the contract.
It will not be allowed to organize trips and clients who purchased the trip before cancellation of insurance will lose it, according to the association.
In this case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One way travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be to sue the state for compensation.
Another option is to go abroad and take advantage of much softer conditions abroad, and then we will only act as agencies on our market, said Jan Pope<0xC5><0xBE>, vice-president of the association.
According to him, the draft amendment also includes the institute of bank guarantee, but so ill-considered that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since the bank guarantee cannot sound to an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, the change in current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, due to the new EU directive, the whole law will have to be revised again.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies are currently operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth about CZK 20 billion annually.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German Prime Ministers.
At the same time, it reiterated its call for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 member states.
We need to do more to help the countries from which refugees leave, or in which they stay after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will push for dignified conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said that such a signal could also be higher financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis among European countries," Merkel said.
Brandenburg Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by, among others, the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke in favor of speeding up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the prime minister of Brandenburg said.
Most of the money Germany spends on the care of refugees should be used to integrate those who have a chance to get asylum.
More teachers will be needed for the refugees to learn German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees manage to integrate, they can become a benefit for us, he said.
Matt Damon's making a difference in the film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's episode of HBO's Greenlight project, the cast of the series was interrupted by Brown, who stressed the need for alternative views on the black protagonists in the script.
“When you talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie, not casting a show,” Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted in disbelief, and sighed, "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as comments about the Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with well-known co-producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to urge people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to treat Harmony's character," Brown said.
The only black character who's a hooker packed by a white pimp.
Producer Dear White People pushed finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the film's directing rights; Damon said their directing "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in discord with Damon's comment.
A Twitter user, MrPooni, expressed anger at writing the video, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet has received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon’s commentary comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the killing of a teenage Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national prominence and pushed lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince made allusions to the movement while presenting Album of the Year nominees at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement made a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love,” the group said in a statement.
Damon was recently reported on a list of entertainers, producers and moguls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss a depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met with the pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has its first winner"
Professional mountaineer and picker Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home $1 million.
In the competition, which has just finished its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb over a more than 220 m long rope.
Britten climbed first, within the limit, and became the first competitor to overcome the strenuous 4th stretch in American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero surpassed it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! News right after his hard-won victory, and it was clear that he was still in shock at winning the $1 million grand prize.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” Isaac E! said in response to his win.
"So all of a sudden... I can't imagine what it's going to be like."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the finale and why Britten won't receive any award despite the fact that he became the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to whoever finishes the track the fastest.
“If there are more than one competitor on the track, the winner will be the one with the best time,” Weed said.
Although winning a major win would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he has resentment in him.
He is glad that he has achieved what he has achieved.
He received a warm reception from his fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me, “If there was anyone who could beat me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I had won, Isaac would have felt the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue for an eighth season, which will begin shooting in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers just walked past the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the rose garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers narrowly averted their defeat by defeating Minnesota in Tuesday's match with a close score of 5-4 at Target Field.
The twins missed a chance to get close to the Houston Astros and grab the second wild card in the American League.
Even if only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the Z word that was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun and it doesn’t matter how,” Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
The Tigers' pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive advance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 kicks and 3 turns.
It was his third successful game in the last nine games.
"I want to finish this year with convincing results," Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a game when you’re sitting on a bench a lot and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tigers batterer Victor Martinez hit three times and made two rounds and his first draw point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point game since the last game in June, in which he hit four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned in," Ausmus said.
“He looked good in training, he scored noticeably better and he managed to get it into the game.”
With three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins had the best chance of getting back in the game.
Byron Buxton won the game with two points on the left side of the field.
Right-handed poleman Aaron Hicks scored a point with a set bat, and Simon struck out Brian Dozier before left-handed Blaine Hardy replaced him.
Hardy knocked out his only opponent, Mauer, and had batter Miguel San in front of him, who blew the ball and rounded two goals, leaving behind right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two goalkeepers and a chance to draw in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third goalkeeper over two goals.
Plouffe has already won 27 rounds over two finishes this season and reigns league table.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed man eliminated San for three overthrows.
Detroit took advantage and scored points with Phil Hughes.
The Tigers won three rounds in the first two shifts against a retired right-handed man who entered the game after more than a month's hiatus due to inflammation of the back muscles.
"I hadn't imagined such a start," Hughes said, "but by the third shift, I felt I could throw better."
After resisting the onslaught in the first shift, Hughes dropped one point to the other metre Ian Kinsler.
Two exits for the right pole J.D. Martinez took Victor Martinez, who was the first to pass all the finishes.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
Third-member Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the pitch and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was overturned when he tried to make it to third base.
The Tigers added in the second shift, when pitcher James McCann and pole player Anthony Gose scored two and then one point, and the resulting score was 3-0.
"That got us to our knees," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won by number of throws, finished in the third shift without points and was replaced by right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three goals, scored six shots and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right-handed Tigers pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez’s shoulder in 2007, will take care of him.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list due to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, is set to play in Wednesday's match.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return after injury to fight the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded for left-hander David Price, he has scored 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he has not played since August 20 due to stretched muscles.
Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will be challenged by Minnesota left-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said at the 16th meeting of the Central Leader Group on Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting opening-up in nascent reforms will give new impetus and vitality, and will also provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Leading Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the easing of border control policies, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital, and the reorganization of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and businesses that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
The move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, securing a legal business environment and making the market more open.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to firms and make sure that firms themselves decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up a state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card", thanks to the optimization of requirements and simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, new beds may be created.
According to the Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Pánik (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the current capacity of the in-patient departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of each hospital.
There are also opportunities to expand care.
For example, the department of surgical departments could create a one-day surgery center, where, according to the set concept, operations of surgical departments that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
In which specific hospitals the workplace focused on one-day surgery should be, it is not yet clear.
In turn, a laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases could be created at the skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital.
The concept also recommended the creation of an Apalic center that would take care of patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity that seems insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region are post-care beds, especially the beds of the Long-Term Sick Treatment Centre (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and above all should closely follow the beds of acute care.
Part of this facility should function as rehabilitation beds and part as classic LDN beds, the concept recommends.
As he points out, post-care beds are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There, abandoned buildings could be used after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary Region there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the republic, so it could also serve for other regions as the so-called Alzheimer's center.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which funds from European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will follow the branches of specialized care and will create space for the translation of patients after surgery, for example, after cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery," describes the regional concept of in-patient care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
