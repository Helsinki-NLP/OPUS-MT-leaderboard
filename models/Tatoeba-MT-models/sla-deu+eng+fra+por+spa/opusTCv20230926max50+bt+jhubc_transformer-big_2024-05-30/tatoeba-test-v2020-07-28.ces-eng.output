Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking of taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a high tip on the table.
There's nothing like a glass of beer after a day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
So far I am satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave it for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting, even though I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you were probably dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for it.
Tom's obviously lying.
Straight and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to call you back.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom will be thirteen the day after tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch him ruin his life.
Do everything with prudence.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We climbed to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
My belt's too tight.
Playing the bassoon is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer here.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are rapidly dying out.
Tom's still busy.
You'd better get going now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to bother you, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom shouting at the crowd?
He is the ideal husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in 17th-century costumes.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
He climbed the tree with great effort.
Translating the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom stood up, too.
We already know that, Tom.
I'm glad you brought this to my attention.
I skipped breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.
Hail is falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like that tie.
We didn't do as well as we'd hoped.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you and Joanna have a fight?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll be stuck here forever.
Tom took an enema.
What should I do in this situation?
Do you take the train to school?
Tom's not going to school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who will Tom visit?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary's.
Why don't you ask me out for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I cannot answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.
He's single.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was as happy as a flea when she got the record deal.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you'd helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He visits his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary could.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in such a place?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There are not enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom hasn't recovered.
I told Tom he was a fake friend, and he was offended.
I'm doing my laundry.
This bridge used to be a toll bridge.
He waved at her.
I was late for school this morning.
I took part in the search.
Sam went straight to bed.
We were shot on the lawn by the river.
Tom never drank hard alcohol.
Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm perfectly happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We must understand that we are still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary last night.
What's your dad's name?
There were half-demolished walls.
I spoke to him in English and found that I could talk to him.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence's fresh painted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you're gonna regret it.
You're fat.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and never came back.
Did you bring the book?
I dare not open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting a divorce.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
Who the hell are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, and I don't want anyone else reading it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we had a fit of laughter.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
It is better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you could do that for me.
Tom knows what he's going to say.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse growls.
I borrowed Tom's comb.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not that stick anymore.
You're not gonna believe what Tom just told me.
Mary has no one to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go hiking.
Try talking to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'll have a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
It used to be bigger.
I'm assuming he went home.
I was in the woods.
Tom got drunk.
He asked me to wait there until he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd better get back inside.
She doesn't have to do it.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
He has his own house.
I don't usually do that at night.
Why do you want me to ask them for help when we can handle it ourselves?
I expected them to tell the truth.
Sweep it under the mat.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's slim.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Throw the balloon to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved in this?"
We love kids.
I wish I was a better person.
Stealing, huh?
Tom's got to get his hair done.
You should consult a lawyer in advance.
You're a good journalist.
Tom is used to it.
I love this book.
The garbage is clogged again.
When I came home from work, I found out that someone had robbed our apartment.
Read the book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like silent movies.
This is working.
Stop whining.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still dissatisfied.
Could the message be true?
Easily acquired, easily lost.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
If it wasn't for her help, I'd never have passed the exam.
You wouldn't be any happier if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning on coming swimming with us.
Oh, my God, Tom, what the hell is this?

I don't know how old Tom is.
I'd like you to come with me.
I told Tom it wasn't over yet.

Tom went to his locker.
The first jump went bad.
Well, let's have lunch.
We should give him a present.
In England, a waiter asked us, "How much beer would you like, half a pint, or all of it?" Since we had no idea how much it would be, we asked him to show us the glasses.
