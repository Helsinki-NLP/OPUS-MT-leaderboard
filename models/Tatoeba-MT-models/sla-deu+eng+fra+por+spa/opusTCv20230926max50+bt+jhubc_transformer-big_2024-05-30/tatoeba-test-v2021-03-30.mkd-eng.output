It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised he'd help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That's gonna take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're cold.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the bike?
He is a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not taking advantage of Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary that he was happy.
We only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's fire them.
How much is it worth?
The water was up to our throats.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was looking at him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
He raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He probably still has it.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What's this? What's this?
No one knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've watched it before.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine, give it back to me.
The wolves were chasing the herd.
This song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll get there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever shot a gun before?
I really like that tattoo.
Get a ticket for free.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can guess.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they done so far?
Tom's childless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom did as Mary had told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for this job is high.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom realizes that he was not a good father, so he tries to make amends.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little blushing in his cheeks.
No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would deny it.
I have to help him.
He is being criticized.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit the gum.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
We don't descend from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you'd like to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big for me.
I'll do it, if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one is judging you.
Stop making Tom notorious.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes ham with eggs.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously an asshole.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Shall we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary rolled up the film.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary had hit John.
Tom wrote this report himself.
Do they buy like this?
He doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give that back to me?
That was personal.
I'd better go too.
Excuse me briefly.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please, don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at it.
We better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know that Tom and Mary had been married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're in luck.
My nose runs out every time I get a cold.
We've met a few times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you can understand.
Everyone is looking for happiness.
Has anyone else entered the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom treated me terribly in high school.
Tom wore a hat that still stood the price.
Tom promised he'd help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There's a difference to be made.
The ring is cursed.
We should call for help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient and even submissive.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
Don't be a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run! Run!
Is it paid for delivery?
I like raps.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy those for me?
You've never seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been postponing this too long.
I don't get it.
That's pathetic.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also accept checks.
A newspaper costs a dollar.
How did it get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonian has four verb modes: expressed, conditioned, commanded, and transmitted.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need a license.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember when I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom is now a martyr.
Tom looked furious.
What will the Japanese economy look like next year?
That's how I got in trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a child's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom dumped me.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must continue.
He made a scandal of standing well.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't draw attention.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite bat.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a trawler.
Who do you have on the list?
He's got a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you gave Mary flowers?
What's not to like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Make sure you don't get sucked into a muddy pond.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
The sauna is here.
It can't be her.
Today is the fateful day they will try to escape.
They've all gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's totally wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future starts today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good series.
Tom's already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got his room.
No survivors.
She should have kept her mouth shut.
I'm not like you!
“It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.” – “Then why are you still alive?”
They smiled quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I slapped him.
Tom is not alone.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than 100 people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was especially annoyed to give speeches, due to his severe speech defect.
She did not accept the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is defective.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
She licked it.
Who are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing the pills.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem too busy.
We'll get to it right away.
Didn't you hear me yelling?
Take a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Take out the clamp.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep the promise he made to me.
Didn't you want the prize?
Look at Dimon.
I'm glad you're glad.
Don't be honest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Buckle up.
Get him to confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory sucks.
We went bankrupt.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you just give me a little help?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to confront Tom directly.
My son's not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not a single height in his story.
The battle was short.
How retarded I am!
We've discussed this.
Tom's got the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
Electric heater heats the ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the canopies.
Let's forget it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he abandoned his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data fast.
You mustn't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first I couldn’t stand it.
His sleeve's stuck.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'm gonna stay here and help him.
Shut up!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone was gone except for him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's darkening.
The pipes are clogged.
I offended you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They squatted next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly investigated the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We have to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do it.
The water reached my knees.
Let's make a cake.
You need to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom drank a bottle of wine.
I fell off a wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Does it bother you?
When does the show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks ripped apart.
Tom persuaded Mary to donate money.
I've got him with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you fooled her.
I am not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom began to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling very well today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did he ask for money?
Get him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It is a multi-stage process.
I got a little present for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom is not shy at all.
Tom ran down the aisle.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Mustard's really hot.
We advertise our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I auditioned a few times, but I didn't get the job.
It happened almost 30 years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there anybody in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's about to leave.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They've blocked it.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What is that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you were hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You need to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would've figured it out.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom stretched out his arms.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says his previous dentist told him he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don’t expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's what Tom suggested.
It seems wrong to me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Curry powder is a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a rough night.
Tom drove around the city with the brakes raised without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you like camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on staying here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
Now you do, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be rolling over in his grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, not realizing that their own behavior is undesirable.
Wear high heels to make it taller.
Do you like bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
Yeah, I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
He owns a blue car.
Don't make any noise.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
And what does it matter?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
How stubborn you are.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made a decision.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used improper expressions.
Coffee gives you energy.
Tom was a nice guy.
A great Meraklia is for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
He writes well.
Something very similar has happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
She no longer felt safe in her own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to give up the idea.
Tom's really pissed.
Why did he leave so suddenly?
We all perceive her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes glowed with anger.
Why did you yell?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
You'll have to ask him about that.
He gave his word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
“I want to travel, too.”
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
I was the one he wanted to meet, Tom.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Maybe Tom's richer than we thought.
I never meant to deceive you.
What the hell was that all about?
I have no such desire.
I called a couple of people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your strain.
He apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking is suicide.
Butterflies and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom shaved his knee.
Where did the pines come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It is made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom stood up, and the crowd applauded.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he failed.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink soft drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He is also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize a guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her in.
You're cooking turkey with light bulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so let it be.
Dan was a very caring dad.
Are you a vegetarian?
She took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I quit smoking cut off.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn’t seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm already feeling much better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want to be seen.
It's a pity the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My dad used to bring me here when I was young.
You're such a jerk.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept quiet.
I'm hardened.
Tom arrived early.
He dried his wet clothes by the fire.
He always speaks his own English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
None of the pigs were lost.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What's gonna happen next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The car has four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom packed his bags.
What's the use of that?
That's very helpful.
Tom's phone was vibrating.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl walked slowly.
It turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time. You can form opinions without needing facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I couldn’t read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open it with a jar.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't help it.
Tom is still annoyed.
Do people really hate each other?
I didn't hear that.
She laughed at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
It's not a big priority.
Here, take this.
What time is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn’t help her.
Tom always got what he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your red eyes.
I was ready for war.
Tom crawled on the ice.
I'll never surrender.
I hope you're ready for the challenge.
Tom likes the idea.
It's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom looks cheerful.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda had nausea and suspected she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting started more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know how to do.
I've got money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, fix yourself.
Tom tossed the arrow.
Don't crow.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a prodigal dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't say anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is an emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
The beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
You should bring them here right now.
He lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you have helped us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
She greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I haven’t solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom moved his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's in big trouble.
It's not blue. It's purple.
Who was he with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs are usually killed before the age of one, so they are eaten by humans.
Could you get that arrow out of my leg?
I forgot how smart you can be.
Can I see that one?
He's wasting his money on water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't think.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on, man.
This book weighs.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom keeps lying to me.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously very bad at muffling sounds. I hear him chewing gum in the next room!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the lock.
Look at us.

That did the job.

Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He was standing in front of her.
There's more than one way out.
Tom's always been very protective of his kids.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen handkerchiefs.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I haven’t had time to write that report yet.
I can do without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
He's getting dressed.
She threatens Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I love to walk by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a bit expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get off.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to dive?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'm gonna use the dream.
How about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the compositions.
It was an awful sight.
Dan's knife was covered in blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
This afternoon we're going to eat cherries from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a fierce bull.
I'll take Tom home.

I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsociable.
Tonight's good for me.
They're headed east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The ceramids that fell from the roof fell apart.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have thrown us out.
Tom's not ashamed.
I'm just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.

Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary screaming.
I couldn’t believe this was really happening to me.
The amoebas are lifeless.
If you do that to me, I'll slit your throat.
Is he dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
That doesn't necessarily mean Tom's dead.
The waves are created by the wind.
Get a clean glass out of the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left her a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way the French write their word for "beautiful".
The crane can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're gorgeous.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that what you're good at?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into cubes and fried.
Ask an expert.
I love traveling.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.

Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of kind.
Tom wiped his forehead.
This book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You have a conscience, don't you?

I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a handkerchief, you're running your nose.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely goes out.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Camille should have stayed.
She has ten children.

Get some food.
It may be difficult.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought you might be able to help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us work too hard.
Slow down.

Who needs to ask questions?
Mary was proud of her league.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.

That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.

It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.

The question is who will do it.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everyone happy?

Forget it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.

Please, ask me anything.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.

Now the question is what we should do.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He finished fourth out of 56 runners.

Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom did not respond immediately.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened attentively so that we would not miss a word.

Why are you so anxious tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?

You have lovely eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, it'll fix itself... when the willow bears grapes.
Tom is an adviser.
Can I talk to you for a second?

Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when it's your birthday.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Good luck to me!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I won't move.
Hold on a second.
I've got a lot to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I have no comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's enough air in here.
Married to zero by a man.
The wind stopped.
Nothing's changed.

Can someone help me?
We're going this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.

Did you google it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
Mystery solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.

Well, here's the explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm doing.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
He who can hear butterflies laughing knows the taste of clouds.
We were playing golf.
This is my grandma.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They drew lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to eat like commodities!
But if I were in Brazil, I would be much more afraid.

I think it's time for you to leave now.

Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to go down.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's awful.

You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
My mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.

You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funerals.
We're probably wrong.

If you're interested, let me know and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he couldn't do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's what I'm good at.
Does it hurt so much?
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who runs this place?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get colder.
What are you drinking?
How it came - so it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
Everything stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.

I've been sick for two days.
It's too easy to bend.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.

Take these.
We're expecting her.
The rain does not come in handy.
I'll tell them to leave now.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got an assassin.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was shooting Mary with a rotten egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.

I can deal with her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was worried right away.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already do.
She wrote a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to swim across the river.

We barely escaped.
Did they hire you?
There's a gas leak.
Tom could see that Mary was texting.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii, you can cruise all year round.
Tom was motivated.
You might have to help us.
Most people believe that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Dude, you can't just go up to a woman and scratch her -- that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her that I loved her.
Find your supernatural power.
I'll go first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sedated.
You can't do anything you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was blowing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That doesn't happen here.
It is better to be optimistic and deceived than to be pessimistic and right.
The water was lukewarm.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
The boy was silent.
The hull of the ship is divided into several watertight parts.
Given what you've been cooking, I'm gonna do the dishes.
Let's leave it at that.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your stamina.
He's got false eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one cookie left.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knocking?
I'm not waiting for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's not the shy boy he used to be.
You understand?
Don't make a scene now.
What was said to Tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We've got a lot to do.
Tom was never evil.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
Everywhere there were boys divided into groups. Some played jams, some tile, some with a ball. Others rode a bike or rode wooden horses.
Doubt destroys a friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was covered in snow.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We should both go.
The pain that causes love is sweeter than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He hit his head.
We're in.
Put the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom is furious.
I can't find the equation.
Listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm pissed.
It's less wet today than it was yesterday.
It’s hard to make new friends.
It's strange how people in the tropics eat spicy foods like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't tell who wants the baby because it's pointing at both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
He's rich, but he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom had a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't like to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry tree in the garden.
Jim has never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom was fighting.
I said it might swell.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Can you fix the toilet?
Go away. Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're handy?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt has a slit on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What is your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing just fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Come on in.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We've all noticed that.
You have a lot of beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail someday.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
The milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you object?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why does no one want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'm gonna ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn’t know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we'll need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much does it cost over there?
God forbid!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
In which country is Boston located?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I was just crawling in my room, waiting for me to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is very happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You just heard.
Tom has a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one here.
That is not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did his best.
He's a greedy man.
First, let's talk about what Tom has to do.
Mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that risk.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a babysitter.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you told them you were going to give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, men and women are completely different.
I go fishing every week.
What did you decide?
Is that necessary?
Tom is behind.
I'll never like you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well dried up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
You might want to call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German donuts.
Then we were eighteen years old.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I love broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran away.
Keep up the good work.
This is disgusting.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
Is Tom hurt?
You got drunk.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should pick her.
Keep it up.
You're gorgeous.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
She looked at Mary harshly.
Tom was wearing a sweater.
Tom looks resolute.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who started the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
I've been much worse.
Tom tried to stay calm.
I use that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I just had a glass.
No one writes to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mom told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone was in control.
Every customer has their own rights.
I'm just calling to hear from you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they looked at me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We've won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
I'm going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
He's oppressing us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn’t look like his father.
Tom's not really hardened.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed your shampoo?
Tom was looking around, expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's warm in here, you can take your coat off.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is a pessimist.
You are entitled to a phone call.
Skiing was much more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We cannot forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get that guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I don't want to get involved.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the forms.
I don't imagine a party like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would like to come with us?
Yoga originated in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom smeared his toast with butter.
We have work to do.
I heard him sniffing.
Shall we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there, on the ridge.
I'll take anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the children alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It will soon be Christmas.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect wording of the question.
Tom seemed accustomed to such problems.
You're gonna be okay.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's stiff.
Let's sing and dance.
After a war, the winners are always right, and the losers are always guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translating jokes is quite difficult, if at all can be said to be possible.
It's been an arena day.
I have bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome the weakness.
How many push-ups do you do a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
You wouldn't happen to have a key, would you?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his body was full of alcohol.
Tom's getting fat.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little attitude.
I'll make sure we finish the projects on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't make me come for you, Tom.
He won first place in the competition.
I just want you back to me.
Dan was smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed up late last night.
You're depraved.
Everyone was silent.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad, what's wrong?
You've given up on the plan.
It's not just guesswork.
How do we find them?
It may seem strange.
No one can be saved from death.
It won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy promotes freedom of speech.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that how long it takes?
He was devastated by health problems.
You know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
He has a pain in the ear.
Dan was hit on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What did Tom do?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not a good time.
You're out of liquor.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get a reply from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
This song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's he got in mind, Tom?
A mother's advice would outweigh a friend's.
We have not yet escaped the danger.
Tom's freaking out.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him over there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday is the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom immediately.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I've done it.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom's seen worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to make pasta.
The hunter went deep into the woods and never came back.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay what I have to.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom's a nice guy.
Stop yelling, I'm getting a headache.
You ain't got me in charge, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't get fed up.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm gonna get stronger.
This elephant is loved by young children.
Thank you so much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary puts on her lipstick.
She has a picture.
He swims well.
The flowers are fading.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is very annoying.
We need more American Tatoeba slang, urgently!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom'll get scared and quit.
Is this place vacant?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want tea.
Under no circumstances would I want to get in the way.
Doesn't anyone want to sit with you?
It would be really nice if you didn't say anything.
Tom said Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a traveler.
I'm flying out of school.
I often heard him play the melody of the trumpet.
Unsatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom's a fool.
I think Tom's gonna be here on time.
Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complex.
Check to see if the gas is off.
Would you participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the noodles.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a couple of books together.
Why are you so angry?
I prefer coffee to tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy human companionship.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you get a message to Tom?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, accidentally.
Did you talk, Tom?
It’s hard to understand self-harm if you’ve never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's evening.
The pressure is rising.
Tom answered Mary’s question immediately.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can myrrh be used in food?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom began to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom is the leader.
Save it, Tom.
You haven't solved your problems, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
Nobody's gonna find me.
Tom was very angry.
In what situations would you use it?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you're going to have to do this without help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't love him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Get Tom's gun.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you do any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
I'm very cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours without interruption.
I got quality.
Have you found someone to look after the child?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom nodded aloud.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not gonna say anything.
That'd be good.
It is quick to walk.
Tom's very stingy.
That's all I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan got Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's already eleven o'clock.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what gift Tom has prepared for me.
I've seen it myself.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems annoyed.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no substitute.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where there are none.
My sister does her hair to the hairdresser two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
The water from the rain evaporates when it is warm.
Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
Looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must still be in school.
I never say anything, even if it annoys me.
You're below his level.
I'm sorry to be early.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible Tom could hire Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom's very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, ventilate the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to accept the job.
How much of our body is water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please, help me meet Tom.
You're so smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Do not stay longer than five minutes.
As time went on, the radioactivity decreased.
Should we believe that?
Why are you dressed up like that?
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was caught in a trap.
I'll call them.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're a faggot.
What are you up to?
Why are you being mean to me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one did anything else.
I'm sorry to intrude like this.
The books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a nice statement.
They must be worried.
I drove him.
That gave me an idea.
The fed clock broke.
I've been asking about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Come on, everybody, follow me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to watch the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a gun.
Tom closed the door.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's go sledding.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me feel better.
I hear they're paying pretty good.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you get anything to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Hey, look at me.
How many liters of oil does it store in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There may be another light.
We don't have anything you want.
The bulb is green.
Tom repented of what he had said to Mary.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom muttered.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom, you combed your hair.
They all sat down.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like to walk.
She seems a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're about to start.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So, I'm serious.
It's forbidden to talk during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary doing it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give a signal?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write a thank-you letter to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Let's go!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he likes to have breakfast in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp over.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's very close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited – everyone gets their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This fabric stretches a lot when it's washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Have you heard of him?
Tom started talking.
I ran away from class.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, I'm gonna have a hard time catching fish.
Tom was napping.
I think she's good at dancing.
The system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibition.
Tom needs the two of us.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom looks confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom said he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep as a abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
Everybody's got drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He is a tough critic.
I had a cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you didn't forget something?
We played basketball at the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I've got a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll make the call.
There's no way to get to Tom's house this way.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom shrugged.
Please say it again.
You're so dramatic.
Tom licked it.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
It is said that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's cool.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
But it's cool!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much to do.
Could that be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was elected Mayor of Boston.
Police found footprints at the crime scene.
I asked the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom kept the letter.
Tom would have liked that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's all yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's the spinner.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this on my own.
They probed the spaceship.
He wrote me more than 30 letters.
Are you sure this isn't made of diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
Dream that you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is unpredictable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was barefoot.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I slashed the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's feet were cold.
Boys and girls are reading.

Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were being chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew that Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging your wells.
I've got a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you anyway.
You're a good cook.
There's no shortcut to the top, only to the abyss.
Tom's pretty weak.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's getting paid a lot.
It was sad.
You clearly cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automated vehicles are now available.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom wears chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I hit Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The organist was an older man.
I was playing tennis.
I think you can help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm making scrambled eggs.
I love the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take a bribe.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed rabbit.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the bagpipe?
They picked her up nicely.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three kids.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn’t really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a duty to me to spend the evening with a smart, witty and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl escaped from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a waste.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd text me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
She undressed to take a bath.
A river of sweat began to pour down on my face.
Mary renounced moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just forget it.
We're learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How were you hanging out?
Movies are a great pastime.
At first I didn’t see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning to leave.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged it.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone was smiling.
I didn't ask your opinion.
The flight was cancelled due to bad weather.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
He sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they'll come back.
It's thundering out there.
The whole board is against it.
The world is illuminated by the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made himself a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Stay away from bad people.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut off my finger.
What did I do with that pamphlet?
It didn't get that bad.
The plug's not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to keep an eye on Mary.
Mary likes hot coffee and Tom likes milk.
I gave her a false address.
I'm out.
I'm not angry anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think about Tom.
They started firing.
Tom nodded.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
Why do I need a lawyer?
The nuns are singing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where's Tom buying?
He looked awful.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Take your clothes off.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me now.
Let me help you.
Tom's got anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new person.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm getting a cold.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls shorter than you.
I have to tighten my belt.
Tom almost bumped into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This isn't a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I’m getting weaker.
Tortilla looks nice.
Has anyone broken your heart?
I feel the same way.
What made you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd you go, Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please be on time.
The Germans have a weaker attitude towards nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan went to the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large tomb.
Women love men with moustaches.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both shouted.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I could get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I was unlucky.
His body was overgrown with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I really pissed off Tom.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The people on the island are very friendly.
Let's try it with Tom first.
I've always preferred mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I like to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the cap?
Tom is one of the most prominent American songwriters.
It can't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom Covey will never come back here again.
No one likes to cry.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb a distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's really freaking out.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We arrived first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary a lot.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You learn fast.
We ate a lot of good food.
He has been unemployed for three months.
Tom doesn't have much to offer.
I got beat up.
No one will bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought some smelly garbage bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely goes out.
He contracted malaria while traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom had hidden the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport's expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
You have a good memory.
Can he do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We're bringing them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was going to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is not yet fully aware of what has happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
You seem to already know the answer.
Would you mind taking us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
He was very helpful to us.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'll come and save you.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We're screwed.
Who made the doll?
I didn’t lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was brownish brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come into my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I got some donuts.
I'm learning French.
Don't look at you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls won't be playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's ingenuity.
We have to call Tom.
They're going to hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is made up mostly of poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the Differences.
That's awful.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women love men with moustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People are dying all the time.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He took out his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom was reluctant to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked the mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that topic with you.
Did you ask for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and politely bowed down.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Mark thinks he writes well.
Tom looked up.
My ears are buzzing.
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such an asshole!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complexed.
Tom didn't want to succumb.
Tom's been suspended.
They hooked up.
She's going to be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was awful.
Tom looks shattered.
Something's odd.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That’s all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we can find some help in the nearest village.
We hope he's all right.
You're capable, but you're screwing up.
He's been working at the embassy since three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this yourself.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's pissed.
It's work.
We'll figure it out.
Praise encourages students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about 30 years old.
What's going on?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom weighed himself.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for noblewomen.
He has been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How to choose just one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the bloody bed, with a dagger deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They pay me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
Couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be so proud.
You used to be so funny.
Would you mind staying for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're special.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I can hear your child's laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are forging something.
Just leave us at war.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins arguments.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder thundering?
Do not confuse work and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy at work.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
He got up from the couch.
Don't piss off Tom.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked for Mary’s help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's corpse in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely true.
The rats are small.
Please, stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he looked at him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was in the back seat.
The bank lent $1 million to the company.
I have a lot more to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what is important to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always interrupts me when I'm talking.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I drank too much last night, my head's on fire, I'm hungover.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't remember the guy's name.
I'm gonna get your baby.
That was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I am interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom moved cautiously.
Just go inside.
He wanted a sword out of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I've done my part.
You're ridiculous.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut off his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom is an only child.
The woman calls the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
There were many more of them than of us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's furious.
I don't even know what's what.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
He cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my arm.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I had a blood vessel in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
You overreacted!
There's a son who's missing.
I'm trying to work.
What's your taste?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show is going to be cancelled; they haven't sold a lot of tickets.
Tom's coming.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use deodorant.
Does Tom swim a lot?
The girl fell asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don’t force your child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughable.
Tom paid me.
I like to read books.
He was executed.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom looks like a jerk.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was so warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their flaws.
Tom was behind the wheel.
What are we doing with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I feel like it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one less suitcase than I did, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're awful.
Where does he live anyway? In some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary is an expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in the orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd water the garden.
Do you have any idea how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please do not add comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you wore when I met you?
Lightning usually accompanies thunderbolts.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I have a little fever.
Tom slammed him to the ground.
The lecture has no end!
The glasses are in the cup cupboard.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to hook up with him.
Excuse me for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
How come you're still awake?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
He didn’t have the courage to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the garbage.
We've both seen him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I made a nice statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this wonderful?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
In fact, I'm dating my ex-boyfriend again.
Just do this job.
I think Tom is wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom says he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
- Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
Her hair and the way she holds her head remind me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes got soaked.
Tom would return.
She always works hard.
Which country are you a citizen of?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting with Tom.
I prefer dogs to cats.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
He still can’t swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
You can't stand the heat.
Looks like these two have settled down.
Unfortunately, I can't allow that.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You are part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean it that way.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep up the good work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
Now I'm looking for them.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn’t understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I am still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree is floating.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost doing everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary yelling at John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits for long.
Go with the crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa have died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
The forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know how to sympathize.
There's a little more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The noise annoyed me.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I can see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop star.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is Tom like that?
I have sinus problems.
I had very low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She handles the saw very well.
Turn it off.
I don’t share my real name on any website.
You forgot the plan.
I don't want to lie.
“Time is not money, time is life.”
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is so beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week or so.
He is slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a spinster.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get to Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was smeared with sperm.
Tom is fair.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
I don't want to do anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Oh, thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
It's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm so confused.
They waited outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so he was ordered out of the firm.
I'd understand anything from you.
Tom wants to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom has to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
It's overpriced.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would have enjoyed this.
Tom went upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, but I don't know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what has just begun.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.

We made trees.
This is so much better.
I'll make her mow your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom withdrew his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You need to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You're baking bread in your oven.
You're embarrassing.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and steak.
You must forgive me.
She went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They raided the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't dispute that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for it.
It still doesn't work.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he honest?
The bowl was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give in.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire came back to life in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'm gonna call someone.
Where should these documents be sent?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is in jeopardy.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates to run.
I couldn't get back to you.
- Is it true?
I know you're mad.
When I came by this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is blurred.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
I don’t have enough money at the moment.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
Lightning struck the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never step in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has a job to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in the horoscope?
I know how to go.
I'm contributing.
It was a disaster!
Tom is good at his job.
I figured it out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom set this up.
I won't betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water is lukewarm.
There was no plant life in this area.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I had to do.
Tom's too far away.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, so?
I am very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not trained to do that.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and the poet travel together.
No time for explanations.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, it breaks all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom wasn't playing fair.
The wound was draining pus.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you for a second?
Tom couldn't help it.
He covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you ask for on the internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom dumped Mary's papers on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm studying art history.
I don't quite agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like these two are back together.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom doesn't speak French very well yet.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're aliens.
It is the translator’s moral choice whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left to the language that produced them.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to get Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems anxious.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom’s kindness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun varies steadily.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deeply in the eye and smiled.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all good.
The stars are shining.
Oh, really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You should have found them.
I couldn't get enough sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You will be informed in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was very kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're a skater.
We're going shopping.
Tom knew that Mary would like John.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
I have a headache.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does he have to go, Tom?
Would I lie to you?
It has a passive character.
It's possible someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a powder medicine.
We were walking down the coast.
I don't want you to harass them.
It depends on your decision.
That's feasible.
Tom reacted badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was looking at you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're so cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure for her to meet her great-granddaughter.
It's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom squinted.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started injecting.
It's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak in your own name.
It has resulted in great difficulty.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're qualified for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help it.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's jammed.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so conscience really makes us all cowards.
No need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You were wrong.
It's good to see you.
You're free to go now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom went to Boston.
The screen emits a green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened quickly.
What evidence?
When I woke up this morning, I had terrible news.
The knee wound is now puss.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything.
Tom is an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying it.
Maybe Tom can hear you.
How long has Tom been asleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a candy with menthol?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll come down here.
We're paranoid.
It's not silver.
A blood vessel burst into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy man to get along with.
I don't want pork.
She likes to run.
I need a nutmeg.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom rereads the note.
The children drew pictures on the pavement with chalk.
You're wondering why you took so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I should take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I've been to Boston twice.
He married at the age of 26.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up at the airport?
We play with the computer.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening to something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom often seems to have no idea what’s going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this all about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to boast of the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What's on your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what had happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
She swims well.
You won't find us.
I've heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
Actually, it's a lot.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do anything to make you mad at me, Tom?
Triangles do not have four angles.
There is not enough light to read.
Tom's done the math with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary opened the lipstick.
Guess what.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom's been asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
The moon is returning.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's dawn.
Mr. Gorbachev, knock down the walls!
Tom looks overwhelmed.
Tom was stunned.
This is how it should be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I'm not comfortable with retirement.
Thanks for asking.
There's a good reason I don't like Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into that right now.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are empty.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent.
The girl who wears the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What the fuck?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
Who were your teachers?
We had meetings.
Tom'll be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control it.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I did not get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school by car.
Did you watch?
I'm gonna have to think this through.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Are you writing the proverbs?
It was a great series.
We should go find them.
The last time I was home was on a Friday night when I was 13 years old.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think's gonna change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just a pain in the ass.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night, trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's pissed anyway.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's keep our peace!
Tom's well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm unarmed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Tom arrived on time.
Television is annoying.
Oh, lovely!
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please, look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say goodbye to them.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds quite valid.
It's awesome!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please, write that down.
Tom arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on a bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of sparks flying from the hearth.
It's just fiction.
She was quiet all night with Mary.
He wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get a soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the upcoming exam.
We're on our way to Boston.
Tom's a good dad.
You stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three buckets of bug spray.
It was filthy.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these medications for my dad.
Kids love cakes.
He was very restrained.
I can handle it with Tom.
Tom gets angry.
This is from us.
In case of an emergency, what number should I call?
I still love a horse.
I didn't even touch it.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary took all Tom's money.
Enough with the bullshit.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
He always wanted a son.
Tom's got a big mouth.
It's like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom began to groan.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We would like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom left work early.
We have EVERYTHING.
I baked his cookies.
When does the school year end?
You were right from the beginning.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They ignore me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
His girlfriend's weakened.
It's over between me and Tom.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
He left me in despair.
She woke up from a nightmare.
Tom's visually impaired.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't take pictures in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
- Is it done?
We all want lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where are you going with Tom?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom opened his eyes.
The tribe was not happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open it.
Put on an apron.
You could be wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It's been an honor.
I talked to my advisors about which items to pick up.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There is no one in the classroom.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room below this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it, so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure of anything.
What do you think of her?
What is the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in his ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like that before.
You're so impertinent.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Daddy really too slow today, or is it me?
Did you ask me on Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back on his feet.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back until dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite type of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was astounding.
I can't see anything.
He's a pretty nasty man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom is jealous of me.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one on the spot.
Stop! Stop!
You want some cheese?
I'll get her for you.
He gets tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are not clean at all.
That was very careless on the part of Tom.
It's broken.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got angry.
Let them cut your hair.
Cutting is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They will pay them well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom glanced inside.
You are at the same time heavy and light, pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with or without you.
For now, let's say you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
It is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I knew.
Tom's an invertebrate.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget him.
We have to find them first.
I'm keeping score.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always confuse those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fusherly written.
You're supposed to be helping them.
Tom didn't even cry.
She wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the doorknob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
There is nothing worse than stupidity and indifference.
They're all being bullshit.
Tom didn't protest.
What are websites made of?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She is a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
How far is Boston?
They pay me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could get that ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on a train while he was going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the corkscrew out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't make me wait!
Tom gave me the picture hanging on the chimney.
Pigeons symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do anything for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enya's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
It's over now.
I'm falling asleep.
It is not scientifically proven that there is a connection between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
He's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom is brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a freezer.
I pressed a button to turn on the radio.
We play on the computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We looked everywhere for them.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
Press the button.
He really knows how to fight.
What is really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke up his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards lay eggs.
We'll do something about it.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad, do you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are going.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom going?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, come out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom loves adventure.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees fell.
Lions do not distinguish colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're too far from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you marrying Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
Let me quote a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that his wallet was missing.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why Do Cows Survive?
I have pus from my right ear.
Cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They cursed us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary, thanking her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Turtles live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom sleeps very well.
Are you helping him?
She looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here in a car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You're a little weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs from the sublime.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for madmen.
Why would I help him?
Tom lighted his shoes.
We have lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
I was born in Boston.
And how is that my fault?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom loaned me some money.
Am I bothering you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Look how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
Hang on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They'd really like that.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Get down, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm chasing.
He drove fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom'll at least apologize.
He's sucking on the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in his mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
No one is talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wiped his face.
What good do you do me?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when she wears those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor below this one.
They trusted her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't push the button.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammal.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's making fun of you.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to.
That narrows the choice.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to babysit for him.
I underlined the word "Alice" to highlight it.
Third luck.
We should go.
This airy dough is popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
Let us strive for the virtues and give up the vices.
You're smart.
I am against projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
She listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I arrived too late.
I could tell that Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are reports to write.
It hurts here.
You're upsetting Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish it tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Illnesses often occur at the most inopportune times.
The dog stared at me as if he wanted to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and they weren't real people at all.
The man is starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
All things are fleeting, but the good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did you think, Tom?
That was really nice.
Everyone dies at some point.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I think about it all day.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, folks!
This building is a monstrous building.
Tom was not disappointed.
Can you write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it so much!
Is this true in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed her a towel.
She has ears like a sail.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll be waiting for Tom.
I assume you read my report.
Tom withdrew.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherries are wormy.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look so good.
You wrecked Tom.
Warm it up.
He looked like he was complaining.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be physically and mentally stronger.
She is a cheerful girl.
If I could stay, I would.
Please, stop.
There is no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded annoyed.
They began to walk.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Don't memorize it.
"I got an A on my chemistry test. How about you?" "Same thing."
He was lucky to survive the attack.
Tom didn’t seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was a figurehead.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
It's right for me.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm taking Tom for a walk.
I don't feel good when I'm alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
Headlines should attract the attention of readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I watched a French movie with an English translation.
She laughed at Mary.
He is full of self-confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says my child's illnesses are fake.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing for us at the wedding.
Which one would you choose, Tom?
The hospital there is not very big.
Most people have to work to survive.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We're staying.
I don't caress their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I don't want and can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty at the age of ten to eleven years, and boys at the age of eleven to twelve years.
She's on her way.
Tell Tom he can't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will be clear soon.
The wall is cold to the touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I can't tell you yet.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was dressed up.
It was really cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I have a big sailboat.
Why can't you come?
The people rebelled against the king.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day of school.
Don't sneak around when you get home.
Tom taught me how to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That gun's not a toy, boy!
Half the species are getting married.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
That's Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't gossip about me.
I want to do social work to make up for everything I’ve done.
Tom tied his laces.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don’t understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom is wonderful.
This sentence can be interpreted in a number of different ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the wasps poisoning you?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're wrong, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary provided a lot of support.
Tom's in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who will pay the rent?
You're being a little rude.
Hey, put that back in its place.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I was waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows the etiquette.
You've seen what I can do.
We've got a lot of money.
Does your appearance fit your age?
Can I have it?
It’s not all milk and honey in Canada.
I have information on this topic.
Tom grinned.
Do you know the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I had prepared a speech.
Falcons have sharp eyes.
I wrote it to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom blew his trumpet.
We want a new carpet.
Sharing a taxi.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom laughed politely.
The teapot is very dirty.
You need a good night's sleep.
Tom took the weight off.
They went for a walk.
This is Grandpa from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano is active again.
Tom told me he had some things to take care of.
How will that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by strangling her.
A small island from afar looks like a turtle.
Do they bite trout?
What did you ask Tom?
Stop blanketing yourself.
I'm 30 years old.
His performance is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait.
You don't have much time.
The dog was barking.
Let's go see a movie.
Pretty women age better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He stumbled on it.
Mary felt her face warming up.
I know what upsets Tom so much.
I thought Tom was retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom unnecessarily raises his head.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
I'm in terrible pain here.
I hate the carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job's done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom is a gentleman.
Do you have any pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be nicer to each other.
Tom's interchangeable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everybody's screwing with him.
Faith means to hope for what reason cannot hope for.
Tom was my friend.
Tom wondered why Mary wouldn’t help him.
You're ruining your whole life.
I couldn’t imagine a world without music.
I live close by.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
Both books are of equal value.
We rented a movie.
The spruce is back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick your weapon.
They elected a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "Okay, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's sliding in the back.
We value our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked for a raise.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't already eaten, I'd really like to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He would have said something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he would never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons on the ground.
Can I see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
It's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do it.
It looks like it's greased.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The ventilator is not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Understood?
My day was full of activities.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father has the flu.
I don't wait long.
Just look at you.
This is magnificent.
Lacks empty in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
The soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand it.
The store is closed.
They listened.
Tom went out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom is furious.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They dismantled it.
Tom's a big dick.
Can I put this in here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I asked about them.
I'm sleepy.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
They roared like eels.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting at his desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
I don't see any conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take the mask off.
That's one option anyway.
You can go anywhere.
I'm embarrassed.
I liked the way you danced.
I need some of you.
We were deceived.
Tom is the right one.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've mutilated him.
It's a squirrel.
Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me out tomorrow afternoon.
Tom became violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We won't let you die.
The shoes are bugging me.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home after the rain.
I feel good when I'm alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but no friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I'm out of breath.
Can you catch those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I screwed up.
Scratch me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in the city.
Let's go wake up Tom.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice melted.
I spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
You must be very relieved.
I was never caught.
I love my homeland.
I didn't learn to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't spell me out.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is poor.
They look in the mirror.
It's not my nature to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom followed Marie to the door.
It looks very tasty.
I need to figure it out.
You two are inhaling against me!
I've never worn a sleeping bag in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried it all.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't bother us.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers were wearing steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed that Mary had caught a fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It's probably not worth the wait.
I have to buy a new queue for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
It's sunny today, but it's also cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My biggest ambition is to be an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom runs downstairs.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary got off on the first day.
Let's hang out.
The girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom did this.
"Aren't you going to eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took the weight off.
You're driving me nuts.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of genuine leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom sang.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather belt on her waist.
They were putting out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I'll go look for them.
Tom came even though it was raining.
I don't like to use dildos - I prefer real dicks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom made a speech.
We play on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom kicked my ass.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything?
Don't fight.
I'm expecting help from you.
Tom's going alone.
Tom only had A's at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are pure.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
You were great.
I wish I could tell people my real name.
The dentist installed a temporary seal.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They were contacted by local politicians.
Tom's taking notes.
They gave me this card.
We're going to have a discussion about the prognosis.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat the apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a $10 a week allowance.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom can speak French.
Tom cut my hair.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you spill wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with an elbow, right?
Men have about seven to eight times as much testosterone as women.
What kind of games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come over and help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting cold.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me, man.
I'm looking for you.
Do you like robots?
They're losing their minds.
He really sets me on fire.
I can go wherever I want.
He was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear is on its own.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I love her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
He always got what he wanted.
That's what I suspected.
Tom's not doing what he's supposed to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What did you make for dinner?
What did you do then?
Be careful with Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
He doesn’t want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
He looked in the other direction.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little bit?
I'll swish first.
Tom is now 30 years old.
I did not ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a chukunba just a few days before she turned ninety-nine years old.
Did you look everywhere?
It’s important to remember that no one is ever 100%.
He gesticulates as he speaks.
Sit next to me.
Tom is thrilled.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life in prison in 1633. However, due to his age and fragile health, he was allowed to serve that sentence under house arrest.
Scientists say that people who laugh more often live longer than those who are run over by a truck.
I talk to her often.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom cut the tree.
The land is still watered, the sword will probably be abandoned.
I was taking a nap.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever sucked a dick?
The dog was following me.
Those were Tom’s last words.
I think Tom's gone.
She wants to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's ridiculous.
Tom's very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's blushing a little.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood and remained silent.
I collect postage stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
You live here?
The room looks like a mess.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom's the fusher stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go away and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
Peaches are mild.
It doesn't matter.
I like comics.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind continued to blow.
In the meantime, the foolish uncle was sitting in the living room.
Was I talking to you?
Legumes fall from the tree.
Do you have a band?
You're welcome to wait here.
I got an A in French.
I want the class to be quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind blows.
It's a risky plan.
What's the fastest way to get from here to the post office?
I don't want Tom involved in this.
It's not a big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you should know this.
Are you going to disguise yourself this year?
I'll do what you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door snapped.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
She's lying at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
She saw how Mary looked at him.
You're pushing me a lot.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky cleared.
The noise will wake the baby.
Keep your eyes straight.
That's not exactly something a man should be preparing for.
Tom and Mary are playing a draw.
I made the decision.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think he'd rather be blue.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't touch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary to her.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's on his way.
The long walk gave him an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding has to be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like how your hair looks.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom is in danger.
He is addicted to pornography.
It's just silly.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is a mess.
Tom is the tallest man in the class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
It was our only consolation.
No one would care.
Did you write in a diary today?
I just want this never to happen again.
Can I do it myself?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to peer through the lock, but he couldn’t see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you crooked?
Come on, Tom.
I'll make sure I get there on time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're pretty much ready.
Tom has a keen ear.
I bought them.
I told you I can't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
He's not comfortable with me.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull the plug.
I helped him set the table.
I ate steak with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to take the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We sedated them.
Your faith sucks.
I'm sorry I told them anything at all.
I wouldn't ask you if I could find someone else.
Gather me in two and a half.
Tom drank.
I slept in the boat.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That might work.
Aren't you cold in short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He has an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom's seldom late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked cakes for them.
The fingerprints on the knife prove her guilt.
Can I wait for them here?
We can look it up in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I baked you cookies.
It can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded to Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun if we went to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
He hit me on the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems overwhelmed.
You're having fun prolonging your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
The meat smells bad.
Do I need to know you?
Tom has cleverly covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't give a damn.
She runs slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just yelled at Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was taller.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He got there before them.
Here, brother, halfway.
Tom sent the new flies he had just bought to the table.
Tom is going to help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's pissed.
The landscape is excellent.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to contain myself.
Autumn has arrived.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the car crash?
The water only takes three minutes to boil.
I could get fired for this.
What's the intent?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so glorious.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to enroll in a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat each other in the spirit of universal human belonging.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a lightning rod.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom likes to do everything on his own.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup's too salted.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom is still practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean yes or no?
Tom peeked into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend, can't you see how miserable I am?
Seems familiar to me.
I envy her.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all the noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're an astute man.
Everything seemed fine.
Put this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My husband and I shared a room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered, even.
Exercising.
She may have deceived you, but I'm not here either!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick of it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a cabbage.
It is easy to solve this task.
They have to remove the bullet that stuck to his spine.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom look upset?
This weekend, if you will.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how much it hurts to be stabbed by a catfish.
We import grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
Ice wipers do not help against ice.
I was pretty.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I don't think it's a good idea to ask Tom.
My brother's arriving tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are potatoes high in calories?
They'll get it soon enough.
We've made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary by the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make his face.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom was throwing a rock at me.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I can think of a few reasons.
Tom became a dad.
They were weak.
Tom didn't know Mary had cancer at all.
It was my fault.
I was hired to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't get it.
Tom was stubborn.
He didn't go there.
I should break your neck.
Why would I be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They all hesitated.
I still think about her.
Today I found out that there is a movie called "The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary missed school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Oh, thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is he still not able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'll pay.
How many more days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I'm not good at that.
Tom has a collection of grandma's.
She was making tea.
Thanks for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Mice are carriers of plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's out.
I start tomorrow.
I wasn’t being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm so pissed off about Tom.
I like roasted chestnuts.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving and caused a car accident.
We were hugged.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
It's all right.
Tom looks worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How to use this camera?
It snowed last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom is an accountant.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would you do that, Tom?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to believe you.
You worry too much about him.
The president announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be cuter.
Tom helped me a little bit.
Am I here too early?
Sounds really cool.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his shoelaces.
I can't turn it off.
We weren't supposed to be up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in the United States did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I need to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom's not listening.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is that what all the excitement was about?
Tom's going somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm bell rings.
I'm sorry I didn't give you more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That's an indisputable fact.
Is it tasty?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom frowned a little.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black.
He surrendered to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogota, and Osaka is similar to Medellín.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop, Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are a species of mammal.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big pot.
If I get to know Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
She wiped her wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he is always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the screen.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write skillfully.
This area is located in a valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not a big deal.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston amongst me.
Please, clear the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he's seen Mary this morning.
I'm squeezing my toast with honey in the morning.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on the planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You're gonna get them back.
Tom kicked his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is thrilled.
I almost couldn't make it.
I was making cake.
Look at the counter.
I was impressed with your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'm going to lose weight.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I love foreign languages.
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
How does that benefit us?
I am with the person I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thank you!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be embarrassed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick utterance.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't like spring.
Everybody has to stay.
We were utterly confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he needed to be redeemed.
This message is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm no match for you.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The internet is a serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He hit the dog with a stone.
Tom stared intently.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
You wrote this book yourself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be arrogant.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you need to plow it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We're not looking.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
No one's listening to you.
All right, convince me.
Now I'm ready for him.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Oblivion and hatred usually go hand in hand.
Tom didn't know that had happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly up to you.
I said yes.
Tom admitted to pouring the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush is respectful of human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of the Loire.
Tom is a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'm gonna help find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn’t eaten yet.
I'd be delighted to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as you like.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He is very meticulous in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs should I do per day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned around to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate to do this.
Dan turned into a beggar.
You have very penetrating eyes.
Isn't that implied?
He seemed tired to me.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I write pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Smoke and go inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom looks rich.
Tom seems more confident.
Would you like a drink of water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not accurate.
They will probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four angles.
I continued to work.
It develops dependence.
Would you like me to come with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and were silent.
Get the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary turned on her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the Mass.
Tom wiped the knife blade off the jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
He has a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I can make it happen.
Are your gums bleeding?
Just have her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer jar on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
He gave me a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I don't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far have you gone?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I should come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how this is possible.
He looked at me sharply through his glasses.
Linda accused Dan of stalking her.
Why would they care?
Let's not bother Tom.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave yourself.
We need to be released.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who can break an aquarium?
I'm sick of it.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
He has struggled with depression for many years in his life.
You want me to grab your bags?
I would entrust that to my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What have you got to worry about?
I need some supper.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is crazy.
There were penguin footprints in the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called for a trucker.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I don't talk fast.
We need to talk in private.
Tom is not impressed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a small town near Boston.
I hope your new boss likes you.
Did you mention the exam results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was gnawing something.
She's studying English.
With such a lush dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
He opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll get through this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit the chewing gum.
Let's do it my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How'd you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
They probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she developed an interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
He ate meat at the time.
You always get me wrong.
With you, we're just as strong.
The president looked very strong.
What to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than I did.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy talked about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a tight town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's ringing, Tom?
He's very handsome.
Beware of the buyer.
Tom often runs away from classes.
Now it's time for compensation.
Most virgins have a hymen.
You can handle it.
Why did you only roast two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
He is interested in French history.
As the bus was delayed, we waited for a long time in the rain.
You'll be all right.
Does she have a dog?
I'm resting.
Mary wore false eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French more fluently than he actually did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture. The speaker was supposed to speak slower.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes got soaked.
This medication calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look silly.
His mother is American.
Just relax a little bit.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
It's moldy bread, which means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fushersky did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked annoyed.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to your boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's working well.
Tom got really sick.
Is there anybody else here?
Tom's always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Shall we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheese to cow cheese.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven’t eaten dairy products in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everyone having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Has that happened to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
Carpenters cut down trees.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zine to the end.
Same-sex couples should not be allowed to get married.
The cow forgot it was once a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a manual job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister tear the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put out your cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There's still no sign of Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Liars make other liars.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is supposedly the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
They're serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
He lifted me up.
Did you call an ambulance yet?
After lunch, we decided to go for a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
Red lights on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood circulates through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
It always smells like mayonnaise.
Lies won't help.
My right toe hurts.
The apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where do we come from? Where do we go?
I really don't know.
Do you have a timer?
Tom bakes for attention.
Dan had no sympathy for any human being.
When did Tom get here?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses are made of stone.
Yes, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one will bother you.
Tom didn't really think about that.
There's wind.
I'm just joking with you.
I don't know where that is.
We've all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a watch.
Just sit there.
Tom can barely walk.
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole team.
At what age did you start menstruating?
You're teasing me.
But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm twelve years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very talkative.
You guys were right.
It's happening.
There were no others injured.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Are you going to eat at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll be sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't piss off Tom.
It's a tedious task.
You need to get him to listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
I wish he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
She often calls me to Mary.
Thank you, dear.
They enlarged the territory of the empire.
I'm not here to hurt people.
Tom probably already knew about it.
My mother's sister is my aunt.
I looked everywhere for them.
Tom is incompetent.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny that.
It went red.
I've got to go.
Who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
His aunt is all alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe it'll wind up tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom had a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Hey, listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll confess.
I'll ask him on your behalf.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you keep these tips in mind.
The excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Put your stuff away.
Where did you put it?
Tom doesn't know how to accept defeat.
Tom is my husband.
What do I get out of it?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for one man.
You don't have to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're so passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't feel bad.
Isn't that unusual?
I got pimples from a wall.
The clock is broken.
Tom must be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom unwraps the scarf from his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower stood amidst the ruins.
He is a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little bit.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Give me the pliers.
Huskies love cold weather.
This is a little loose at the waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Have you forgiven me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would I lie to you, Tom?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed the buffalo.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his dad very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom did a good job today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When is the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning on staying with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you doing?
This is your house now.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I'm feeling better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing only what I want to do.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there were no accusations.
Lust is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom is irresponsible.
I always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw that Mary was about to say something.
I won't be in town next week.
They sowed seed, grew it, and reap it; a colored river turned a mill.
He hates his father.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom was in an accident.
Tom drove Mary home.
I often ski.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I need to be free.
I'm as qualified as Tom.
When will it be my turn?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a typo.
It’s not often that someone buys a hat for a thousand dollars.
Will the police come?
We have to find him first.
Dan laughed at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely escaped getting caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom came back soon.
I'd be in favor.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who will compensate for the Zionist?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
There's nothing bothering me here.
You deceived me.
It's about Greta.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're embarrassing her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner tonight.
I don't eat in restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
You seem to have an infection.
I can't think of anything smarter.
The sky is red at dusk.
I came to wish you luck.
I'd be delighted if you could come.
They must be happy.
We have to fix this.
I don't speak good English.
We'll deal with it.
Bread is made from flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood that very well.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's warm here in hell.
I overlooked that.
This is your doing!
Please come back to me.
It's cold here.
To congratulate you on your wedding.
Kids, you should stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog barking?
That's great!
The palace has a tall tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go pick them up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom stepped aside.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I wouldn't mind if you left.
Tom came here on his own.
I forgot my scarf.
We've suffered a lot.
Tom wanted everyone to think he was dead.
Scientific research often requires difficult compromises.
Tom just had his dentures removed.
I have to try to find him.
I've taken care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with anything?
Go wake up Mary.
You almost missed it.
I hate that trumpet.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you the way you are.
It's ridiculous.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was in jeopardy.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why won't anyone help us?
The hole is narrow.
You should go help him.
Are you enjoying it?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Step aside.
Let's get started!
How long is the journey?
I'm fine, thank you!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's starting to get dark.
Tom was raised.
I'm surprised Tom's gone with Mary.
He was blind from birth.
The book contains 15 biographies.

Tom was just here.
I quit.
How long have you waited?
Socks and shoes are new.

He is buried in Boston.

What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two doing?

His opinions are worthless.
Sign downstairs, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know that Tom lived in Boston?
I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do something that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a dead man.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, it's raining.
Go, you bastard!
They jumped into the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.

Tom taught me how to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom looks terrified.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
I know Tom's in Boston right now.
That's the one.
I can take you.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there is a solution.
You're disorganized.
I'm insisting.
I'm sure Tom's gonna make it this way.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you get the job done?
We have to go back for him.
You're rude.
Do you do any sports?
It just sounds annoying.
Bring him in.
He lied to me all the time.
Tom didn't say he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's completely incorrect.
I'd better call her first.
He's very sociable.
Tom can't wait any longer.
I work out just to look good when I'm naked.
A thousand years is a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I plan to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
Honestly.
We have three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together, we weren't meant to be.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you put it in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Get your toolbox.
Is Tom contributing?
This is a little embarrassing.
We've both been busy.
I'm three hours away.
I like crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took this picture.
Tom shut his mouth.
Don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not naughty.
He never hired them.
I like cakes.
We did nothing for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom is a retired dentist.
That was so sweet.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
He will soon leave his parents' home.
Tom resisted.
The scars are barely visible.
Tom's a dwarf.
I'll take you home.
My husband's a doctor.
It's a spider bite.

Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
It's on my head.
I shook my head.
Tom told me he was planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm off and on.
I'm gonna go change.
He hung up on me.
It may sound like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom continued to work.
Please find me a head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first offer.
Sooner or later, I'm gonna break the film.
Can you just give me a minute?
That could never, ever, ever happen here.
Tom was warming up in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
He swims every day.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
Why don't you call him?
I want to use these.

I baked them a cake.
Tom's very patient.
Let's get started.
Come alone.
Get a pencil out of your pocket.

Write to Tom.

Don't take any chances.
Isn't that good news?
Suppose she was here.
Tom's always pissing me off.
Tom's just watching.
Here's today's schedule.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thanks in advance.
The question is, what are you going to do?
Tom told Mary that he loved her.
Well, he's not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It rained two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you bite me, I'll bite you.
You really should've let me call a cab.
I baked an apple pie.
The cannon of the horse's hooves reassured him.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book covers the whole subject.
I think this is over.
Linda wore modest dresses all the time.
Did you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never says thank you to anyone.
He overcame his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom contacted Mary.
Are you cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure of it.
We're gonna have to get Tom's permission.
Everyone laughed at his joke.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need to see.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I slapped my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would have done the same in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling ourselves.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I have a shower?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times as much as I do.
I rinsed one.
Write down your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
I'll call him later.
These are just as good as them.
She seemed excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary won't be able to come to the party.
Just try to find him.
Tom hung his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's petty.
Is the difference visible?
Come and visit us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do it.
Is this your bag?
It will help you sleep the most.
This is Nina, your niece.
I'll get the premium dishes.
They've been chanting for half an hour.
Dolkuhn has been working very intensively lately, but he doesn’t see the slightest result from it.
Dan found out that Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to my house next Saturday, if you want.
I'm not convinced.
That's not really necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was wandering.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She wanted to be a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hatred.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thanks for stopping by.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
Dan spent last night drinking in a meat tavern.
I'm in.
Do you need a grater?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to make it up to you.
They're coming again.
You're really nice.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a joke anyway.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen a rainbow.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel that I am free.
Just keep smiling.
He didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom has no tea.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
But that's not an argument!
Tom got a pussy.
What am I going to tell the kids now?
Leave him alone, Tom.
I went through the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom being this tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew that Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How was your vacation?
At the time, we were just a few people in the midst of a group of gorillas.

I'll tell my wife.
What if I don't invite Tom to my party?

Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's well known that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happier if you three went back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
Kids blow bubbles.
Tom practiced violin for at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so much fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
I wish Tom had more time for me.
I long for him.
Tom's had a bad day.
My grandmother’s death was a shock.
You're burning the car.
She learned how to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don’t have the willpower when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom's.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is a shotgun.
At your service.
I love watching football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need this much food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little embarrassed.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more stuff I have, the more cleaning I'll have to do.
I've found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don’t forget to use sunscreen.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely audible.
Don't knock.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that gonna happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's been good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was chaos.
Music is love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom will be waiting.
I'm starving you to bend over.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon slowly descended.
Who likes insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom began to laugh.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding it.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn’t matter if you don’t want to do it; you have to anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny eat pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something to take our minds off our problems.
I called her yesterday.
Just let me focus on it.
She sells nautical schools.
Take care of the prisoner.
We all like you.
The child cried and cried for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
He doesn’t look like his brother.
Tom was stubborn.
That was brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom couldn't have done it alone.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
You may be needed.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie this knot.
Give me my money back.
You have to show yourself first.
My dad's a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
You stole my new watch.
It doesn't look much different.
It's been rewritten.
Tom and make room for Mary on the bench.
We're embarrassing him.
It's good. It's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I should be happy or not.
Did you catch her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his journey.
Your excuse is more or less correct.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.

It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the gems last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do it alone.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
Tom must have done it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun is shining at night.
No one will be fired.
There's no one else.
On my way to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught the fog.
They blindfolded me.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to rule.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm hearing well.
Give me those sheets.
You can have mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All comments are unnecessary.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them some help?
Tom rinsed his mouth.
That smells like cheese.
Tom is not deceived.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
“Fidelity without gold is better than gold without honor.”
I didn't want milk.
Tom looks offended.
We know him.
I slept there for hours.
He had a drink in his hand.
What a pair they are!
Is Tom up early this morning?
Your complaints upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's noisy in here.
What can be done?
I assume you found it.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm off and on.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what happens.
Whose house is this?
Tom would've been ruined without Mary's help.
Tom's cooperating.
The snow is one foot deep.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby chews the rattle.
I'm gonna go look for Tom now.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This is gonna do the job for now.
They need to talk.
It didn't happen that way.
It's not like you were wrong.
Tom listened immediately.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
There is no life without hardship.
You misunderstood me.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me a jerk.
You're very attracted to me.
What's for dinner?
Open on page nine.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
Tom was beaten up.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
What can we do for her?
I really like this wine.

Here's your pudding.
Don't swear or I'll rinse your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the ends of the earth.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not entirely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
I guess you're right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom hasn't returned yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
We need to set a trap.
Tom's parked, he'll be right there.
Love me a little, love me a long time.
Tom is in the living room watching cartoons with the kids.

Aren't you panicking?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom's resourceful.
He's an honest man.
Your pajamas are too big.
We'll turn back.
Is there anyone else?
Not all people are equal. That is, however, good news, because it means that not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It’s easy to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.

That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom wondered if Mary had already woken up.
Do you want us to take you home?
That house is built of bricks.
We have not drawn any conclusions.
Tom arrived at about 2:30.
Doesn't sound like God knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got a flood of cats.
The crowd clapped.
I leave clovers to grow on the stripes.
I think Tom's mean.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what are you looking at?
We're out of line.
I was too tired to continue.
Everything has its own sound.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's written on his forehead.

He's always cheerful.
The forest was very quiet.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's intrusive.
Most of the clothing worn by Europeans is produced outside Europe.
Tom is still very busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can look it up on the Internet.
When I was younger, I used to hitchhike.
I couldn’t figure out exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.
We haven't found Tom yet.

You beat her.
The stars have appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I often play volleyball.
Where's the shirt I bought you?
That will teach them the order.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like this.
Tom grunted.
We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks this book is so good.

I'm ready. I'm ready.
He killed him to avenge his deceased father.
Tom took the cookie.
I have been learning French since the age of 13.
Men are not so different from women.
Evgenia shared with us her favorite oils for facial cleansing and skin care.
I'm sick of French.
I don't care if there's 20 girls.
The bull is hurting.
Tom's walking.
Will you be open tonight?
They don't understand.
Born in 1960.
Can I have one?
Baburi are usually mild in taste.
I'm shocked.
It might rain today.
We were ready.
Let's go to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Somebody told me that.
You're beautiful.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
You got a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and watch her.
Wouldn't you start cutting your hair out of that?
How are you gonna get away?
Let’s start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you going to make that happen?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's ever met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That’s what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these earrings from my grandmother.
I have no problem drinking.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing.
It's in excellent condition.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
She loves fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom listened.
I think I was wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be true.
You look thoughtful.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It's happening.
The noise will wake the baby.
I ate spinach.
You know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom sat on the couch with Mary and watched TV.
Nothing's bothering us.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom's wearing a stethoscope.
Good to see you, Tom.
How are yours?
I don't usually go to work on Mondays.
I'm a fool to believe them.
Tom might need a little help.
They went to church every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He'd be broken.

Who gave them that kind of money?
We have to buy them a present.
When did the war end?
Was the dishwasher working?
Tom is a married man.
Like Tom said, the soup's too salty.
Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come outside?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that? No.
We could talk about Tom.
What's this all about?
You're gonna have to study harder next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
No one likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Whoa!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than grant your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom's got two spots.
I'll send you the recipe.
It'd look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like the most.
Your transgressions have defiled the graves of your forefathers.
Don't get discouraged now.

The cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He can't concentrate on his academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They became dependent.
I just want money.
I'm not saying nasty things about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I've recovered completely.
I was the only one who knew where Tom was going.
How badly was Tom hurt?
Was he sympathetic?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, I get blamed.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
Beggars can't choose.
Is there sugar?
Dan and Linda eventually moved to London.
She suddenly fainted.
He looked ridiculous.
He plays in a band.
We live together now.
You've been busy.
I'm sorry. Isn't that a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship has changed course.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?

I have no intention of explaining anything.
Aprili-li-li!
That's what Tom used to say.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you're gonna have a lot of work to do.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
He enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most of them are right-handed.
Should I take pictures with or without flash?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was on.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem on my own.
They are too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's an adult now.
We do not sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes to minors.
I came back by bus.
Here's how we do it.
He doesn’t behave like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe it was a cat.
The fight seems to be coming to an end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's a nutcase.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up from the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and it's over.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be okay.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't ruin the party.
I can do that.

I'll go if Tom goes.
We'll be back in a month.

I'll figure it out.
The cure worked.
Tom can play the guitar.
Who broke it?
The line is short.
I've had enough of Tom.
I like you very much.
I want to take you somewhere where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't remember buying this.
He saved a sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up, you lazy boy!
How long ago was that?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd avoid Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's continue this conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I've let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?

I kind of like it.
I love golf.
No one really likes us.
It's very rare.
I'm not good at this.

Get out of here.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Tom's eavesdropping.
Is anybody listening?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know that.
I want to fuck her.
I can come back tomorrow.
When did you get up?
I'm all in love with you.
Tom is in his bedroom talking on the phone.
We had a hard time.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on a chain.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom is in the hospital recovering from an overdose.
He broke the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were about to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him. She hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's a big guy.
When you go out with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this is neither the right time nor the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom is distrustful.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup lifted.
That's good training.
The capital is unique.
I should have said no.
I had to consider what might happen.
That was my tactic.
I have lived here for many years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for myself.
I know you did your best.
Tom shouldn’t have written his password on the inside of the cover of the notebook.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I should feel sorry for them.
I'm not bargaining.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don’t comment on the articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
That's a cannon.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Keep Tom busy.
It's just words.
There was a brief silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met in Boston last year.
Tom curses too much.
No one walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
It didn't bother me.
Look what Tom got.
I don't like to cook.
Tom was irresistible.
I agree with the plan.
Justice is expressed through action.
I don't know if you know or not, but here in America, you're supposed to tip the waiter.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
I walk with her.
That would be fine.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Go while you still can.
Tom was a little embarrassed about Mary.
I don't need them.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the carriages.

She's a nerd.
The lemonade is cold.
The lamp swayed back and forth.
Tom seems insecure.
I have nothing else to look for.

He can't do that.
Why should I worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Will you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banner in the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell from the tree.
Tom told Maria that he had never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see it.
I'm on my way.
I was half asleep.
Don’t expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good things and the books.
This is so much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's going astray.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
He stabbed me with something.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I stared at the man.
Take care of him, Tom.
They look familiar.
We have a job for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river passes through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you with me.
I like to play golf.
Tom was deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you get any sleep?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in an enclosed room.
He had a great concert.
No answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a painting.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're burdened enough with worry.
I don't think Tom's gonna be much help.
Tom looks worried.
I care about him.
Tom is amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom came closer.
Tom was shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom is very sympathetic.
Let's keep it short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could've handled it.
This is nobody's fault.
I don't like the taste of onion.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom runs to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The cottage was fully equipped, with a swimming pool, barbecue, football field and a billiard table.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While he was eating pizza, he annoyed his sister.
We should've given up sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's being polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My efforts so far have been in vain.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom turned on the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
That sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trustworthy and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't give in.
What did you and Tom do yesterday?
I'm not gonna stick around.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it at the butcher's.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why should I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two kinds of Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who are you living with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed talking on the phone.
These are great.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I'm gonna need some time to get them over.
The noise disturbed the whole city.
A person who loves flowers can’t be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you give Tom the note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who can speak English?
Tom was freaking out.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears assault clothes.
Tom was barefoot.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem. It's mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
It's possible Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brat.
Too bad you ruined it.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
Why did you want to see me?
I think I figured out what time we were supposed to leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First, you have no right to draw conclusions. Second, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
It’s boring to the public.
Growing cattle.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you later.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom has a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Was Tom involved?
The thief turned into a policeman.
We're gonna let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom is angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could help you more.
You can't see Tom anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting alone in the park.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building. When I passed by it in a car, I did not recognize it.
Is it possible that this is the only thing that exists?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children sat in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It won’t be easy to do without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.
He works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
She was sedated.
This has nothing to do with the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed to be deeply disturbed by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
I'm here.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's leaking.
You're gonna get wrinkles.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser ejects a jet of boiling water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I have no home to return to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
I’ve always been helped.
They don't want that.
Tom takes over.
I’ll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said if he wins the lottery, he'll buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
Above all, be kind to older persons.
Gems include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
First you have to ask your mother for permission.
I'll take Tom's place.
Why did you come to Boston?
You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You've been chasing chickens for a long time.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I had a quick lunch.
Tom remembered all sorts of things that no one else remembered.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I learned, French was the easiest for me.
Tom did his homework.
I counted to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you make?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Explain the idea specifically.
Can I get a tattoo?
They were all so busy.
I lied to both of you.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don’t drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's awful.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Can you get there by car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do what's right for me.
Tom's got a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I stepped on something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
He has always been poor.
That's a beautiful link.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom yelled at Mary.
Were you home alone?
He extorted a lot of money from her.
Can you help me figure that out?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to go back and see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'm gonna go find someone else.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make spider webs.
You really talk a lot.
It may be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
You don’t always have to believe what the other person says.
He is in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's eldest daughter is unmarried.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom is in pain.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're deranged!
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
Sometimes people ask me what I’m going to do when I retire.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think it helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom can do anything.
Soon the sound stopped.
Who cut your hair?
I don't really understand myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police car.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep walking.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom gonna get in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom wasn't getting away.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It was a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
I think I might sneeze.
You're welcome.
Peter might need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom likes to swim.
I'll scream.
I'm not your babysitter.
What's our status?
Do you want me to keep an eye on him?
You're a real man-hating man.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's in charge?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink this water.
No one's talking.
What made you think of contacting them?
There's nothing we can do.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Would you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don’t want to be treated differently than before.
You should be okay.
I followed the rules.
Tom is a widower.
I think Tom's heartless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You already did.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who is laughing, but not who is crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red scarf around his neck.
The girl said nothing.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He relaxed listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom did not accept Mary’s invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say his party was gonna start?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would be happy with Mary.
Dan was doing a really good job.
My legs still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
I may have fainted.
It's hard to gauge his ability.
Oh, that's good.
I know a husband who's sitting over there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I am open to everything.
I used to listen to you.
Stop where they are.
Are you a cheater?
"She loves music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber cut it.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
The nurse gave her a flu shot.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why can't I ever win?
Tom fell off a ladder while cleaning his gutters.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Silence, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday falls on Sunday.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's doing push-ups.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought I was imagining it.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it unless you show him.
You bought something for Mary.
Nothing looks more crazy than a drunk.
Take it, Tom.
Tom began to undress.
I know Tom is suffering.
It looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This is almost working.
I can't concentrate on all this noise.
Deal the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medication will ease the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't that wait?
They'll pay for their arrogance.
Dan didn't miss an episode of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're inspecting the entire area.
Don't forget, Tom still loves you.
Tom told me he'd like me to visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everyone.
This is where we'll be.
Why are they doing this?
I went to college for four years and got nothing but a poor diploma.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom here.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, there were only ashes.
Tom likes every vegetable except cabbage.
Try to put yourself in his shoes.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make it up to you.
People can't do miracles.
That's a little rude.
They decided to exclude him from their society.
Those who confuse the verb endings "-st" and "-st" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened after that?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're everywhere.
I wasn't counting on it.
I was careless.
I just saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom caught cleaning up.
We're so pissed.
Tom's not that old.
Everyone knows how to drive.
Tom welded two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I gave her nothing.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences for the whole month.
That was awful.
We're glad you're here.
You made some money.
It really sucks.
Do you want cheese?
They say that eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is chaste and devout.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to pass the test.
I think we're gonna join in.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom's keeping his car clean.
You're interesting.
I can win this time.
All human beings descended from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm all set.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent's open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go shopping.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What's that?
Can people really be so foolish as to think that the entire population of Georgia, who speaks a Caucasian language that has neither phonemes nor letters in common with English, can fully master English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were in vain.
There's too much I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the lunatic.
They laughed at Tom.
Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.
Each student has their own closet.
Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom is right for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a beautiful sound?
This isn't the first time Tom's been late.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom grabbed his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to get rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Take care of this mess.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
Borrowing books.
I can barely move.
Tom wondered how good Mary was as a singer.
Look at my fingers.
You took my seat.
Tom's a bad guy.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not a musician, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I'd love to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned his lesson the hard way.
He showed the fakes to my friends.
I give my employees the right to leave early.
Are you alone here?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too short.
I'm so sorry.
What books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm fed up.
He was eating a kale salad.
I'm going to run.
Tom's chewing something.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
He has never been to Boston.
I like to be independent.
Tom's pretty popular.
I have a big family.
No one can help me now.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and take a look.
Do you think you're attractive?
Innocence is often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's heart rate's up.
There's a restaurant around here, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept staring at how kind, compassionate, courageous her boyfriend was, and I don’t know what.
Have you lied to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
She believes in Mary.
Busy besh.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Because of this victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why it always has to be me.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I'm getting awkward with heteronormative propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't take it much longer.
The virtues themselves are a reward.
The whole thing makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We need to advertise on TV.
Tom nodded silently.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing is right for me.
They're having a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This candlestick is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it a real diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
He seems very sleepy.
Yesterday I made mushroom biscuits.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom's not gonna be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in science!
Although the worm has both male and female reproductive systems, it needs another individual to fertilize.
Failure embarrassed Lisa.
I heard Tom got sick.
Tom fainted.
Don't smoke in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm on my way right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
It is estimated that the surface temperature of the sun is about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
Crowd's out of control.
Tom started to work.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
Cover it.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the hole?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm gonna get Tom to question him.
That was embarrassing.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn’t trust her.
It's possible Tom's gone.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did Tom want to eat?
I have Tom's keys.
Tom was rejected.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know a lot about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't impressed.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
Just in time.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are for adults.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
A cavalier would never do such a thing.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was incomprehensible.
This is wonderful.
Tom, don't act like Tosho to me.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I would have said no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant then.
He never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to rent a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold.
Luckily, the shed is stable, otherwise the storm last night would have brought it down anyway.
I heard she got caught.
Tom has it all written down somewhere.
There is no good news.
And who are you working for these days?
I'm gonna quit.
Mary’s eyes shone with joy.
It's evil to curse.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's a conservative.
How good are you guys?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's making herself mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom deceived us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The vendor scammed him.
Everything is in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid a fine.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at ten?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll get her to help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's simple.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and approached her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I'm looking forward to seeing the new version of the Tatoeba.
It all seems pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why aren't you singing?
Did Tom really do that?
I didn’t know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was an honor to be asked to give a speech.
Tom's not into sports.
I'm amazed, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Show off your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt so alone.
I love trying new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
Haven't you eaten yet?
Tom got me a cab.
He did miracles.
The glands secrete chemicals in the body.
It wasn't my idea.
Tom is resting.
Don't run around.
It's best if you don't talk so much.
This is a new model.
I was helping her.
The music unites.
This is just a simulation.
Good to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He is overly generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
He injured his leg when he fell from a bicycle.
Why Do Rabbits Have Big Ears?
Come here! Come here!
You could have said no.
Why wouldn't you let me help?
It's going to happen soon.
Hey, it's stuffy in here, get me out before I choke.
It's gonna happen what it's gonna happen.
I heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom was trying to say.
Is Tom alone there?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to tie Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Juliet.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was very polite.
I guess I'll have to wait a little longer.
You can go and stay if you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak louder?
Where will the meeting be?
Let's play "Truth or Dare".
His conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom began to scroll through the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom loves flowers a lot.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I fainted.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very polite.
Do you know who I am?
Why aren't you listening?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How long do you spend in front of a computer?
My wife's getting tired of her daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amöbes are unicellular organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long have you been in Boston?
Tom twisted my arm.
You're nuts!
How late was the train?
Let's park over there.
That's so stupid.
Yesterday it was hot, but today it's more resilient.
I'm cold.
He was walking in front of me.
Give that back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair to me.
Someone may have been following them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a box.
I wish I'd met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn the lights off.
Do you want me to come to your place?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This is not gonna work.
He just passed away.
The kids were so excited after the party that they couldn’t sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel so guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive father.
An international language would be very useful to humanity.
I was helping them.
Have you decided yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't lie to me at all.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave a baby alone.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom started to eat.
She's kind-hearted.
What time is it?
Have a nice weekend.
Would you like a soda?
Tom winked at the girls.
We had a terrible fight.
Tom is different nowadays.
Throw them off deck.
Japan as a country has many different characteristics.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
Monks used to play tennis in monasteries.
Don't be so perverse!
Tom wants evidence.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your paycheck.
Sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got little hands.
It worries me.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam covered mathematics, physics and chemistry.
Tom's laundering money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Didn't you say you could swim?
Don't put any pressure on Tom.
They betrayed me.
And there's no paper.
Tom can't express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll get a picture of you giving a speech.
This sentence has five words.
She ate lamb flakes, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We waited outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier like this.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go in that direction.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not exactly an option.
How old were you when your parents divorced?
French is hard.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor examines the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
Smoke rises in the air.
The printer is not working.
I'll walk you to the door.
It's dark in here.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We could order a pizza.
Tom's much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We drink water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary represented her team in the match.
Tom doesn't like a party.
It looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm an only child.
We don't want any more accidents.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'm gonna kill you.
Most people have a strong resistance to getting up early, even when it’s necessary.
Give me the gloves.
I was watching Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanicians should understand oils and lubricants for motors.
How was yesterday?
You have to study hard.
We can't just fire them.
They have families.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelet.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
You're sick of it, aren't you?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remains unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I took out my knife.
They danced.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
A boy came running to me.
Tom looks very tired right now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I assembled it.
Tom was calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituent units of living beings.
They're entertaining her.
I have to go get changed.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunba died one day after the birth of my older sister.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
He quickly lost himself in the crowd.
For the record, I'm not interested at all.
No, I'm still a beaker.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That amazed me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you blink when we kiss?
Somebody's gonna see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that? I don't know.
I misjudged her.
It's almost over.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my dad?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's snoring.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't say that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted a bigger ship than his brother.
God created the world.
It's not too early.
Can I eat it?
They painted the frames of the windows yellow.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I screwed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one talks about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does the class start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You guys were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird lifted the branch with its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same guy he was three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to make time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom struggled to free himself.
What do they want me for?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not a good time.
I'll be home by noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at a time.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom's not old-fashioned.
The question is, how did Tom do that?
I swear it was them.
Did he have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best feature.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has wavy hair.
Long live the Soviet Union!
It's so strong.
I'd like to buy a pineapple.
I was at home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come for me.
The simple question is where.
The bush is burning.
Tom was offended.
I'm feeling guilty.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Each country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's been drinking tequila.
My grandmother's deaf, in other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You talk a lot.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's got something going on.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I pay my respects.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I will pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Did you have a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to get in the habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got his heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom was out.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that too?
What did they find?
He lied to my eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to swing.
They're listening.
I didn't know that Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll go away.
They'd just get in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
Everyone was on guard.
He's a little hard of hearing, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's headed south.
Love is like oxygen.
They're for you.
That's a very dry explanation.
Walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't that awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was framed for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We are all eager to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt one-piece.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
Dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative and division is not.
I'm joking.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going.
Whose handwriting is this?
Have you seen what’s in today’s newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six cups of coffee a day.
Tom snapped loudly.
It was Better.
Tom started snoring.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed at her.
Maybe Tom'll be dead by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll get there in time.
Tom was terrified.
The can's empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The money blurred my glasses.
So, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the flag?
Cheer up!
I told you it'd be hard to pull off.
I think I found one.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't understand you.
Even though I'm a godly man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom has to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the award.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does the same thing that Mary does.
There's something we need to investigate.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have a lot of time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you breastfeeding?
He drank in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started to say something, but Mary shut him up.
We met at the meana.
How was Tom acting?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The drug should be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
I guess it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I fell on the wrong side.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't growl.
Tom was awake.
Tom made Mary angry.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom is good at that.
Tom might be here today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help me?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I came by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do it.
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom looks sad.
I was home all night.
We left at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me whatever you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is of another dimension.
They're bothering me.
What's the weather like?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure for it yet.
Each member must be present.
She didn’t understand the joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom dead?
Did you get her name?
It doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me take a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
Flour is made from wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're fair.
I'll go.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're so pretty.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What is Happiness?
Dan shot Linda's dog.
He tore out his collarbone while he was playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is blind.
Do you really believe this guy is a magician?
He moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was impertinent.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I wanted to cook something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop along the way.
I heard Tom weeping.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look furious?
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's closing time.
Leave it to me.
The stone slid down the hill.
She went to the hairdresser.
Tom is insane.
Let's do it again!
Doesn't hurt his heart.
No need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
At that time, Tom was swimming.
This penguin is so cute.
You're such a nerd.
Sorry, but we do not accept credit cards.
You were fine here.
They look terrified.
I could make your job easier.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave the house in slippers.
I think Tom's a jackass.
It hurts from a terrible infection and the ovary swells.
I don't need counseling.
This doesn't work.
It doesn't come into consideration.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
Sometimes he behaves strangely.
We'd hang them.
Now is probably not the right time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Believe in Justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a blackberry cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him now.
Stick to the subject.
She really likes to gossip.
I have tons of questions.
This is an interesting, funny and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We've got it all.
How much is one beer?
Tom says he can't play tennis.
Where did you find it?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with it.
We must not give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we broke up.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know if I should sit or run.
Don't you think it's too hot for the Decembers?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you falling for him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is U.S. territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in this room?
I've already thought about that.
I would do anything for her.
Somebody must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven’t called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You cut your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was being a little polite.
Tom decided to become vegan.
I don't have time today.
No one wants to buy these things.
Neither here nor there.
Telephone directories are fascinating.
You don't have to be defensive.
This is the best pizza in town.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
