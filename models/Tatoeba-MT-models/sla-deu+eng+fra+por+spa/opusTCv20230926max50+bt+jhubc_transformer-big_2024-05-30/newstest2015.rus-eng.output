FANO of Russia will hold the final Expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session “Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release received by the editors of "Lingerie.Ru".
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the results of the Expert session for the year and form a final list of indicators for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in the series of events on the formation of a unified approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have managed to do this, and the final version of the normative documents is under negotiation.
According to the results of the next session, we should complete the formation of scientometric and expert analysis processes, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment," said Elena Aksenova, Head of Expert and Analytical Department of FANO of Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes of Russia.
A resolution is expected as a result.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: the city of Moscow, Solyanka street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical uniformities in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to search among the stars related, that is, arising from the same cluster.
The authors published the results of their research in the journal Nature, and they can be found briefly on the university’s website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulent mixing in gas clouds, preceding the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the stellar cluster, by its chemical composition it is possible to determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of relatives stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of simulations carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, the researchers used a supercomputer to simulate two streams of interstellar gas that together formed a cloud.
Over a period of several million years, this object, under the influence of its own gravity, is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
The scientists added label paints to the initial gas flows and found that rapid turbulent stirring in the cloud achieves a high degree of chemical uniformity.
According to astrophysicists, their study proves that it is possible to search for stars-related by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Karratha police arrested 20-year-old after chasing motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was seized after it was driven at a speed of 125 km/h in a speed limit of 70 km/h and across the bushland to escape police in Pilbara.
A transport police patrol in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning, finding that it was speeding up to 125 km/h when it left a service station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on Burgess Road, then turned into a bushland, as a result of which the police lost sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were seen near the house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police charged the 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is due to appear before the Karratha Peace Court on September 23.

George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will appear in court on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, has been indicted at the High Court hearing in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
It is alleged that Webster attacked her when she was "unconscious, asleep and unable to consent."

Judge Lady Ray has scheduled a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh for November 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not “knock the door” in connection with the new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “knock on the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
“As for our retaliatory measures in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated,” he said.
And when we understand what our European and American partners will be worthy of this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to it.
This will not have to do with knocking the door, some offenses, misunderstood," the minister stressed.
We will, first of all, build on our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners on their adequacy, contractability and reliability.
According to the steps taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what partners are achieving, the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If they say out loud that "these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to go to it to punish Russia", that is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO exit of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, then no.
On the contrary, we want to more actively master the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we consider to be the EU’s discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and, at the same time, anti-dumping measures are applied against sectors of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use WTO mechanisms to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third EU energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to properly use lilac in garden design?
Questions answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since lilac after flowering loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It blends well with many cultures.
And next to the mermaid, you can and should plant both plants that are decorative at other times, and blooming simultaneously with it.
Another plus of mermaids is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base and even a resemblance to a garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that best suits the design of your garden.
In Karelia for the sale of counterfeit money convicted resident of the Leningrad region
As reported in the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in Olonetsk and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already inherited in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonetsky District Court.
And to end the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, was staged in Segeju.
The investigation proved guilt over several episodes of sales of counterfeit money dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court ruled to replace the term of imprisonment by four years with serving in a colony of general regime.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Recall that last week, two other sellers of counterfeit money, which were paid by them in Petrozavodsk stores, were convicted.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them was imprisoned for five years, the other for four.
Each is fined 500 thousand rubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held near the pledge stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the embankment of the Sedova name in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
We met for the first time twenty-three years ago, when a pawnstone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who were not returned by the sea," said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Sea Shipping Company.
Then the event was performed by the city wind orchestra, and the pupils of the cadet classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the banner of Victory.
The meeting ended with the laying of flowers on the pawnstone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, tin, wool and many other equipment and equipment).
In addition, there were military equipment and weapons on board the ships - 3,800 depth bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harricane fighters, in dismantled condition.
At the same time, the escort convoy consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which there were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that would protect trade union organization as a civil right.
“Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs,” says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who is co-chair of the Progressive Faction Congress.
That’s why I’m proud to introduce the Workers’ Empowerment Act, along with John Lewis, the symbol of the civil rights movement.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as it does against other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of union opponents.
Amendments to the Labour Relations Regulation Act to allow workers who face discrimination for participating in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts – and receive damages and penalties – are a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative – at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis, and the co-authors of the bill are proposing is to recall a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that unions have been subjected to in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans have once supported countries around the world in adopting, expanding, and respecting labor rights.
There was a time, which millions of Americans still remember, when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution drafted to ensure that Hideki Tojo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that read openly: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and to every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right would have no legal force; measures aimed at this end would be considered illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the United Nations as a world treaty, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests.”
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize unions — and to have that union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies — must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the strength of the nation, but has increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, the trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and elevated an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers us as well.
Official recognition of labour rights as human rights – and expanding civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against trade unions – is long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the US, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the enactment of a Louisiana law, which his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under this measure, which was signed into effect by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginadel in June and was due to take effect on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to receive patients in a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that at the moment, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions, continuing to seek such authority.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to take action to obtain authority," Judge John deGravells wrote in his ruling.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month, during which the judge will render a more permanent decision on this law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to get hospital credentials.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from the insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from the two clinics who had not acted as plaintiffs in the case and had also applied for admission authority.
Louisiana is part of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, and courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admission laws impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect on the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admission authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while their applications for admission authority await a decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas on domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the range of retail chains should be Russian-made, according to a deputy of the State Duma from the faction "Fair Russia" Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <...> For the rest of the groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic manufacturers," Nilov said.
Along with amendments to the article “On the basics of state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation”, the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of a package of stimulus measures for Russian manufacturers.
On the shelves will appear several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to Sergey Litvinenko, a lawyer for the company “Taxpayer”, a member of the independent expert center “Public Duma”, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
In the plus there will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will increase.
In addition, they will get the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will be mastered faster, and will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, however, not immediately," the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break into the shelves of local stores due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, after the embargo, this niche is freed and you can breathe a sigh of relief.
But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections, the Russian market will receive food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.
In other words, now there is a "moment of calm", when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products," said Tamara Kasyanova, First Vice-President of the all-Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors".
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow to anchor the sector to local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that, at the expense of subsidies from another state, are cheaper.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will unfold between companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots far from all articles.
And in this situation, retail chains will have to “catch up” the share of Russian goods to half the assortment.
In this regard, there are growing fears that low-quality goods will enter the shelves.
Perhaps, under the guise of manufactured in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be supplied," the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer from this situation, since the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to inflate prices for the latter as a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was revived by economists in February this year due to the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the question of abandoning imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is designed to oblige retailers to take into account domestic manufacturers when forming orders for suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the path of import substitution, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," said Deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, a powerful impetus can get and meat production.
As you know, the largest share of imports remains beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% are still Russian products," Kasyanova said.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import substitution and can accelerate this process.
However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, because it requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that full import substitution will not occur, but significant steps in this direction will be taken.
In addition, it is not enough to establish quotas, it is still necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees and will provide", - the expert states.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video in memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research reported that those living in regions and remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New drugs may slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed the medical path of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also influenced the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that a late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of out-of-home services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to home and support programs for people receiving treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young Gold Coast mother, Elisha Niv, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, in the Kuzhenersky district will open the doors of a new FAP
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibeljak was started in April this year and was carried out according to a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the medical and preventive institution built is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical care to the residents of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaibelyak and the villages of Dementievo, Puncheriumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibelyak, Shinur and Chashkayal.
The new paramedic and obstetric point will replace the current FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long ago exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will open soon.
Killed four-month-old son in a state of intoxication, Novocheboksarka will appear in court
A resident of Chuvashia will be on the bench of the defendants for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary completed the investigation of the criminal case against the 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence.
The investigation established that on July 26 this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of her godmother’s child in Cheboksary.
After a long feast, the new boxer decided to stay and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, a drunken woman put him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, according to the press service of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan in Chuvashia, was sent to the court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp increase in prices?
As a result of cross-sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not comply with the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year even less - 6.5%.
However, according to Kommersant newspaper, this week the mayor should make “small but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth in incomes of the population.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be expected?
The current situation suggests a one-off shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," a source in the Ministry of Finance said.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and predict a price increase of 8% in 2014.
The main effect of food bans will come together with the possible introduction of a sales tax (VAT) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will be in February, after which the annual growth rate of prices will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation introduced “accurate sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the Analytical Department of AForex FC:
Price increases are already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products began to rise in price, the government was forced to launch measures to systematically monitor price stability in order to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates price increases.
The key drivers of the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal pace of capital outflows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population to foreign currency, as well as the embargo on imports of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures had remained under control, the cost of a basket of minimum sets of products would not have jumped 12% in a single quarter.
The ban on the importation of food products triggered a shock of supply on the domestic market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of growth of the inflationary component.
If we add to this the fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsening prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, director of analytical department "Alpari"
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in zero it was also higher than the current level, another thing is that then it was compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think by the end of the year, inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, asset manager of the Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still successfully contained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, primarily on the financial sector - it can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which usually manifest themselves in the purchase of cash in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But price increases start traditionally after the summer calm and may become more noticeable this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to stand, since Russia still has financial savings.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decrease in the number of homeowners
The drop, driven by an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead gardening centers to lose tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach “the primary age of gardening,” according to a study by HTA reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people renting homes spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of paving yards in front of a parking house, and the reduction in the size of the garden as other factors posing a threat to the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK has the lowest level of spending on household goods for gardeners.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have reported that renting housing and the lack of space for a garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at RHS, said: “Cultivating plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the retail trade of horticultural goods as a result of the increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted a mass cleansing in the Fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture announced only the removal of the executive director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatyana Angelova, who was responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program until then, has been released, BGNES reports citing the newspaper Trud.
I did not attend the board of directors of the fund because we are not members of the board by law, but I was later informed that I was released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not reported on the foundation’s website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday," Angelova said.
Its place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of “Investment lending” in the central fund in “Agriculture” in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolay Dachev was also released.
Until now, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the fund "Agriculture" in the city of Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the foundation, Atige Aliyeva-Veli, retained her post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over spying report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has summoned the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat for clarification over a report of U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. attorney general and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the message, saying that all the leading countries were spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany’s top intelligence agency had also made Ankara a target for intelligence, sparked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's Biggest Companies Join Forces Against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social media, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China's largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
the Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% of each of the Internet companies, the Wanda Group said in a statement.
Registration of the company is planned in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu’s search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda’s infrastructure.
In addition to a chain of 40 luxury hotels, Wanda manages at least 49 commercial properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a movie studio and a theme park in Qindao, a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea coast.
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $ 960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest operator of cinemas in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all of its shopping malls, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, the development of which will be carried out by the newly created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will lead the new company, thanks to the merger Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform should become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dong Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract customers online so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon sales services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the biggest cake in online commerce,” said Wanda Wang Jianlin, CEO of the company.
“Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation, everyone’s chances are roughly equal,” he said.
China’s e-commerce market is the world’s largest, and McKinsey & Co. estimates its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has risen to 632 million, according to Bloomberg data: this is more than the population of any country in the world, with the exception of India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015, this number could grow to 850 million people.
the Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huaten was until recently the richest man in China, however, according to the Bloomberg Millionaire Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already overtaken him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu leader Robin Li is now ranked third among China’s wealthiest people, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is ranked fourth.
“It’s very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people join forces to challenge the even richer,” said Cao Lei, director of China’s e-commerce research center in Hangzhou.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: "Rome can not be built in one day."
The fact that it is not so easy to compete with Alibaba not only for new companies, but also for well-deserved leaders of the world of Internet trade, is evidenced by the report on the financial performance of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something between eBay and Amazon.com, but between April and June, the Chinese company earned more than its two U.S. competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit for the period almost doubled that of its competitors – it almost tripled year-on-year to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has a huge potential to generate money, largely thanks to its mobile apps,” said an analyst at Arete Research Service in Hong Kong.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the website of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July amounted to 188 million, which is significantly higher than the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter were made on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place on September 16.
The road-show of the company, preceding this event, will start on September 3.
Alibaba’s IPO is expected to be a record in the history of the NYSE and will allow the company to raise about $ 20 billion.
So far, the record for the volume of funds raised on U.S. exchanges belonged to the payment system Visa, which in 2008 held the initial placement of its shares, earning $ 17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the retail chains should be of Russian production, according to the deputies of the State Duma.
They drafted a bill on the subject.
We are talking about amendments to Article 8 of the Federal Law "On the basics of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
Important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of products of domestic production in stores should be for each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in the winter, so a "discount" will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which sets a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, the newspaper Izvestia reports.
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the Federal Law "On Retail Markets" was introduced in the lower house of Parliament, which proposes to revive farmers' markets in Russia, where small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and municipal officials in Calvià to Mallorca's public prosecutor's office on Friday.
The chief of the Calvia police on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious center of unrestrained drinking Magaluf.
Inspector General José Antonio Navarro was detained on corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online edition of Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion from the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of Mallorca’s anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption allegations and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfied nightclub owners say that protectionism from the authorities is seriously affecting the state of their business.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
We must not jeopardize our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British holidaymaker sucking 24 men during a bar race.
The authorities of the island have since tried to stop the hooliganism in a drunken state among holidaymakers of Magaluf, minimizing the number of notorious alcohol runs in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the blowjob incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage bar race together were fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55000 ($73000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous alcoholic intoxication accidents associated with the insane fun known as “balconing” when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions that affected flights at Adelaide Airport
SPRING has prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening at 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short showers with gusts of wind, including a thunderstorm that started shortly before 8 p.m. and poured out almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter released an early portion of spring last week, temperatures fell again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.
The rough conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in boarding the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but fell into a windshield zone — a sudden change in wind speed or direction at a short distance — and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused several other flights to be delayed, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with the likelihood of one or two showers.
The calculation of the estimates of construction projects in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
Issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to networks, the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control.
The FAS created an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, Vadim Solovyov, head of the Department of Housing, Construction and Natural Resources Control of the FAS, said that "today's calculation of the estimates of construction projects is absolutely incomprehensible."
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, according to the FAS.
And they offer the cost of construction of state-owned objects at the design stage to determine on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the estimated norms and unit prices for technological operations used today.
These proposals have been included in the road map and are currently under consideration in the Ministry of Transport.
"Replacing traditional estimates in construction with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," Solovyov said.
After all, now every bolt and nut is calculated in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors".
In Minneapolis, I agree.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of the cost of structural elements already exist: methods have been developed for calculating prices for constructive solutions, drawing up estimates for these indicators," said Elena Zhukova, head of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture of the Ministry of Construction.
The field of road construction was selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but another mechanism has not yet been proposed to the business.
“As for the proposed calculations on the structural elements, in practice it is difficult to implement, because in the construction of buildings often used completely different technologies,” he said.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely thanks to the state order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of NP "Expert community of professionals of the state order" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director of Engineering at the Rosatom Capital Construction Industry Center, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors in this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only under the condition that access to contracts is maximally fenced off from someone’s controlling influence.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a system of state orders in such a way that the same executor is not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, it will be necessary to provide the customer with the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the customer’s staff and budget costs for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer’s specialists will need to have knowledge that allows to assess the quality of the works performed by the contractors, as well as their safety.
Often, such a breakdown will need to determine who will be responsible for the security of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to disinterest in receiving a state order for an incomplete amount of work and a small amount of contract.
The deputy head of the expert-consulting center of the Institute of Procurement Alexander Evstashenkov believes that now the state order procedure has turned into a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And gave an example: "the participant when filling out the application must specify "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "must be", "from", "more", "less", "analogue", "or", "type", "similar type", "not lower", "below", "above", "may", "previously", "may not have", "previously", "previously", "may".
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of the application submitted by the contractors.
Another problem 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the participant's "paper" proposal at the application stage.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to assess only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, the implementation of which has not even begun, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can be evaluated only when they are accepted.
The expert council also proposed moving margin income from the upper to the lower echelon to eliminate intermediate contractors.
The chairman of the expert council, state secretary, deputy head of the FAS Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor must be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it will turn out, as in the famous repeat of Arkady Raykin's "Atelier": "Is there a claim to the buttons?".
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the territory recovered from fighting.
The start of schooling brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the kindergarten "Pashosh", which hit the rocket, removed the traces of fragments from the walls and children's slides before the arrival of students.
“We’re a little scared, but happy to look to the future,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was "a bit strange" to start going to school again.
“It was a difficult time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not go out or leave their homes, moving to safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian landmine, doubt whether they should go back.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that has been heavily damaged by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas’ demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip, and an estimated 250,000 people have found shelter in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continuing, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Housing Price Index for the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined increase of 4.2 per cent for June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the growth in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices in Sydney have risen 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne they have risen 11.7 percent.
The next largest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which underwent government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 percent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties put up for sale over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high sales rate and the current conditions with low interest rates, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to rise over the next three months,” he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of gold miners and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly Bolshaya Kazanskaya) 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century has hardly changed since the time of construction, except for the old.
Strangers come here as an excursion, and residents suffer more than rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is almost 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, squeaky staircase.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls cracked, and in the lumens of peeled plaster, the street is visible in some places.
Everything seems to be on its fair side.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's true."
Living in an 18th-century wooden house is very difficult," says Tatyana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on the state guard, but the money for its maintenance is not allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last renovation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poorly held, but the foundation is all rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be happy under such conditions?
The road passes directly under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana moves the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: under the windows flows a stream of cars.
You see, the windows are buzzing all the time, we can't open the windows, and we're used to the noise.
People get used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thank your husband, his hands are golden.
I have two bedrooms and live with my son.
And in other families, the conditions are much worse, on the second floor in general the ceilings are slightly more than one and a half meters high.
In contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant and hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says:
We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live: my husband and daughter and granddaughter.
I have been here since birth, there has never been another living space, - Lyudmila circles the room with her eyes: mezzanines, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them there is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But the ceiling regularly flows: the plumbing system is nowhere to be found.
Lyudmila talks about her apartment casually and surprisingly at the same time, as an Italian whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, reduces to one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The plumbing was done about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then we made a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former pantry.
We live exactly where Demidov and his family lived, servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
The Real Estate Center of Ufa says that privatization does not matter.
We still get only one-bedroom apartment, we can not claim for more.
Already four months ago they promised to resettle us, but it did not go beyond the promises.
I’m not used to complaining, and I won’t.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother and grandfather, mom and dad, me with my husband and my daughter and granddaughter.
Everything has happened in that time.
For example, large rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they are a meter thick!
They say the solution was kneaded on the eggs, which is why it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thanks Demidov!
Maybe that's why nobody's been killed by a collapsed ceiling or a pile.
Only the building is still slowly dying in front of our eyes: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors repeatedly collapsed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, like a well.
They say that it is - under our room a secret creek and a path to the White River, which was specially made by the old believers who once lived here, so that you could hide from danger, in case of what.
They were pursued.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begging to let him start excavation in the apartment.
And then he persuaded them to give them a living space in exchange for his odnushka on October Avenue.
Lyudmila historian refused:
Where are the four of us in the same room?
And here at least a tiny hope is that they will give housing more spacious.
If we'd agreed to the exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
The old man’s family won nothing.
Lyudmila’s biggest dream was to be resettled, and her daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families allocated a two-room apartment instead of not the most majestic ruins, in which two generations now live.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakov from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There in two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, lives her large family.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see what the conditions are.
The plaster falls off in pieces, like window frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the tap is only cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can be sure that the most fortunate spouses of Lavrentiev from apartment number 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.
You're right, there are lots of places.
Room in 75 squares, registered three people.
We live in the rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around cracks at the seams, falls apart, falls apart.
The neighbors must have told me!
The most torment we have with the floors: the wooden boards rotted, the earth literally went from under our feet.
I have set up supports, wedges; there is nothing in the hall yet, and in the other room we walk as on a swing, everything is so shaky.
About the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.
He treats the gold miner as his own, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uziansky factories built houses, cast guns and bells, held Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of the ancestor, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the 20th century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guard booths, subsequently demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean our house too, but something stopped them.
History repeats itself in 2014: once again attracted new housing.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, went around the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartments is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We no longer believe in all of this...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The tenants did not accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, issued a piece of paper without a signature and seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of tenants."
I even had the feeling that our house has long been gone in terms of the city, because at first it was number 57, then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it was demolished in the '70s.
"Russian Planet" appealed to the head of the information and analytical sector of the Ufa Land Resources Administration Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of resettlement of old housing.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 70s, but I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, which are of architectural value, is being successfully implemented.
Residents will soon be relocated to new apartments.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the Demidov House will be carried out by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy, the architectural Biennale is held, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazan street will be restored, - said the official.
The houses will have a proper appearance, corresponding to what they were before, three centuries ago.
The house of Demidov will most likely become a museum open to all.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street a pedestrian street on weekends.
On weekdays, unfortunately, will not work, too much traffic in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to displace people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorye because of the storm began a forest fire
The dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting District Forestry in the Pozharsky District of the Primorsky Territory.
At the site of the fire, the grouping of forces and means is being increased.
According to the management of the KGSBU "Primorskaya Air Base", the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy head of the air base:
The fire, which occurred in an inaccessible area, was detected by an observer pilot from the An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Burning wood debris on an old burner.
The strong cloggedness of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of landing paratroopers-fire sites create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
A Mi-8 helicopter is required.
The delivery of forces available to the airbase by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the discovery of the fire, four paratrooper firefighters were promptly landed at the extinguishing site.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and firefighting equipment.
In the area of lunch in the area of the village Hunting helicopter delivered additionally 3 paratroopers-firefighters.
As soon as the landing site for the helicopter in the area of the fire is ready, the specialists will be transferred to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the administration of the Primorsky Territory.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programs on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "many" treatments, moreover, Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move it!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to a pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such a smiling guy in the corner who read the paper for most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions had improved since his father’s time, he was able to take a look at what his life must have been like.
Now there is a little better, but it is dark, smokey, depths of labyrinths of hell with flashes of fire and smoke and a lot of soot.
My dad went into the bathtub and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing to himself because he wanted to wash away from the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn our livelihood, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It wasn’t until Mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why shouldn't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They are still great friends with French, whom he was married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got very, very well and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitens classes, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career path is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has completely immersed himself in theater.
This was followed by "The Comedy of Mistakes" and then "The Fences" by August Wilson.
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parodying on stage and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies: "For quite a long time I was the only black parody/comedian on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Menstrual Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blacked their faces", Henry found himself performing there for five years.
My family didn’t like it very much.
I kind of wish it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, deplorable position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was “an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years” was also “a grotesque parody of black people.”
Introducing characters who both mocked and sung black culture in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s it was known as, among other things, Chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series "Chef!".
Commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in films took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're dragging time or slowly turning aside."
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 titled "What's Good About..."
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I can’t say that I was really taught this in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with pantyhose and cabbage at the bottom.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't say that until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words aloud, and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for a documentary, and he was hooked.
I had a feeling I could do it.
It's like my head was straightened out.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we staged it.
And she was successful.
It seemed that they were waiting for a catastrophe, and it did not happen.
Soon after, we started The Comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I'm in the National Theatre and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a time when I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“A quiet voice inside me said, ‘You’ll have to work for 10 minutes while they’re fixing the computer.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You're in a play, stay in a role."
Henry in "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for "Fences" was difficult.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing: "This is what you need to do."
He says it, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'm sticking to it.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the thinking of a comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he begins, then ends parody.
I just decided not to work in the stand-up, because this thing of getting instant rewards from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you keep trying, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at Apollo Live when I want to, but mostly I don't get the pleasure I used to.
I'm wondering if he'll ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of the road – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give it up.
So this is his new incarnation?
Yeah, I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify ‘invisible workers’
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all civil servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government’s payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to reduce corruption in government structures since he came to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month is lost through payments to invisible workers and other financial misconduct.
The government suspects that wages continue to flow into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi, reports.
All civil servants must appear within the next two weeks at the identification centers to ensure that their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without good reason will be deleted from the payroll, it said.
"This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of the government - hence, it will put an end to the problem of 'invisible workers,'" said Anne Vaiguru, secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Structured Power.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with the “conspiracy” against the government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local news agencies reported.
Police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption detection activities last December, which were aimed at screening government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and tapping the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) defined their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told expectant journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony did not take place in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, the huge unified Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksandr Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their later lives.
The first day of study is traditionally celebrated by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader that she needs
It is followed by a trail of glory from the world of banking, media management and the inner circles of the Tory party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a senior position at the parent company Pearson's was taken by a male colleague in a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are close to <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former advisor to Tory.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's job a poisoned bowl.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two directions: inward as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outward as the voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly, which requires complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk coming, trampling down and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he would deprive himself of his job in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn’t be that difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size – after reviewing its authority, finances, and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiation over the cost of the license poses a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in what is definitely the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: she states that the results of her work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them just 40p a day.
What’s more, it’s clear that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today versus 31 percent 10 years ago.
The patterns of viewing and using the BBC have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman -- I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone outside
A tweet from Texas Gov. Rick Perry's confirmed account on Sunday night contained an insulting image of a Democratic district attorney who is at the center of criminal prosecutions for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which this recording was disavowed.
I just posted a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I removed it," a later post said.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to the messages with a request to comment.
Although the recordings were uploaded from Perry’s verified account, it was unclear who was actually doing the posting on that tape.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering caricature of District Attorney Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The tweet reads, "I don't always drive intoxicated, three times the blood alcohol limit, but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry of telling me about it."
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Department did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who had been appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the allegations a political ploy.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, saying the law, which is used to prosecute a governor who has been in office for the longest time in Texas’ history, would be vague, contrary to the constitution.
Perry halted $7.5 million in state funding to the State Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County and is prosecuting public sector corruption in Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto sparked an official complaint from a public control group with left-wing views.
The tape of Perry’s confirmed account is often updated – and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at a party congress in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might be out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley Says Real Estate Market Is Back to 'Normal'
One of London’s most famous developers warned that the property market in southeast England has “returned” to normal levels of activity.
Houses in the capital have been subject to high demand and rapidly rising prices, with fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgeley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013,” adding that this provided a “stable working environment.”
The London real estate market thrived during the downturn as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent in the past year alone, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly exceeding the average of 6.7 percent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for Berkeley private, affordable and student schemes rose by about a fifth last year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London’s real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been stalled by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “mansion tax” ahead of next May’s general election.
LONDON (Reuters) - London-based real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that April’s mortgage market reform, which imposed tighter loan terms, would also lead to a slowdown in market growth for both property purchases and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its forecast for London real estate price growth for 2015 to 3%, based on the fact that the sentiment of real estate prices has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes fell by a quarter from the previous year in London’s most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital turned out to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales by more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgeley added: “Demand for the right product with a good design and a better location remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the term remained.”
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April — almost a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent from the previous year to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, revenue by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Speaking ahead of the company’s annual meeting on Monday, Mr. Pidgeley said Berkeley’s expected revenue for this year would match current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, the profit for the whole year before taxes is expected to be <0xC2><0xA3> 450 million.
Berkeley's shares held at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of nude Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th annual Academy Awards.
Photos of nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who assures that he has a "catalogue" of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A spokesperson for the star of the Hunger Games confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are real, and condemned the hacker for “sudden invasion of personal space”.
Law enforcement has been contacted, and they will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo-sharing site, were allegedly obtained due to the lack of Apple's iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It’s unclear how many of these photos are genuine, though “Scott Pilgrim vs. All” star Winstead on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who are looking at the photos my husband and I took a few years ago when we were at home, I hope you are proud of yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria Winner" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of me naked FALSE, people.
Let me put a stop to this in the bud.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that pop star Ariana Grande’s spokesman denied that the photos she allegedly appears to be genuine.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J", which aroused the praise of critics
They dissolved, best said, they gradually fell apart, like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only occasionally did the woman tell him that he was too serious, difficult to communicate, tense, closed and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw irritability in himself.
He was as stingy as a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this thorn was a small romance, from which he expected more than usual, getting rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Aileen Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beauty with shabby hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, which Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in a raw, but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one has lived in the house for years.
Pipes flowed, spiders sat motionless in the baths, slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was overgrown with weeds, like giant cabbages.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both frightening and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the 2014 Booker Prize long list.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eilene sat, holding hands, in broken deckchairs among the tall grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; both of them were distracted by the cheap console that provided the country with the soothing music and the soothing news that his father had given him, the soothing news that he had given him, the soothing news that he had given him.
Your legs are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console were no longer lost.
They weren't banned -- nothing was actually banned -- they just didn't lose any more.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic".
The public taste did what orders and precepts would never have done, and just as among books people chose memoirs of rich men raised in poverty, cookbooks and romance novels, they chose ballads from all the music.
Intrigued by this day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and a rude comic voice to sing the big legs of Eilene.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her, mechanically sticking two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it flew off his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with a "J" and forget to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t very fun now.
He knew that was what was expected of him, that's all.
I had to explain to him what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz was also not played, although it was not explicitly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
With wit the same.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was wit expressed with the help of music.
Although he reached the age of 10, never having heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Cavern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was obedient, and this meant that each segment of society agreed with the principle of gratitude — the gratitude of those saved by fate — with the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean descent in temperament and physical characteristics were well suited to the field of entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
Indians, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, took care that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish Diaspora was engaged in plumbing; what was left of the Greek, beat the plates.
The people of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not leave the country quickly, when WHAT HAPPENED, IF THERE WAS ANYTHING, in fear that they would be accused of igniting the flames, in fear, in fact, that the flames would consume them without the following, and they opened restaurants.
Each according to ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, it was hard for Eilene to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Cavern said.
Unless, perhaps, for people who have large legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of security.
Not a single word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant cabbage-like leaves.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn’t want to press two fingers to his lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, closing Keverna's view.
In the whole world there was nothing but a mound of her blue-black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, holding her own opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big feet?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, “I love you,” but it was too early.
"I like you precisely because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I have such a perversion.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often put him in awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked that soothing charm that could soften the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Cavern, wanted to, too.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and got up from the deckchair, flipping over the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
Wine from elderberry, so intoxication could not justify it.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you precisely because you have a dumb head," she said.
Although I don't like you.
He felt sorry for her both because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she fought him back.
Did she think he would hit her?
She had not spoken to him about living in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that in the basics she resembled the local archipelago.
The same huge icy ocean fell on both of them.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT HAPPENED, if anything, than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, roamed in rage from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to refuse them or tease them.
Stupid head?
They would have shown her a dumb fist if she hadn't been careful!
First kissed – a kiss has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that gave the console – first kiss her and then hit her.
Unnecessary clarification, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons showed the corps that he had to leave.
He got up from the chair like an old man.
She herself felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the upper window she watched him leave, her companion being a man who had borne the burden himself.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt an injection of compassion for him and the men in general, although some of them raised their hands on her.
The man who turned away from her, with his back bent, embarrassed, battered, all the ability to fight had left him - why did she think she knew it so well, if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would have seen such a thing?
Again, Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Ofnau, an unofficial public sentiment monitoring service, had prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to be reduced if it did not stop altogether, taking into account the means and forces that were needed.
“A lot has been done, and much is being done,” she wrote, “to soften the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow crevices of the area, where, despite the spires of churches hovering over the fences, the gentle breath of human kindness was seldom felt.
However, some qualities seem to be unstoppable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions that it generates.
The population sheds tears over the sentimental ballads, even swallows stories of overcame obstacles and declares its fierce faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence that the laborers are being born on the ground, the new and evil.
“You have the annoying habit of writing too much,” her supervisor said after reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer,” said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
“I ask,” finally said Luther Rabinowitz, “not because I am against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are the servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as the ones you showed me.
Obviously, you yourself are biased against the church, and what you call “evil” and “rough” would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and energeticness.
To continue to offer what happened, if it happened at all, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, pink like flamenco, the LED letters echoed the advice that Ofnau had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word of a song is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand what you mean,” replied Esme Nussbaum quietly as she made sure her supervisor had finished speaking, “and I don’t want to say anything other than that we haven’t been cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
What worries me is that if we’re not ready, we’ll find ourselves repeating the mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF EVERYTHING HAPPENED.
Only this time we will throw our anger and distrust not on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected his fingertips into a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean infinite patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “by calling the actions that our grandfathers did or didn’t do “mistakes.”
You go too far and when you talk about the fact that they have thrown their “anger” and “distrust” on “others”.
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that by understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them”.
There was no “us” and there was no “other.”
It was a time of disarray, that's all we know.
"For which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme ventured to insert, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it is good or bad, what is done is done.
It was then.
There is nothing more to say, we agree.
And how not to blame anyone, do not justify, if it was appropriate or if it was possible to correct something.
But why the past, if not in order to learn -
The past exists to make us forget it.
If I may add one word to this --
Luther Rabinowitz's pyramid collapsed.
"I'll look at your report," he said, releasing her.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove out onto the sidewalk, as passers-by described, “in anger.”
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho Army Says Coup Was Not Planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Lesotho’s army denied the plot to overthrow the government, saying it had acted against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying the country’s army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he received a threat of assassination.
An army spokesman, Major Ntlele Ntoi, said there was no coup, but that the army was responding to a threat from “political fanatics” whom police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command has taken action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties that were willing to cause chaos,” he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Moniel said the army’s actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed to seize power by force, by all accounts, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces so far have the main signs of a coup,” he said.
Lesotho's army said the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing runs the government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane said he believes he is being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements within his combined Government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on lease at Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours to undergo a medical examination.
In the past season, he went on the field with the London club only three times.
Recall that earlier Milan rented from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at lowest level in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the Markit Business Activity Index (PMI) of the euro area manufacturing sector fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and businesses have suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The values came before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank on how to cope with a halt to the recovery of the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the inhibitory effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany’s manufacturing sector, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a real concern, as is Italy’s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
"Signs that the growth momentum has waned in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence," Dobson said.
A slowdown in industry is likely to fuel analysts awaiting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August survey of the Eurozone’s manufacturing sector business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “The eurozone producers obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – especially those related to Russia/Ukraine – add to the uncertainty of the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit businesses — and especially consumer confidence — and is likely leading to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it was “increasingly like” that the ECB would eventually have to carry out some sort of quantitative easing “although we suspect it will be limited.”
Residents of Mariupol will put up a human chain against the militias
In Mariupol until last week everything was calm - no one rushed to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are waiting with horror for the arrival of the “militia”.
According to political analysts, separatists are breaking through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would protect them, but its forces were slightly against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and they were going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a living chain, singing the national anthem of Ukraine.
They will do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and food, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closing, banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten Years of Hell for Beslan Survivors: Ten Years from the Horrible Occupation of the School as the Children Who Were in It Still Suffer
A decade ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day test that shook the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the atrocity at the school.
Exactly ten years after the horrific seizure of Beslan school that killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of the disaster warned yesterday evening of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed like an extreme degree of evil possible.
The tragedy united East and West in disgust, which miraculously then turned into action and hope for the future in the face of severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death during the atrocities at the school.
We found amazing young people who faced adversity, although the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now afflicting Ukraine, in which children like them are being killed, will now end.
The girl in the photo trying to climb back into the shooting gym
It is captured in a picture of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one of the underwear tried to climb back into the shooting gym after the explosion of a mine.
In confusion, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but in fact they survived.
“The woman told me to run, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
There are a few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that the doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t break it,” she says with a challenge.
“It happened to me and it cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzer Gapoeva, was murdered there.
We used to play together when we were little and dreamed that we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I’ve finished my studies and started working.
I'll think about family later.
She says the rapture stays with her, though the memories fade a little bit every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see a picture of me climbing through a school window on the Internet, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, believing that his mother is dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at age 7) and he survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, “My mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.”
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed the baby by the hand and ran through the hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with injuries to her feet, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, “I was crying with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now the defunct News of the World), where he was honored as Child Protector by the Barnardo's Foundation by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,” he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that he faints in my memory.
I remember immediately after that I threw away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted and a trip in an open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief he and his friends have endured.
That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who volunteered at the convent last week.
I really want to help.
I want to serve in the police force someday and I hope to be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence immediately after the capture, there were simply no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to "Sherry Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I would like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting them with his water pistol, and they ran and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I still think that this world hasn’t gotten better in these 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it’s so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not aggressive and not angry.
He is not seeking revenge, for example, he is not obsessed with this past nightmare.
I know he doesn’t like to remember him, but they’re very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it – I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us, for hours.
He didn’t sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damiru is now 17, he is above me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get on my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me, with body parts lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember shouting to him, ‘Damir, run, run,’ but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard it and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking photo after the capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and on the right Georgy today
His bloodied face had a trace of fear as he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the chief medical officer, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only George managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise.
The photo of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right)
I remember that George so wanted to go to school that day that he said that he wanted to hug the teacher.
I only found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of a weeping George in San Marino.
George does not like to look at this photo, and it is hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, “It’s important that this never happens again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, because how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
We need decades to forget it a little bit.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had nightmares because of the seizure, but now it's better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was terrified every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a cardiothoracic surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn’t allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it will not happen.
Georgiy Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite being at the feet of a terrorist-killer
Unbelievable: George Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist-killer during the capture, but still he managed to survive
During the seizure, he was photographed in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
It is a miracle that he was not killed.
“It seems to us that it was yesterday,” says Georgiy, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer in the FSB, but could not because of the damage that was caused to his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I’m older now, and they say that kids are easy to deal with bad things – I have to say that’s not true.
“I worked with psychologists in 2006 and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the following year, was the first and last time I walked into this gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don’t ask me to show where I sat in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgi Farniev today with a photo of himself in the hospital after the seizure
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they’ve never asked me about school.
As far as my physical condition is concerned, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that has been damaged, but I’m walking normally now.
But still health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to a veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals, from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not something that children need to know, and certainly not something that they need to go through.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to commemorate it.
I don’t think George will go.
For him, she has to be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan, the imprint is on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can’t do sports.
I would say that he has overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This horrific experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the seizure, and that only intensifies my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we are at war now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If only all the rebels could be captured and thrown away, as far away as possible.
Alena Tskaeva, 10 years old
A baby who was moved to a safe place by a special forces fighter
Rescued: Alyona Tskaev is carried to a safe place by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now she is ten (right), and she does not remember at all about the monstrous crime
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when little Alyona was carried in her arms from the captured school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahar in the gymnasium of the school.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alena's mother and sister died in a deadly carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and they have a little daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, does not remember anything about the capture and blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, say neighbors.
"They are a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both wonderful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund, said that he looks forward to being able to go on the pitch again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy to play for Borussia again," Kagawa told Bild.
I feel very good.
It is full of positive emotions and I look forward to being able to go on the field again in the form of Borussia Dortmund.
Kagawa transferred from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to gain a foothold in the English club, having spent only 38 matches in the English Championship in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 assists.
Man charged with assaulting girl at Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man will appear before the court on charges of assaulting a three-year-old girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at the Pittenwine crossing in East Newk.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and hit the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78, of Anstruther, denied his guilt in Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the King's lawyer, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not be in Vladivostok
Duty Free store of Vladivostok airport posted a sign prohibiting a number of world political leaders from shopping in this store.
Do not get them perfume, vodka and cognac.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, the Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known comrades will not be able to get vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
I put a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama was banned from appearing in an even less accessible by the kind of service institution - Dietary canteens of the Moscow State University, as reported by the website of catering institutions.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a dietary canteen in Russia is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem terribly witty to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the context of the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to arrange the production of cheese varieties that are in demand among buyers.
The council was given during a visit to the company "Yugptizeprom" of the company "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also advised restaurateurs to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports was introduced in Russia from August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is satisfied with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result, given the lack of focused preparation for the competition.
Our athletes have performed at their own level," Maslakov said.
The third place is confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
Keep in mind that we weren’t prepared for this competition.
The season is over and we have not compelled our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become second in this tournament, but this season we have renewed the national team.
The French, on the contrary, put on a combat-ready team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which has been publicly announced many times.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians performed at such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were an order of magnitude lower than in the same "Diamond League".
The season is over.
Of course, athletes are no longer so important the result, especially in team level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it came to absurdity when at 1500 m men were so fond of the tactical tricks of running that they showed a result below the average level of women's races.
4 tips on how to achieve better quality underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or shoot a video underwater, you have a number of options of equipment in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof soap, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a few cameras, all for about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules you need to follow in order to get the best results.
Check your equipment again.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you’ll be shooting.
Some cameras have shooting modes or object type that optimize exposure to darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our customer guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots - because many of them will not work.
The "soap" has LCDs that will help you compose the pictures, while the action cameras usually do not have them.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the layout of the frame will be a random process.
So make a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that shoots multiple frames with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly the deeper you dive under water.
If possible, stay near the surface when you shoot in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more color in photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Swim closer to the targets.
This is a great tip for shooting on land, but it’s even more important underwater due to darkened light conditions.
This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to get close to the subjects of the shooting if you want to fill the frame.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in free wrestling Bilal Machov can go into the Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was announced by the head coach of the national team of Dagestan on free wrestling Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the athlete at the world championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Makhov is at the gathering of the team of "classics", - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Sajid Sajidov.
In general, Bilal performed in both styles for juniors.
At the 2005 World Junior Championships, he became the winner of the Volleyball Tournament and the third prize winner in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on free wrestling.
It has long been rumored that a new stage of his career our heavyweight will spend in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I will say more: Makhov can perform at the world championships in Tashkent - if he wins the guess.
But the decisive word is always behind the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose personality power could shake everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
Advising anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to delivering patients from both the suffering of the disease and the torment of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson understood that as long as doctors are passionate about diagnoses and diseases, those who are being treated are mainly concerned about something completely different - pain.
Once in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel like I used to,” he wrote last May.
It was hard to find strength in myself.
Fighting flu-like symptoms, he found himself annoyed with his wife, Juliet.
“I want things to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusually upset.
There was something wrong.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of the chest.
Just two weeks earlier, he had skied in the French Alps.
X-ray results are here.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lung shell.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But with mesothelioma, it's different.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a “miracle,” but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that we can ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was in use, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But this calmness is wrong.
The UK is currently at the height of the mesothelioma epidemic.
More people are dying of mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from car accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected number of future deaths in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), it usually takes decades to develop mesothelioma.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of the specialties of industrial construction.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, planted in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of wealth, profession or age.
Bastions of choice, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, turned out to be no salvation.
The Parliament building is permeated with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It seems there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years on an internship,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and loaders - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who have been interns at Guy’s Hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years,” he said in a 2010 letter, “I’m the only one left alive.”
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
It's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pitot, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is supposed to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t know they’re going to die that way.

A quick review of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they inadvertently exposed Janice Ellen to asbestos.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years old.
“Before it happened,” she says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn’t imagine that it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They derive their name from the word “asbestos”, which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in brake pads of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (croquidolite).
The UK was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are strong, albeit indirect, grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK].”

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pitot’s work suggests her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a patient study that suggests that "a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, was most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."
Much of this impact, he says, is due to the “usual use and impact of the weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, demonstrates how people, even in the very center of government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind the premises of parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be driven by something as harmless as “strong airflows.”
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Parliamentary Maintenance Directorate insisted that Westminster Palace had received a “clean sanitary certificate,” it now acknowledged that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion needed to rebuild Parliament by improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of parliament might not be able to sit at the QE conference center.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed according to different rules.”
It is impossible to know whether this management error will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked at a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he was struck by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of an operation late at night.
Suddenly, I started to get feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt awful.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from the pleura, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn’t go to work for a month.
Confused doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and send it for tests.
And yet his condition remained without diagnosis.
Gradually his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he exercised and breathed heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to the hospital with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and the doctor who consulted him showed his CT and X-ray results to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between his chest and lung.
I'm optimistic.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came a week between Christmas and New Year: “I was told it was mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott plunged into meetings with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was quite often asbestos thermal insulation on pipes," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people in atypical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients are unlikely to be harmed.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were a place where, in theory, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands
It’s not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries, and town halls because of its amazing insulation and fire-retardant characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in class.
Across the country, in countless chemistry classes, students installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
Websites have been launched to highlight the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or shed roofs tended to contain asbestos.
“This is an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful with the garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
“It takes a lot of time to realize that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to go and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
As a countless number of patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information that needed to be received.
“It was hard to understand,” he says.
I asked my doctor, “How much time do I have?”
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not going to celebrate Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we sustain life—the act of breathing itself—that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lung sheath.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from inhaling needle fibers of asbestos," Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy's hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he had been exposed to asbestos that is now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
The Treasurer knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely exposed while interns at the hospital.
When the asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treasure says, “Breathing pushes them to the periphery where the shell is located.
This is an invasive process from the very beginning.
Conventional treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
Treasurer disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut out the pleura," he says.
You can't walk around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer “doesn’t respond very well to chemotherapy,” which “works,” but doesn’t cure.
“Occasionally, there are patients who live a long time,” Treasurer says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, was transformed into a support and counseling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
“He was very positive,” says Abbott.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and is still very energetic.
Initially, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would extend his life by only a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "has managed to give everything a slightly more positive color."
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Lange-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need directions, I just called them and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to get referral and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment finally proves inevitably ineffective, many sufferers face another financial cause for concern – about the future of the families they leave behind.
Then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
That’s when they talked about the unfairness of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-cost settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not unequivocally prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After an investigation into his death, a spokesman for Gaia Hospital confirmed, however, that “the asbestos in the basement rooms in question was removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, linking deadly contact with asbestos to one company or workplace – usually decades later – has proven to be a major challenge for patients with mesothelioma requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owners or closed down.
The insurance records may have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that time is on their side, which the plaintiffs certainly do not have.
In response, serious new legislation came out this year that makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the law, a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund funded by the insurance industry has been created for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but have no one to sue.
In such cases, the patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in a normal case for compensation - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million represents a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal written by insurers for insurers,” he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time lapse had not intervened and mesothelioma patients had been able to track down the companies and file the lawsuit as usual.
Even Mike Penning, former Secretary of Labor and Pensions, admitted that the law was “imperfect.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven people dying every day, quick action was necessary.
“People are suffering so much and they need help today,” Penning said during the second reading of the mesothelioma bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Lange-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazdunsky boasts as much as 40 percent of patients surviving in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
“It’s certainly one of the most important things,” Abbott says.
You see this in patients all the time.
There is a force that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things — about finances when I die, for example, or about showing your wife how the boiler timer works.
When you get bad news, you get sad.
You have to look ahead.
As Ellie’s father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for a parent,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means I would not live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimpse of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it (even, in the end, for Stephen Jay Gould) a gloomy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan puts it, “Mesothelioma is not a life-threatening disease.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
China’s parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
The move is likely to trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People’s Congress, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t deceive our expectations, but it still makes us angry,” said Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
It is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said allowing a nationwide nomination for Hong Kong’s leader would be too “chaotic”.
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to elect a head of government by voting, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to direct voting; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nominating commission tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision came after the summer, when some of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong over the years took place.
Behind much of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy campaign is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district if Beijing does not guarantee genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong’s government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement was moving into a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise in the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with government agencies.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement was "considering the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
It is with great regret that we announce that all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted so far and that the capture of the central region will undoubtedly take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s statement for several days, and security measures at the government headquarters were tightened on Sunday, with police and barricades involved.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong’s values of democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put at risk Hong Kong’s business lifeblood.
"The protest they are talking about could lead to great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long," said lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long been critical of the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This is a view that is harmful to investment.
Chinese state media have also been reporting in recent days that Hong Kong’s democratic activists have been portrayed as saboteurs directed by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on the right to vote, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
American culture of graduation balls reaches university life: first-year students were asked to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK’s first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said the service had thought about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year’s students get to the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesperson said that since the service has just been launched, orders have not yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks."
The company also said that despite the fact that students face the need to pay for tuition <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Today’s students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is just what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as being detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS’s vice president of higher education, said: “This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who start college this month face a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep up with the rapidly growing costs of basic needs before they can even begin to think about taking out thousands of pounds for something like a mere arrival at a dorm.
Feminists raise the question of race and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
They raise their hands, chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot” while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, related to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists who left comments placed gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Midwest and attracted nationwide attention, Perez saw responses from white women who concentrated 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as "Feminism is not just about oppression of women" and "Thinking about Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis that we are facing, and because [the Ferguson situation] is so racially driven, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at Ohio State University, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems that black American women face every day, but which are not perceived as "female problems" in the cultural sphere.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell says.
When I write something about how people of color are being attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality issues in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly divide these issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now integrate race and gender issues into the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason for this was almost always the rape of a white woman.
A white woman was needed to corroborate the story to justify the lynching.
From Hatter’s point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would only be effective for one of the groups: women or blacks.
“They decided to put all the eggs in a basket of women’s voting rights, and black voting rights should have come later,” Hattery said.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Southern Women’s Association for the Prevention of Lynchings.
The group emerged almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise of white feminists to the issues raised by the Ferguson situation—police behavior, racial discrimination—reflects a time when white feminists had to catch up with problems that black women have dealt with for generations.
“Would it be great if activists who have this [traditional feminist] ideology took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?”
Second-wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
Famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took advantage of Facebook two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown and published a sharp article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans take more part in the protests over racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger in the body – and views on racial issues that differ significantly in public surveys – will be at the forefront of change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem vouches for a more intersecting feminism that includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America still amaze some.
American Institute of Entrepreneurship researcher Christine Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contradict the criticism she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, “Watch My Brother” to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem pushing the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform came to the surface again – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the issue as important to women, she just needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued [to male immigrants], the women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories are resonating with women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich house "with a pig" for sale
The photo of the house, put up for sale in Suffolk, was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it depicted a large pig resting in the living room.
Put up for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, a detached one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with its head resting on the sofa.
Real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
“However, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been removed,” a company spokeswoman said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-bedroom house".
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still stored in advertising materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of the US Open lost to Karolin Wozniacki, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, Vasily Osipov reports from New York.
How do you evaluate your overall results at the Grand Slam tournaments this year?
Of course, I am glad that we managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially in the finals of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn’t even get to the quarterfinals.
What are your goals for the rest of the season?
“After the offensive defeat, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I have a lot to work on and I will do everything I can to finish the year with dignity.
The Asian tournament series starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolay Valuev proposed to give bonuses for the implementation of GTO norms when entering universities.
According to him, in general, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the standards for pulling, running and other exercises.
Recall that 12 subjects of Russia will begin to implement the norms of GTO on their territory from September 1.
I also offered students who passed the GTO, to give bonuses when entering universities, - said Valuev.
For example, they can add a few points to the exam.
There are also suggestions to give extra leave to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey in South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
The lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search is underway for a new millionaire southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home nearly $1.1 million from a Saturday night lottery draw.
A newsstand in Harvey brings gold to the main prize draw for the second time in five years, last winning $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still needs to declare himself.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a win could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the top prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state’s players.
Last week, the Canning Vale player became one of five millionaires in August, following a huge $7.5 million win from the Belmont pair just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and reported that the win gave them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire raises the number of winners of the top prize in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total win of $85 million.
The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will bring to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at a round table held by "Vedomosti" at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan was drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gas-powered vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy has "Vedomosti") is designed for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport should be developed and how to encourage the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of preferential lending and leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the price of cars, stimulating localization and creating service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend the regulations to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 so that they also encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of giving it an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will add criteria to the list of indicators for evaluating the performance of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The electric car market in Russia is only forming - in 2013 about 100 electric cars were sold in the whole country.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric cars was zeroed, so sales will be about 500 pieces, predicts the chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrey Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric cars to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Nicolas Remiz, Renault’s Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia.
The majority of other manufacturers of electric vehicles took a wait-and-see attitude towards Russia.
There are developments of electric cars and Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "", but the production is meager.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM-holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of "AvtoVAZ" for engineering Sergey Amanov, without state support breakthrough in this segment will not be.
The development of the Russian market of electric cars in addition to the high cost of cars (those electric cars sold in Russia, on average, twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the underdevelopment of the charging infrastructure (refueling - units), sighs the General Director of "Autostat" Sergey Tselikov.
Due to the high cost and low cost reduction rates, electric vehicles in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of "Autorev" Mikhail Podorohansky, Tselikov agrees with him.
Automakers, on the other hand, say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, the main thing is to inspire confidence in consumers that "electromobility" is real; this will, in particular, be facilitated by the emergence of more and more new charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, about 80 more will appear soon.
Negotiations on the construction of a gas station network are also underway with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofiin, director of the Rossety Department, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build refueling stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, does not have the right to sell electricity, and the possibility of doing so is being worked out in relation to charging electric vehicles.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric car market in Russia is the zeroing of customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension and expansion of the preferential list is being worked out.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental one (the idea is discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the tax reduction led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, we also need incentive measures for car owners, for example, free parking in the city center (as already done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric cars on designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
A single-engine Piper PA-46 aircraft crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it died, reports ITAR-TASS.
Survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the city of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are being determined.
In the Donetsk region deal with the captured militants of the battalion "Donbass".
The criminals were surrounded by Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces died under fire.
The survivors say that if they knew what the situation really is in southeastern Ukraine, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
The punishers from the battalion "Donbass" remained alive after the "meat grinder", in which they fell under Ilovaisk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the militants spent several days, effectively abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters reported that it was possible to get out of the "ring" along the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally after a couple of minutes, shells and bullets hoisted from all sides.
"Judging by the information that I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the acting deputy commander of the battalion, who has the call sign "Lermontov".
And when we descended into the lowland between Mnogopol and Chervonoselsky, crossfire began with anti-tank guided missiles, grenade launchers, 30-mm BMD automatic guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three cars in the back, and there were only two cars left.
The officer with the call sign "Lermontov" says: almost immediately killed at least 60 people, dozens were wounded, many died afterwards.
The survivors are now receiving medical care from those they have come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to certain death.
They have betrayed us, they say.
The column, the entire battalion, to be destroyed.
In the battalion "Donbass", like many of his comrades, Alexey volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news told about the atrocities that allegedly committed in the south-east "separatists".
Alexis has seen a different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that mortar shelling was underway, that it was most likely the Ukrainian armed forces," says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaisk, they said that we were in a ring.
I have already arranged with the commander, the report has already written about leaving.
We were immediately taken from Zurahovo to Ilovaisk.
According to the prisoners, in the "boiler" near Ilovaisk stuck man 300-350.
Now some survivors admit that if they could turn back time, they would never join the punitive battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DPR security forces.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
In the region established a headquarters to limit the prices of products
In the Krasnoyarsk Territory, a headquarters has been established, which, if necessary, will limit the growth of prices for products on the region's market.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The staff consisted of members of the government of the region, representatives of the executive power and supervisory agencies.
Together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
Will Kiev “Rosneft” $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisichansky refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
“We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on the payment of compensation,” Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the Lisichansky refinery modernized by the company was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
“There were no fights, there were no ‘mining rebels’, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technological oil pumped into the pipes has disappeared,” he said.
On July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansky refinery, the oil storage tank burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichansky Refinery is the main refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was commissioned in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichansk refinery is about 7 million tons of crude oil per year.
The plant is able to produce fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as a batch of diesel fuel of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichansk refinery were suspended due to its loss-making nature.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichansky refinery along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile in the direction of the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, it happened around 10:30 a.m. local time on the side of the province of Chagando, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
As told to Interfax in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.

The Russian market on Friday, August 29, continued a rapid decline, but panic this time was not observed.
The ruble continued to go down and even updated the historical high against the dollar.
Investors are already anticipating the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
So far, however, it’s more like an artificial hysteria bloated through the media, especially Western ones.
There are not many options for imposing new sanctions on Russia.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the positions of the national currency may adjust.
"Orenburg Airlines" will sue "Ideal-tour"
"Orenburg Airlines" presented "Ideal Tour" lawsuits for a total amount of 4.7 billion rubles.
These are two cases that will be discussed in October.
Different judges will consider the cases.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.

The CEO of the airline Viktor Zyukin says about the amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
Director General of Aeroflot Vitaly Savelyev calls an even greater amount - two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
The microblogging service Twitter has changed the registration process of users to quickly engage new members in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will view a large number of recommended accounts during registration, to immediately make up their reading circle.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests indicated when registering.
In this case, Twitter automatically ticks the subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to uncheck his own hands, so as not to read those who are not interesting to him.
If previously users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, now Twitter displays a sample of one of the blogger’s popular tweets to help create an impression of a person.
This is the biggest change to the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter is actively working on the modernization of the service.
Such activity is primarily associated with the continued attempts of the service to achieve break-even.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a decline in reader activity.
At the moment, the company desperately needs more loyal consumers who, if they came once, would stay for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
Knowledge Day in Moscow will be cold and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region throughout the day will be cool and rainy, meteorologists say.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in the Moscow region - 13-18 degrees.
With cloudy weather with clarifications, rain will pass in places, the wind of the eastern quarter will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
Car recycling program resumed on September 1
On September 1 in Russia resumes the operation of the program on the recycling of cars.
Until December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov explained, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will apply to all vehicles older than six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a passenger car to 350 thousand rubles for a truck.
Earlier in Russia, a similar program of recycling cars was already in place.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is assumed not only the disposal of cars to receive a subsequent discount, but also the opportunity in the event that the car has reached the age of more than six years, to buy a new one with a discount when the old one is handed over to the "trade-in" from the dealer.
The previous federal recycling program, valid from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011, was spent more than 16 billion rubles.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (this is plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is widely known only now.
The game was inspired by events in Ferguson, where protests are taking place after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a title, will be on how information coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a citizen journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population take place.
The hero can take different pictures of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes, and the protesters - bandits, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where the ordinary person can not go.
If he covers events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a large-scale riot.
Points in the game will need to be scored using the hero’s Twitter, in which new subscribers will appear if the photos posted there are popular.
The game does not have a name yet.
The release date and the platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, posted an image showing how an event could change depending on how a photo of it was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media covered the events in Ferguson, he decided to make the game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who releases browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about events from the biography of Case himself, is dedicated to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about his relationship to homophobic parents.
Geletei drags Ukraine into continuing bloodshed
Calling to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, the Minister of defense of Ukraine Valery Geletey draws the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“Moscow, of course, drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Geletey, who announced the “completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great Patriotic War”, the losses in which will be counted “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his Facebook page, is a subject for research by specialists not in the military field," the Russian diplomats said.
They find it hard to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has already threatened several times through unofficial channels that in case of continued resistance they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
At the same time, he said that the "operation to liberate eastern Ukraine" was completed.

No, no one forced me to do that.
I have not been contacted by their agents.
And now I’m going to delete the candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice,” the blogger wrote on Twitter.
However, all the candid photos of the stars have already spread over the Web.

Tony Stewart suffers an accident when he returns to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172, putting an end to his performance.
Stewart drove his wrecked car to the garage and then walked out without talking to reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said 14 team members were upset but would now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better try and a better finish for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there.
Stewart first crashed into the wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after colliding with Kyle Bush, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
“I started today with a pretty high hope of getting to the finish line,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work out.”
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded onto a tow truck, and the team assembled and were ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during a race on a dirt track in northern New York.
He decided to come back this week and he had to win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to take part in the Pursuit.
He returned to work during an investigation into the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who stepped out onto the track to express his dissatisfaction with Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement said on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least another two weeks.
A decision on whether Stewart would be charged has not been made.
The three-time champion was met with loud shouts and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting from 12th position, Stewart was in the top 10 at the start of the race, reaching fourth position.
Then on lap 122 after the restart number Bush.
Car 18 went off course at the exit of Turn 2 and crashed into Stewart, pushing both cars against the wall.

Sobchak and Vitorgan have a cigarette breakfast with Zhvanetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV presenter did not miss to report on her Instagram.
However, one photo very surprised and very embarrassed fans of the couple.
The photo was taken by Zhvanetsky.
"At breakfast at Mikhail Mikhalych Zhvanetsky Maxim explains what Instagram is:)) #Odessa", - Ksenia Sobchak signed the photo.
There is nothing on the table besides cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter, and so on.

Prison officials of Bulgaria held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore the old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The increase in salaries is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the acting Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
Over the course of the month, officers protested symbolically against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the union of prison officials repeatedly met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, an agreement was not reached, according to the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are continuing, the head of the General Directorate for the Execution of Punishments Rosen Zhelyazkov said.
Members of the Federation of Prison Employees' Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest.
The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Prayuth (right) appointed Defense Minister Pravit Wongsuwan (left)
Thailand's military ruler and prime minister, General Prayut Chan-ocha, has announced a new cabinet in which more than a third of the posts are held by retired or generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: Ministers of Defense, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
Prayut Chan-ocha was formally confirmed as prime minister on Monday after the King of Thailand formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military, who seized power in a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a session of Parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed members of parliament.
According to Prayuth Chan-ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chynawat's government.
Prayut Chan-ocha will officially be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22.
The paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were subjected to temporary arrest.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested leading politicians of the country, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chynavat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis has its roots in 2006, when the army removed from the post of Prime Minister brother Yinglyk Shinawatra Taksin.
Both of them are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in the elections.
However, many members of the middle class and the metropolitan elite have entered the anti-government movement, which since November 2013 has virtually paralyzed the country.
Nobody said that the mussel salad would be better, I did not promise you this, the waitress from the new Palm brasserie is throwing off.
It is necessary to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain steadfast.
After all, everyone has long known: we say "Belgium" - we mean mussels, we say "musels" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurant owners like to say that the success of an establishment depends on three factors: location, location and again location.
There are places that are not so good, but even great, but some unlucky.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "Grodok" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and also a restaurant "Beaujolais" and a beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Above the ground is located only the tip of the iceberg: a bar and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here is fun, as in the nursery: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where swim mermaid girls.
Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg have long been out of date, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of bottled beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 liter) and countless bottled beer (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress amusedly presents the menu, telling that "mustards are satisfying large seeds", and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, who, for example, can predict that a meat roll with Walloon plums (280 rubles) is actually a carpaccio, cut so thinly that parchment paper in comparison with it will seem ugly thick.
You can feel at least some taste only if you rub half plates together.
Salads are even worse.
The classic Liege (260) would be the most correct to recognize a crime against the Belgian people: some wrinkled iceberg, boiled once long ago potatoes, sour Kenyan beans, woody bacon chips plus some kind of pickled onion.
You wouldn't want to meet anyone with a salad like that!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If the immature quarters of cherry tomatoes or over-roasted champignons could still close their eyes, then why do the mussels look as if they had thawed and boiled several times during their lives!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal white sea mussels here!
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not fit.
There are vegetables, and the aroma is absent, and whether there was wine, and remained a mystery.
But good relying on mussels fries with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken watershell here is not a pancake, thick to the point that depending on the mood you can decide the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice creamy soup.
The rabbit was said to be cooked in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
The situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary muffled everything.
It appeared that this rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes during his life, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, a wonderful - no, just a fine pear in a caramelized crust was attached to the rabbit's leg.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager approaching the table very informally inquired about the lunch impressions.
So we should come again.
The dollar has risen at the MICEX above 37 rubles on the news about the West's new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar calculations "tomorrow" at 10:29 MSK grew by 26.9 kopecks and was 37.02 rubles, the euro rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to data from the Moscow Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closing and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House said that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term outlook assumed this mark, - says senior analyst of "Alpari" Anna Bodrova.
Everything that is related to Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors of a troop invasion have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has been very emotional.
All talk that he was resistant to such news yesterday was crossed out.
The week, according to the forecasts of the expert, will close around these levels - 36,90 and 37,05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policy, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links in one chain.
Acceleration of inflation is also predicted: to the current prices for the autumn will be added from 5 to 10%.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will run out, and there will be some vacuum, while the networks are redirected to other suppliers.
“The dollar came to the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and came back, there is no strong hysteria,” commented the head of the department of market analysis “Opening Broker” Konstantin Bushuyev.
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The ruble, according to him, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, followed by news on Ukraine, besides, the Central Bank last week said that by the end of the year it is fully moving to a floating rate and refuses any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
Alarming times for the foreign exchange market were, I recall, when at the end of January there was an increased demand for the currency, as well as on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it is the growth of the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as increasing the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the increase in imports, says Alexei Kozlov, chief analyst of UFS IC.
The negative points can be attributed to the increase in the price of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, cause an increase in the cost of borrowing money, which in turn inhibits the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smoothes the decline in stock prices, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MICEX Index fell by 1.67% during Thursday’s bidding, while the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative size of the decrease in indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by the mass desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, gradually emotions go away, and the quotes of the ruble partially or completely restore the lost positions.
“We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar,” said Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The British woman said she had spent many years thinking she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karin Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CHMT), a group of hereditary disorders that lead to nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are presumed to have BMD, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure gait, and squeezed toes.
Patients may experience numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, which means that symptoms intensify over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and would die before she turned 30.
A mother of two, now 51, said: “I knew as a child that I couldn’t do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I could never roller skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied a lot in school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into her medical records when her doctor left the room and it said she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I put my nose where it shouldn’t be, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the worst panic possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that interval.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, “My dear, I don’t think you have this disease, because you would be in a wheelchair by now.”
I think you have something that's far less life threatening.
After several genetic examinations, she was found to have CMT.
“When he explained what SMT was, I thought I pulled out a lucky ticket,” she said.
The UK charity CMT announced a month of information about CMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The tax burden on entrepreneurs of the Washington zone increases as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and more jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country rose moderately last year as economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to the state and local treasury in fiscal 2013, 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion raised for 2012.
The tax burden on businesses by state and local level increased by 4.3 percent last year, to $671 billion, from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years when accounts declined, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes grew faster, 4.3 percent faster than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from entrepreneurial taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
The increase in tax revenues is largely driven by a return to the company’s previous real estate value, the researchers say, which raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 percent.
While a large proportion of these revenues come from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems the same thing is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up $9.6 billion from 2012 — an increase of 4.2 percent from the previous year.
However, the observed return to real estate has no similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one-fifth of the company’s tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of real estate taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a nonprofit organization that doesn’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Taxation Center.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also seems to be improving, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although trends are oriented in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three localities.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each having the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25%, while in the county it is relatively high - 9.975%.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and a generally more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina recently signed legislation to lower the corporate rate from 6.9 percent this year to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, the law could raise the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to as much as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be feeling better and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Entrepreneurial taxes paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners – the transitional structure by which most small firms are structured – in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much faster rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs in general.
The researchers say the trend and increases in business tax revenue across the country are likely to continue this year, with revenues from turnover taxes in state and local governments rising 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home World Judo Championships brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians were inferior only to the main favorite of the competition - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who performed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one comment received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian national team - on Tuesday, three medals were won at once.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg, silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the world champion of 2011 and 2013 to the Japanese Masashi Ebinuma.
Khan-Magomedov, at the quarter-final stage lost to a compatriot, won the consolation tournament and became the owner of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament category up to 52 kg also to the third stage of the podium of honor reached Natalia Kuzyutina.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the current world champion Mailinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who at this championship played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute over bronze Kuzyutina won against Ma Yinan from China, but after the tournament still admitted that the third place is not what she expected.
And again, the obstacle on the way to the Russian gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk bronze in the hoard of the national team of Russia put Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category of up to 73 kg.
In the quarter-finals, his offender was the former representative of Moldova Viktor Skovortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov played at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a pause in the competition.
As for the former Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he in this tournament reached the bronze medal.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, Ivan Remarenko, who took sports citizenship of the UAE, finished his performance in the category up to 100 kg with bronze.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifontov won in the category up to 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt due to a remark from his opponent.
On Friday, the tournament played three sets of awards, but the Russians traditionally limited one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Questions, and the Russian national team this medal was guaranteed: his rival in the consolation final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: rival Vyachova could not go to the tatami due to injury.
Men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the national team's sack by Renat Saidov, who performed in the category of over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he won a clean victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian national teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was unlucky - they did not reach the medal.
But the Russian judokas won the command silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they in a stubborn struggle with the score 2-3 gave way to the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian national team led 2-0 after a clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and Volya - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals could not cope Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
According to the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament was developed, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competition in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
“Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions,” Putin said.
To lose to the Japanese, the ancestors of judo - there is nothing embarrassing here.
But I'm sure you can win with them.
The Russian national team at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago at competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.
We are all, of course, great maximists.
I want gold medals.
But let’s remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo," summed up the results of the tournament, Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The national team of Japan was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopes, sources say.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and close surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “severe.”
The response has been broad, including numerous online support from people like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All can be kings.
The debut album of the band Royal Blood - a new hope of British rock, brought rock duets from clubs directly to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo is only a year on stage, but has already been nominated for a BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour at the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of a New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name a few months before the release received 100,000 pre-orders, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of the question, because we are not talking about the new Lana Del Rey or the next sweet voice representative of the "new R'n'B", but about the duo of bullish-looking Brits playing with the level of volume and intensity that was last fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes on the first album in connection with all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and have already fully justified.
The duo did not in vain take a name that could have been encroached on before, except for the very desperate hairy metallers, and the blood of which kings flows, as they think, in their veins, is also understandable.
We are talking, of course, first of all about the heroes of the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this enterprise so far, perhaps, too early, but something can already be said.
A dozen songs that fit in thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer’s talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some of the merits of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: for example, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum party.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to tap than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing record of the song "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
It’s not necessarily bad, on the contrary.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (more likely to be the successors of Motörhead), but have brought numerous rock duets out of the ghettos of indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously narrow.
The secret is partly in the cunning use of the bass, replacing the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only in the instruments, but also in the very approach to songwriting.
The heroes of the retro-rock zero with great difficulty were chosen outside the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance went to the fact that they recognized themselves not just epigones, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sound so powerful and brazen that this push successfully drapes some secondaryity and stubbornness of the musical material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The online store — and the video producer, and a hundred other things — is buying the Twitch video streaming service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
The news came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, selling Twitch to Google video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a general-purpose streaming service — a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly evolved into a platform where gamers streamed their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time gaming,” according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which omniscients give (mostly old) games a processing, as in "Mystery Theatre", is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of a tech company taking over a potential competitor.
It’s a secret why the deal with YouTube failed, given that it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.”
Another secret, frankly, is Twitch’s incredible success.
Snobs like me, who say they’d rather do sports than watch it, find it hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking a joystick.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you can watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them shoot without controlling the angle of view on your own can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed passes in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But if it’s not a game or humor virtuoso, it’s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon make money from this?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch rolling into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just absorb Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love to get: crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of games” and this channel doesn’t show signs of fading, even — oh — as a spectacular sport.
The 2004 attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We spoke with the surviving hostages - almost all now students, with the parents of the deceased, with the cemetery keeper - City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mothers of Beslan" Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, - says the correspondent of the "Society" department Elizaveta Antonova.
Already returning to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the President on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the “B” FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during my work on this topic was that Beslan did not seem to have had these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for anyone who has anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But we can not forget Beslan, and I hope that we coped with our task," Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographic studio of the holding Rambler & Co, which has been working for the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s tenure in power.
North Korea launches a short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, reports Renhap.
The launch took place around 10.30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, on the border between North Korea and China.
The missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, said in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Deputies proposed to expedite the entry into force of the law on personal data
In case of success of the initiative, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015.
The State Duma introduced a draft law providing for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is placed in the base of legislative activities of the lower house.
Its authors were deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parakhin ("Fair Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to more prompt and effective ensuring the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the protection of personal data and the observance of the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, the entry into force of which parliamentarians are in a hurry, obliges to store on the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians processed through the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, refine and extract personal data of Russian citizens in databases located in Russia, as well as indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of the so-called “black lists” of violating sites – an automated information system “Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects”.
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation, will have to pay for rent
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems for postponing the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own repositories of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, “from Rostelecom”, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies, which today already provide their servers.
“In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
"If the companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I do not see any problems - they will receive technological opportunities for placement," Levin said.
Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be ensured only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism for informing the user about where the recording takes place, systematizing his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose in which territory these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the withdrawal of global services and significant economic losses.
The participant of the test with a bucket of ice water dislocated the jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the bone structure of the face.
This ice water bucket test went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she shouted so loudly during a bucket of ice water that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts shouted so loudly when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw started to get stuck,” she told The Mirror.
Water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts in the Seconds Before the Accident
I tried to close my mouth, but it didn’t close, it was stuck, and then I realized that something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and they began to giggle, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to the hospital to straighten her jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The video became an online sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militias handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
In the “Army of Novorossiya” claim that they shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the enemy of violating the agreement on the ceasefire
On September 1, the militias handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 killed soldiers.
This was reported to "Interfax" by a representative of the press service of the "Army of Novorossiya".
He added that "air defense forces in the vicinity of the settlement of Mereshki shot down the Su-27 aircraft that violated the ceasefire agreements."
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions during the shelling of the Luhansk airport.
The representative of the press service noted that the militias overnight managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian air force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"Losses in enemy manpower - up to 100 people killed and wounded, surrendered 13 people," - said the representative of the headquarters.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the “people’s republics” of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, at night, the army of the DPR, according to the "Army of Novorossia", "cut off the attempt of the national guards in violation of the previously reached agreements to withdraw from the encirclement area heavy equipment".
Then the militias reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a brief battle, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 servicemen.
According to the headquarters, the total enemy losses in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk region of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of the “people’s republics” to release Ukrainian servicemen from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy hand over weapons and ammunition.
The first dozen soldiers began to leave the surrounded settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the encircled battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semen Semenchenko, on the night of Sunday from the "boiler" came another 14 people.
On his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are “captured by the 137th regiment of the 32nd division of the Russian Federation and the 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation,” where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Defense Ministry have denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in case of introduction of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the “conclusions” of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on “absolutely unproven allegations about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country,” the ministry’s website said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, succumbs to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged “dialogue between the opposing parties”, the ministry emphasizes.
Also on the website of the Ministry it is noted that now there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in the Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has unfolded, and the number of victims among the civilian population is growing.
During the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, representatives of the EU work closely with American officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate the measures imposed with each other in terms of the period of validity and the degree of severity.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy sector and the financial sector.
Also, the Australian government announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Clever Ways to Save on University Textbooks
With university textbooks costing many students more than $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who is about to move to second year, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to borrow books from seniors, offering them nominal compensation so that they could postpone their sale.
“My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature for the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a range of options to reduce those costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
Book rentals are becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to enjoy the book for a semester, and often cost significantly less than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book rentals has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in the university’s bookshops during the last spring semester were leased, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Purchase in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of Mathematical Analysis by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 at the price, but the new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the website Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Buying a used
If you don’t mind someone else’s marks or damage, second-hand textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Caseday, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of the textbook “Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising.”
The book sold for $48.
Teachers such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the “College Without Walls” at the University of Massachusetts at Emhurst, suggest that students ask their professors if they can use previous editions.
Sometimes updates are irrelevant to classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Rent a car
You should consider renting textbooks if you treat them well enough, don’t forget to return them and don’t want to keep them for yourself after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent Mathematical Analysis for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you may be issued for markings, underscores and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented, buying an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The rental of "Mathematical Analysis" on the website Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, since many classic works can now be downloaded for free, while literature in the natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Galt, 29, who is about to start studying at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using an ISBN number to find out the price of a book, as this ensures that you are looking for exactly the text you need.
Before you place an order online, says Galt, be sure to check if the book is really in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was postponed for four weeks, and he eventually paid the full price in the university bookstore.
Putin said the total inefficiency of the Fund for the development of the Far East
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective.
"15 billion rubles remain on deposits," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to expedite the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, did not approve the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main objectives for the development of the Far East.
Among them, the increase in transport accessibility of the region, the removal of infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create preconditions for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form territories of advanced development, which should become competitive in relation to the key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the President stressed.
Recall, earlier it was reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the SEZ.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" could not save the cash register
Sylvester Stallone’s “Unstoppable 3” returned less than $30 million of its $90 million budget to the US, while “The City of Sins: A Woman Worth Killing” returned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's "home video" brought in only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films such as "How to Train Your Dragon 2" are also disappointing in revenue.
The Telegraph article by Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children’s films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year ever in terms of children's films, and called "How to Train Your Dragon 2" a barely "functioning" sequel to fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience of a slightly older age, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film released in the summer to at least 2,000 copies between Memorial Day in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is similar in caliber to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of online streaming services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney movie The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what was before.
Unlike the current drop in box office fees in Hollywood, Netflix’s revenue from streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year’s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on the comic book franchise, and predicted the "crash" of Hollywood.
In light of the current recession, some commentators argue that there was some truth in his gloomy predictions.
Due to the fact that the summer of 2015 is expected to release several potential box-office hits, including "Avengers: Age of Ultron", "Mignons" and "Jurassic Park", other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer Simon Kinberg of X-Men recently called the drop in box office sales simply “cyclical,” telling the Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the most box office summer in history, and no one will worry about it.”
Food sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, the general public still prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to have a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella,” lamented Barlotti’s chef Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheeses offered to him by suppliers in exchange for Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
The Parmesan stock should last for a few more months.
What should I do?
Moving to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not let him go until now.
The meat was lying on carts just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things have changed now.
But the other day they brought me a fish from the Far East.
So she turned out to be rotten!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the person who brought this to us.
Valerio is surprised that many common things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in the wild.
A few years ago I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang in order to become soft, so that the muscles relax.
I did it all with local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get that tender meat?"
I said, it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
Five minutes walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen hangs a stop-list, which lists the missing products: French oysters, sea urchin.
Chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Most" and the bar "Arrow" Director Trigel is not so pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already replaced oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, and Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Coloured cabbage - 200 rubles!
I said, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make some money too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their shell weighs?
For the price, it turns out to be a superdelicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror stories for foreign chefs.
The standard story: "The first three months everything was fine, then the quality dropped sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.

Sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of separate economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called mainly food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and by-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
The restaurants began to cheat with suppliers: prices for products increased, we need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
This will most strongly affect expensive restaurants with a mono-cuisine of France, Italy, Spain, to which products were delivered directly from the "mother" countries.
The community had to rebuild before.
For example, in early 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, the suppliers set up supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 turned out to be much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban fry Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can be further eased.
At the same time, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu for what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergey Mironov, the owner of Restconsult.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Most" is ready for this: you will have to refuse 10-15% of dishes, another half of the menu - to recycle.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine are already beginning to replace dishes, for example, steak from marble beef - to beefstroganov, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," said Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of the East-West company.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the United States can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget chain restaurants will be easier to rearrange than the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who are able to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian went there.
Although it will be difficult to institutions Ginza Project, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace," Mironov says.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.
The owners of cafes of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European ones.
But there are also many restaurants that are practically unaffected by the sanctions.
These include institutions with the cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine," says Khatuna Kolbaya, owner of Georgian restaurant Saperavi and cafe "Vai me!".
All cheeses for us are made in Russia, the basis of many dishes is chicken fillet, we do not use exotic greens.
The restaurants of Kolbai have not yet removed a single dish from the menu.
Timur Lansky, the owner of restaurants "Caihon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions are also not embarrassing: he will have to change only lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia establishes imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe.
From the CIS, you can get cuts, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits cheaper.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes everyone knows that they are delicious, sweet.
No one speaks Spanish that way.
After the introduction of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan Olimba Artykov said that he plans to increase exports of fruit and vegetable products to Russia twice by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to the request "Money", also quite calmly react to the sanctions.
The McDonald's press service said the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80% of the network purchases products in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In "Teremka" "sanctions products" in general occupied no more than 4%.
The sanctions and the "Walker" noodles were not affected.
KFC, Burger King and Tiny Potato did not respond to Money’s request, but other market participants argue that Burger King’s localization rate is significantly lower than that of McDonald’s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern
On his hunchback
Meanwhile, restaurateurs complain that due to the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
"For products for Grabley, prices increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" - twice," - says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of meals will increase by 5-10%, Kolbaya admits.
East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
“Brazilian suppliers have raised pork prices almost twice,” complains Sergey Rak, deputy general director of Stardogs.
Chicken crust increased by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices, - says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of the revenue of the catering for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how fast: for now, most restaurateurs have stockpiled products for the next two months in the hope of waiting for the drop in purchasing prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
In the square in front of the Moscow City Hall stands a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the stage, the musicians play the waltz.
It’s a regional food festival with the fun title “There’s Time to Eat”.
"We were going to make a celebration of local food for a long time, and here we were just sanctions, we hurried, organized a festival," one of the organizers said.
Behind the scenes with musicians, Greek chef Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on cooking borsch with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, deer from Salekhard, vegetables from the Lenin Sovkhoz near Moscow, cheeses from the Italian Jay Close.
“Salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced with other salmon fish from the Far East,” says the owner of the fish shop “Your People” Philip Galkin.
We've got a roe, a cat, a sneeze, a humpback, a chavycha, a king salmon.
Yes, they are not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because it is a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it in your hand, it doesn't even move.
And you will not hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic
In the window of his tent there are shrimps with the tag "Magadan", cod, omul, muksun, mussels from Crimea, combs from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is long time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even to the United States.
The import of fish in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
The shop "Your People" has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, before the imposition of sanctions served another half a dozen restaurants, for example, "Simple Things".
Currently, Galkin has received requests from 15 more restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, - he is hot.
We tried different recipes, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation, at Galkin's tent, I'm getting a Philadelphia keta.
Unlike rolls with salmon, these have to be chewed longer, but the awareness that this fish is our, domestic, gives strength.
On the website of the store "Your People" there are even rolls of walnut and sea bass.
In sushi bars, however, to replace Norwegian salmon prefer Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that chefs are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
“Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us,” the owner of the Killfish Bar, Dmitry Evseev, said.
About the same situation with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy the vacated niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, Boris Akimov, we can now rather talk about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace banned imports unlike our farmers.
That is, large producers of other countries will primarily benefit from the ban," Akimov said.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
According to the results of mass unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are examining the substance of the claims made to determine the actions needed to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible,” McDonald’s said in a statement.
No one really knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be experienced, - says on condition of anonymity employee of the company engaged in restaurant consulting.
If McDonald’s is closed across the country, the scenario will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of traffic police references
Casco payments can be received without a traffic police certificate - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidelines, according to which from September 1 this year, to receive payments on the helmet, the insured motorist will be able to do without a traffic police certificate.
This, however, is only about those cases when the accident was executed under the "Europrotocol" without the participation of the traffic police.
That is, if only two cars participated in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers reached an agreement on the question of who is responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1, in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be raised to 400 thousand rubles.
The bottom line is that often even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be issued according to the "Europrotocol", drivers caught in an accident, cause DPS.
After all, if there is a policy casco to get a refund on it without a certificate of traffic police was impossible.
The parameters prescribed in the draft guidelines are designed to eliminate this obstacle to the introduction of the “Europrotocol” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment on the casco in connection with an accident, executed without traffic police officers, should not be lower than the limit under the "Europrotocol".
But at the same time it can not be higher than the limit specified in the insurance contract casco.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS employees and roads.
But, most likely, neither motorists nor insurers will be delighted with it.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of the growth of fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new rules for the payment of casco.
As for the drivers, it is hard to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the ancestral Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to arrange a minor accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is still not known what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol".
The savings certificate will be named and irrevocable
The Treasury wants to ban bearer savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will prohibit savings certificates for the bearer.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that bearer savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, since it is not necessary to make a deduction to the fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).
The piquancy of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and it will affect Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to the ASV, control 98% of the profile market.
Moreover, the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, ASV explains, is that clients of a small bank that bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of its license, try to get money from ASV.
Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments under these certificates in the case of revocation of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when holders of bearer certificates tried to recover insurance compensation through the court," the ASV said.
The problem, of course, is invented.
After all, no one will still pay buyers of certificates, since they by law do not have the right to compensation from the state.
If it were that the instrument is not insured in ASV, along with it would be banned and metal accounts, on which the funds of citizens are accounted for in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but no one is trying to exist yet.
The fact is, most likely, that bearer certificates are a very convenient security that can actually act as quasi-money.
At the same time, their movement is practically uncontrollable: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before cashing such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill stipulates that a savings certificate must necessarily be a nominal security, which must be stored in the depositary.
And to sweeten the pill banks, such certificates are allowed to issue without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogue of the irrevocable deposit, which bankers have long dreamed of, is introduced.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend there were protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclaw followed the developments for us over the weekend and spoke to protesters who came from all over the world, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31, citing the decision taken after the meeting of representatives of the German government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reportedly sending 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 rounds to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Delivery will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros for humanitarian aid to Iraq.
On September 1, Ms. Merkel will speak in the Bundestag with a government statement on the topic.
Until now, Germany has not supplied its weapons to “hot spots”.
The views of the people of Germany on the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters of the “Islamic state”, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militants shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to the available data, this happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shyrokyne and Bezymennoe (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports about the shelling of two boats of the coast guard.
It is clarified that the incident occurred today around 16:20 MSK.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO bushooker teenagers were taken by helicopter to safety after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man went on a hike shortly after noon on Sunday to Govets Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was dispatched, which included local police and a rescue squad, and the pair were found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and injured his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight and were lifted on a winch on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions have met.
The Minsk summit did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian Union.
Even on a troubling occasion (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure is able to work effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
Questions on this matter fell off on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them, other Eurasians and Europeans saw the new President Lukashenko in the news.
The Belarusian leader set an example of refined courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who had just cracked the jackpot – and is planning a decent old age in higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just the legitimacy of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is sure that from now on Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met tete-a-tete with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will be defrosted further,” he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparations for the breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
"Results have also been achieved with the EU - these are successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization," the Ogonka interlocutor lists, "and international security negotiations were held with the United States.
The United States has even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only undermined this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not left the Customs Union or the CSTO, and a Russian airbase is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noticed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenko’s move towards political diversification will be will be seen by how often Minsk will have to host meetings in the EU+TC format in the near future.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton was unable to promptly answer questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Spokeswoman for Ashton Maya Kosyancic told Ogonka that the issue was not a priority in the context of the resolution of war and peace issues.
At the same time, there were reports that the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format could be Kazakhstan.
A drop of tar for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that it turns out that he was personally asked by representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties do not mind that Minsk remains the central platform for meetings both in the format of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” acquires the status of a completely handshake European leader who helps to solve the global problem.
The best friend of a European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main background of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, but the economy.
Indeed, the schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the fears of the TC countries on the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU seems to be a more ambitious achievement than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
EU Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht said: “EU representatives have come to Minsk to look for a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around.”
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine is also “working” for Belarus.
Its consequences – and above all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia – give Minsk, which so far itself is experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited room for manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, ex-presidential candidate of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation bypassing sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin rushed Minsk at the summit.
“The initiators of these schemes,” Romanchuk emphasized, “are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies do not mind to establish production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $ 4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be in high demand.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the EU and the EU negotiating platform is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered farmers only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko’s credibility in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TC + EU format is discarded, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that Kiev was the initiator of the new format.
“It was your proposal to meet, without any attack to discuss, not from the bay-barahta to make a decision, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing at that time in Ukraine,” he said before the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to reassure Moscow, she, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic ministry carefully emphasized that Belarus does not pursue selfish goals in organizing the interaction between the EU and the CU on its territory, and the ultimate goal of this format is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
“This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation, put forward and promotes in other spheres, in particular in the field of security,” Ogonka said in the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, a department where words have been carefully selected lately.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entry
The Moscow government considers the introduction of zones with paid entry as a method of combating congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow on transport Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has proven itself successfully is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, look at all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that some decisions have been made in this regard," Liksutov said.
He stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and load to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recently begun construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was enough bypass infrastructure, then there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," the deputy mayor said.
Also, Maxim Liksutov said that the introduction of paid parking significantly relieved the streets of the capital.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop there.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, took part in the ceremony of laying the foundation for the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (TCAD).
Sinful boredom
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "The City of Sins-2: A Woman to Kill for" did not make the revolution that one could expect from him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), shot with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain of "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" for modern thinking (if we understand the thesis as the universe of noirs, and the antithesis as the cosmos of comics).
Henceforth it should read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"The City of Sins 2" is chaotic on both the dramatic and philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "City", although, here, the thug Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life in the electric chair, and here, nothing, only has time to grab - as a kind of people's champion - knives and other axes with bridles from the air.
But the old people are literally pushed with their elbows by newcomers, as if they broke into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, its story, shamelessly interrupted by the authors in the most interesting place, the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Her own - lustfully frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something vengeful Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, let's say, is indistinguishable from Johnny - all the more so since the faces, like other parts of the body, the characters are demolished with inexorable regularity - is not a problem and not even half a misery.
It's not people, we understand that these are the archetypes of noir: a fateful bitch, a self-confident player, a sex detective trapped in a honey trap, a corrupt vampire senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and chases the archetype, it is no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is just ridiculous.
And even in this tumultuous world, there is something permanent.
Fighting whores from the first "City" still hold a circular defense against the forces of darkness besieging their native slums.
Yes, and the ghost of Detective Hartigan no no, and look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of the City of Sins 2 is another.
Frank Miller was good in that, as a drawer, he talentedly combined comics and noir, and as a director, he reversed the idea of how to bring comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposite "reality".
The phenomenon of comics in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time as Dashiell Hammett's novels "Bloody Harvest" (1929), "Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of Noir, then called hard-boiled school - "cool school".
Or pulp fiction.
The comics have given Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Popeye - the eater of spinach, giving him heroic power, Superman, Batman and the syscake of Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "Avengers".
But in any movie based on comics there was something flawed: the drawn characters stubbornly did not want to be overgrown with screen flesh, they remained pretenders in the “real” world that surrounds them.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of "existence".
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - has lost all persuasiveness.
What Forsyths, what Thibauts and Rugon-Makkars, what Bolkonskys and Rostovs are even conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into the soap opera format, and the criminal - that is, by definition marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned in his skin what it was like to work as a paramedic at the front.
He was a communist.
By the way, there were, at least, close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Lawsey, Edward Dmitrick.
Therefore, the noir, the archetype of which they set, firstly, rude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
This is almost an American version of social realism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically combined the comic book with noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not ashamed of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a "real" film.
The darkness of a corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the killings and the senator covered the monstrous sadistic son, was quite worthy of the pen of Hammett.
And the picturesque details like the severed heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the feathers of the genius James Ellroy, the author of "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, the declaratively nauseating - representative of the Neo-Noir.
Sin City 2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller-Rodrigues radical stylistics to the comic book tradition.
This is largely due to 3D technology.
When you watch the second "City of Sins", you feel imprisoned in a glass ball, inside of which the snow sleeps a toy cloak.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody scraps, but in general, what is the difference?
There is nothing to say about socialism.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we sometimes have, even on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return a girl who went down a curved path or, say, tell her parents that her destroyer is punished.
When there is no place in the city of sin except sin, then sin is no longer sin, but the norm.
It's as boring as any standard.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic rental gave this fresh sin a small, but pepper.
The titles warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person is broken fingers with pincers, this gives hellish humor.
Hammett would have loved it.
France's socialists should "shut up and put France in order", says a key ally of François Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left to “demonstrate warmth” to the attacked socialist president, whose rearrangements have not been approved by the overwhelming majority of French.
The president deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him," he said, sparking applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question France’s controversial 35-hour workweek, despite conflict-provoking proposals it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande begged his Socialist comrades to remain "unit" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the minister of justice, put sticks in the wheels, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French "to lose faith in the future."
Marine Le Pe, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflicts among socialists, saying she had no idea the new Wall government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Vall, forced to assemble a new government when the former did not last a summer.
"And the new will not last either autumn or winter," Ms. Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
France’s ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A poll in Sunday’s Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Syans Poe, warned that the French will quickly lose patience if the new socialist government fails to fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
“Drug-free city” is left without a lawsuit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left without consideration the lawsuit of the administrative directorate of the regional ministry for the management of state property to the fund “City without drugs”.
The agency intended to recover from the organization more than 7 million rubles. as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the executive directorate of the Ministry for the management of state property of the region (MUGISO) to the fund "City without drugs" (one of the founders is the mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover from the organization 7.3 million rubles. as a fee for the lease of the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff twice did not appear in court, which is why it was decided to refuse to consider.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the directorate of MUGISO could not explain, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer phone calls.
Neither was it possible to contact the Foundation.
Recall, we are talking about the mansion, which occupied the fund in the city center on Belinsky street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by the former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Administrative Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court on eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the department demanded through the court to recognize the contract of free use of the premises of the mansion-monument as unconcluded.
According to the Directorate of MUGISO, the agreement did not record the essential conditions for the lease of the cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court rejected the claim, then an appeal was lodged with the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was granted.
The fund then filed a cassation appeal against the decision in the same court, which was unsatisfied, after which the fund appealed the decision to the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court accepted the direction.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, under which the fund began to pay rent again, the head of the city, Yevgeny Roizman, said.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubles. per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration has decided differently,” he said.
Tatyana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the pride of Yekaterinburg unified Russia Alexander Kosintsev proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the pride Evgeny Roizman to resign.
The reason was a criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of murder of the pensioner of the Gorduma deputy Oleg Kinev, who is considered an associate of the mayor.
How Evgeny Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "slander" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, where the Director General of the legal center "Protection" Anna Filatova applied with a corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her in his blog posts of being involved in crimes that her ex-husband allegedly committed.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will be turned into a wallet
On the eve of September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there are new leaks in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
According to sources, the sixth generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet as a result of a joint project between Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, can announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new iPhone 6 will be available mobile wallet function.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this.
This function allows you to make a payment at the cashier of the store using a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user by his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will for the first time be built-in technology NFC (near field communication), which allows you to make a contactless payment using a smartphone and the corresponding reader at the checkout.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC feature was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies included in the so-called NFC Forum - the association for the promotion of this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function – Samsung Nexus S – was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to tie bank cards to their Google account and pay with an Android smartphone.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their outlets.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris's position on Mistral supplies to Russia has not changed
The official representative of the French Foreign Ministry, Romain Nadal, said about the unchanged position of Paris regarding the supply of Russian helicopter carriers of the Mistral type.
“I can recall the statement of the President of the Republic (François Hollande) in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on August 20: “Today the level of sanctions does not hinder the supply.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not of France," Nadal told RIA Novosti.
Thus, the representative of the French foreign ministry answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change of position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.
For more information about the shipments of helicopter carriers to Russia, read the material of the magazine "Ogonek" "Mistral" is almost ours.

Norwegian Cruise closes $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company, access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises customers, as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The deal could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that talks could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain unnamed as the negotiations are not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while an Apollo representative declined to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 percent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that sail to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 percent higher than a year earlier.

Racing companies are striving to position themselves as the cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became a major shareholder in the company after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists today, in 2000, as a result of a merger with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Disrupt Chinese Representative’s Speech the Day After Election Decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Sunday determined the procedure under which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the 2017 Hong Kong presidential election.
All candidates must first get the support of a majority of the nominating committee members, which will likely be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it nearly impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and has forced Democratic activists to once again promise to stop Hong Kong’s financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong as Chinese party leaders fear the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control of Hong Kong in June, activists of the democratic movement held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business center and staged a sit-in strike.
Li's briefing is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Zhang Rongshun, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Bureau of State Council Affairs, were also scheduled to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students said they would meet outside the Hong Kong Prime Minister's building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority on the western bank of the Jordan River.
The decision to annex the land to South Bethlehem is linked to a desire to retaliate for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative control in the West Bank.
Saib Ariqat, a spokesman for the Gaza Strip, said the international community should hold Israel accountable for “continuing settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.”
Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on the “statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “statehood” of the secessionist region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status inside Ukraine needed to be reviewed to allow the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with the obvious strategy he has followed since the bloodshed began five months ago: to help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to get closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One, Putin condemned Ukraine’s military campaign to regain separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently named the occupied territories Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes peace talks will take place in the near future when Ukrainian politicians start campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions is a “prisoner of illusions.”
"We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to soothe fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman’s intervention to correct Putin’s “misinterpretation” of the words highlighted the Russian leadership’s decision to behave in a different way to the separatist uprising in the east than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much harder battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and polls before the conflict showed widespread support for wanting to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect Russia’s main territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia’s main military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic seaside resorts.
There are also mines, factories and foundries in the regions between Russia’s Rostov Oblast and Crimea that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers after the new elections weigh amendments to the constitution, allowing the separated regions more control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed insurgents’ new offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say is feared to be the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea itself.
This entailed large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow passageway to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching the point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take specific measures; the leaders called for drafting more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in case of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the struggling separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly detained in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Scandal with nude photos captures Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of candid photos showing nude Jennifer Lawrence got on the internet as a result of a massive hacking scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 candid photos of star of the “Hunger Games” Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahowski and Greco, who lives in Melbourne, were also allegedly stolen photos as a result of a leak from iCloud.
In the list of 101 names of celebrities.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and photos must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was “shameful” and that those targeted “feel they have been invaded.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying by the pool with her naked breasts.
Palmer's work in the film includes "Love and Honor" alongside Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of Chuck Strahowski and the actress from Forbidden Reception, Browning, did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
Lawrence told TMZ, “This is a brazen invasion of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, writing on Twitter: “Posting photos stolen from a mobile phone is actually no different than selling stolen goods.”
Just from a legal point of view, you can not tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
Discovered a potential way to steal photos of nude celebrities
The massive hacking of star accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario of events described by the resource The Next Web.
On the Github resource, a script in the Python language was published, which allowed you to select passwords for Apple's Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same bundle of login and password Apple ID, as for access to the cloud Apple iCloud, from which were stolen photos of celebrities.
The script allowed the search method to learn the password from Find My Phone.
This method sequentially enters all sorts of combinations of characters, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the Find My Phone service, the number of passwords entered is unlimited.
With the proper organization of the security system, after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and notify the user of the attempted hack.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about trying to find a password for their account.
Hackers learned the password from the Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Twitter post by Hackapp, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting program was written for it to match passwords.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user Hackapp and noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is typical for many services, but noted that there is no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the account "stars".
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister once again appeared the extraneous posts
While there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious activity using this service before.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not conduct investigations on how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also hacked earlier.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud as described above, then the password to the head of government’s account in the microblogging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web failed to receive Apple’s comments about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin grants Russian citizenship to Ukrainian pentathlon
Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The relevant decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and applied to the Federation of modern pentathlon with a request to give her the opportunity to play for the national team of the Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championship in the personal championship and became the world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
It holds the leading position in the current season.
According to the rules, in order to perform at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to obtain a special permission of the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.

SCR stopped the investigation of the crash of the Tu-204 in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (ICR) has terminated the criminal case on the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the airline Red Wings.

Anger proved to be the most universal and functional emotion of man.
An angry facial expression is biologically universal for humanity, and each organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists from Australia and the United States found.
Their findings were reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read briefly in a press release from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
An angry expression of the face - displaced and lowered eyebrows, stretched in a thin line of lips, swollen nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and it is made even by blind from birth children who have never seen it, says lead author of the study Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion arose for effective dispute resolution during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can inflict on another, the more opportunities he has to dictate his terms, and he communicates this to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
Researchers have found confirmation of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and switch to handshake, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavorable conditions on others, and also prefer force methods of resolving conflicts to peaceful ones.
Starting from the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of bargaining,” the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create angry facial expressions should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus force him to agree to his terms as soon as possible to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers modeled on a computer face where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although the lowered eyebrows or the chin extended forward separately did not make the face angry, the participants of the study unanimously recognized the person depicted with such physical traits as being stronger.
Human anger, like that of animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own power, forcing one to agree and obey.
A person inflates his nostrils and squeezes his lips with the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or a baboon that displays its fangs.
Anger is “triggered” by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that most effectively demonstrates to the opposite side the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tooby.
