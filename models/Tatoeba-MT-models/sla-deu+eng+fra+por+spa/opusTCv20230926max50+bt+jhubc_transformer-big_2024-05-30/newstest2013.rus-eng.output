Republican strategy to resist Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that cases of electoral fraud in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments since 2009 have enacted laws that complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 election, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed restricting voting rights in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to show a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of expression of will and deprive citizens with criminal records of the right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no state in the United States required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana became the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to show photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the voting age, do not have an identity card with a photo issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Student voters who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use a photo ID issued by their school.
But the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
This was the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin Americans.
It is believed that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on voting day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those wishing to register.
This restriction did not go without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the level of new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have enacted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the early voting period.
During the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of early voters were African-American, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the state's total voters.
The same thing happened with Latin Americans.
Representing only 11% of voters, they made up 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike the whites, who, forming 76% of the voters, among the early voters were only 46%.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has partially reduced the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules that have come into force will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats have condemned the bias of the laws that have been passed, seeing in them an obvious focus on influencing the results of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that states enacting these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Test or Not?
In fact, the PSA test gives sometimes erroneous results, false-negative, and sometimes false-positive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly undergoing a medical examination, there is much more to doubt.
To pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among groups of subjects, so the data obtained are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to develop any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates in those who were screened and those who were not.
This study also found, after a 12-year follow-up, that the likelihood of metastasis was 30-40% higher in those who did not undergo screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which does not pose a threat to life in the long run, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance of the disease.
To date, many men diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we accurately determine the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test.
But it’s also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not you need to take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of taking a PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people ate healthy and exercised enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, that number would have risen to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking cessation remains a priority, despite a decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to people’s health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the government.
10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the appearance of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the association added.
Meals
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," - explained in the Association.
Category: Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies can not be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies give contradictory results.
If one showed a reduced risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
The impact of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
However, Mr. Beaulieu stresses that it is important to discuss his worries and family history with the doctor.
"Passing the test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, a report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused a real stir – and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, neither much nor little.
Moreover, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted within the Standard Model—our best, or at least our least imperfect, description of the nature and behavior of matter—but which has not been previously discovered by experiment.
But physicists are not quite sure that we are talking about the Higgs boson.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although for complete certainty some data is still not enough.
Let’s assume that we are talking about the Higgs boson, because the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and let’s see what it means.
There is, in this world, one law absolutely inevitable, which states that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise you will harm yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of a similar nature: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermions, who reasonably obey the Pauli principle.
In the other, the bosons, a vile band of anarchists who have no respect for anything — at least this principle — are fussing, which means they can quietly be in the same place at the same time.
As reported by the site (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, about which we will not talk here, and "particles of force", through which the main forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boson belongs in some way.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic beings as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or "particle of light", which is the "courier" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disrupts” the electromagnetic field at that particular place, like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and hence one of the bosons of the "power carriers".
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be “broken”.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could be shaken only by a very large stone.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like the one operated at CERN – the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! – is needed to achieve such huge energies.
The electromagnetic field analogy is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick on the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like the photon, by the way) do not.
So, what “may bring” all this research, Ms. Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to sense the discrepancy between the results of observations and the predictions of SM.
In addition, some of them are eager for such a discrepancy to be discovered, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and shut some holes in the Model.
The latter, I must say, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
But so far, no such discrepancies have been found in CERN.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the daily life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is none.
See: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell’s labs could not have even guessed what kind of revolution their work would cause.
They envisioned their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally seen as a “laboratory gadget.”
Imagine...
And in addition, the application can be found for the toolkit accompanying the study.
For example, the same Billion Boyle during his optical research in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original purpose, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... <0x7C> Debt
The commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon, and at this time a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
"Debt" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer, destroying him from the inside, gave him a delay of two years.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor-Gadbois's palliative care home in Beloye, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, it’s impossible to prepare for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own and even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table where there is an appetizing lunch, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He wakes up, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicines, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before a normal death.
“My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this ailment.
“Throughout life, we are taught that a man should urinate standing,” says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Regression to the state of the child is an intolerable humiliation for some.
“It all depends on a person’s ability to accept decline,” he argues.
Since, according to many people involved in palliative care, important events occur even in the midst of this decline.
Patients who go to Victor-Gadbois palliative care are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses no longer provide a care called “treatment.”
Ms. A., 89, is most afraid of dying “with consciousness from suffocation.”
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything else in life,” she says before allowing her to put on a breathing mask.
She is still waiting in the coming days for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
The Victor-Gadbois shelter provides body care and nutritional assistance with the help of a group of volunteers.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
That's very little, given that sooner or later we're all going to die.
Here life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it is physical, emotional or mental comfort.
We'll give the dying man a mouth rinse of brandy or pepsi, depending on what he asks.
We no longer force diabetics to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son drank this beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help our loved ones as well as our patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of care.
At Victor-Gadbois, no day is like the previous.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies a young man 36 years old, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and tried everything to survive.
“In the last six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbois Shelter and the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Quebec’s health care system that makes many palliative care practitioners fear the passage of a law legalizing euthanasia and assisting suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by the Palliative Care luminaries, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr Christian Martel, Quebec’s health care system is insufficient to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance ward, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid that patients only want to die because they don't receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for Ellen Richard’s survival were already minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was stopping the fight.
She told me that my days were numbered.
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death are thanked by the medical staff for not fulfilling their request, after a palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to painkillers in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of his death, either from time to time or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Patients who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: “I want to die”.
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to be euthanized,” it means “I want to feel better.”
This report was made possible thanks to a journalistic grant from the Institute for Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about the colossal “system” entangling the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
An “industry” that has cost Quebec’s taxpayers very dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is curious how this system collapses after all the funds have been put into operation, jokes Jacques Ducheneau, MP and former chief of police of Montreal."
It was thanks to him that the scandal broke out in 2011 as a side effect of the investigation of official offenses related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of the time from the liberals, Jean Charais, agreed very reluctantly.
The Duchesne report established a direct link between industry, covert political party financing and corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts” if some had restrained their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonneau Commission has “already removed two mayors,” he adds, hoping it will be able to “open the schemes behind the individuals.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, which included a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the staff of the special unit "Molot", who after 2009 forced the "waste cartel" of Montreal, to stop overestimating the cost of contracts.
A series of searches has been carried out in recent weeks and several municipal officials, including Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next up is Gilles Vaillancourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the province’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing state orders.
In addition, several engineers of the Montreal Public Transportation Service and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were formally indicted.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the Montreal contracts to a mafia-related intermediary, who in turn transferred money to Mayor Gerald Trumble's United Montreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito spent more than C$88,000 (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) on various provincial parties, mostly liberals in power at the time.
In addition, he admitted to illegally raising funds for former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party Natalie Normando.
Sewerage contracts in which the cost was overstated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked flawlessly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: over a decade, he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, to golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey matches and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he inflated.
Other officials responsible for building the roads admitted to getting paid by inflating the bills by 30-40% with the help of fake supplements.
The mayor’s party organizer, Martan Dumont, then accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party’s cash registers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Trumble resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Roulot was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of Rivière de Prairie County in the east of the island, she has been opposing since 2010 the sale of a municipal plot bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will eventually be launched, she will “pull the string that allows you to understand the functioning of a system teeming with ants to stop gangrene and identify the culprits.”
She describes this process as “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we cleaned the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchenne notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about this scheme" but did not participate in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to $100 to parties, but he said it would not change the situation: “Unless we strictly limit election spending, politics will be dirty money.”
It demands a complete restructuring of the system of granting government contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go lower; by boldly understanding things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legality."
If this story casts a shadow over the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchenne invites those who laugh to look into their own yard ...
"PSG - not FC Barcelona!"
This season you have achieved an extraordinary sweep at PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors force me to raise the level of my game every day.
And during the game, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not hot.
From the very beginning at the NIF Pre-Training Centre in Clarefontaine until my arrival in Saint-Etienne, I always stepped forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
It is not new to play very high-level matches this summer.
They also know that every exercise is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me is eager to be on the level and put in the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports my positioning.
He is assisted by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the master of the situation?
Sure. Sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technical staff.
Today in the Premier League he has no equal and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I walked away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he places in me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the Premier League, Lyon took the lead from us.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have effectively qualified for one-eighth final.
What is the club’s goal in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen from now on.
We will be able to speak face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, ahead of Porto, in order to be able to take the rematch in one-eighth of the final.
Will PSG be able to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for it.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate its position for the long term.
That's not the case today.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project a reality.
Not taking the Premier League title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship.
Last season we were close to that.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
"Despite the fact that strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us, given how much has been invested and what players we have.
We are fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to implement the game's project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which for two seasons has not managed to make it to one-eighth final, although they also spent a lot of money!
Given the invested amounts, we represented you by 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be disrespectful to our opponents and to the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not at the top last season, were "awakened" by this new PSG.
This shows how exciting the Premier League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result we won.
PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, what if they say that there is some "Gold Dependence".
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's a Premier League star.
Everywhere he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a global star.
We respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's a disappointment.
I very much wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from taking some of my playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out of there stronger.
Today I can play good qualifying matches.
This is what I have been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave exemplary.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has good positions in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
“He’s a tough coach, he’s close to the players and he’s inspiring to win.
How was Laurent Blanc?
But I wouldn't want to compare.
“Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
Is a well-deserved draw (1-1) scored on October 16 in Spain a fundamental match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, in my career there were no such matches.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current money exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties with commission fees for their processing.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, a political vision is evident: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows file sharing between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin’s exchange rate, which peaked at $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning to about $10 today (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, was interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competing with the dollar or the euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as "credits" used to promote a video game, which are earned during the game or which can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously book holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses, much like an email.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically, using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public ledger sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through solving a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the hashing phase of a file, that is, the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" them all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction is thus inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will alter the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, a user would very quickly (in less than ten minutes) want to pay twice with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the prize is regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by one hundred millionth, which leaves a reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites providing Bitcoin services have been attacked, and bitcoins have been stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noise, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
"Giant Sales" was announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmqvist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noise, another author of the manual on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, making it cheaper.
The owner has better control over his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to provide an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by the phone, Pierre Noise clarifies, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“Bitcoin will take some time to establish itself, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB’s report proposes, incidentally, to review the various risks considered heightened today if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapis and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying solely on us.
We mainly affected Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are tolerated, they are sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be there once the West behaves more delicately.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles escorted by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and in blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for these peasants’ obscurantism, surpassed by al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved today.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen seizing state land to resell it for construction to the returnees who returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, have not even fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have succeeded in American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves the mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that look everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, leading the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to rebuild the provincial troops, which would not be subordinate to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to some extent, modelled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially ahead of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, has been dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that Western countries were there only to take over.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site, without means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province’s largest employers.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a great extent, should one day restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, for boys, the Faculty of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "conquer hearts and minds" and accomplish the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the "military-civilian activity" service under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in the region.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labor, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing the area of arable land.
What will we keep in our memory after spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often above 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Capisa.
To get rid of the foreign-led uprisings that the farmers want, as they told me, they need a little non-military support that is well-controlled and comes directly to them.
The Difficult Birth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he decided to play in the bank.
Surprising everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state granted the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
Soon, for two years now, Egypt is relying on a provisional text that has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal controversy.
This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic delusion”, continuing to “violate this word” and “trample on the law”.
His followers in the camp believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which causes the Brothers to abandon the intention of explaining to the Egyptians the text, article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The call for an expedited vote resembles an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I retain my extraordinary powers,” which is supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, in most cases, the articles were voted on unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around ... the time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the clock of the Constituent Assembly had been set wrong.
The text, which was voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained identical to the article of the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of Shariah are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" with "rules", which would allow for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” respond the liberals, who see it as PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, particularly with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, because "the people called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the birth of theocracy.”
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the university’s next rector appears to be far less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemas, but people with university degrees, some trained in the French system," says Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on Egypt's constitutional transition.
But he admits that "ambiguity may arise around Article 220, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the fiqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how civil judges are competent to rule on this.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will not be considered in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
There will also be no ban on the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider to be detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy remains, and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles talks about the protection of women anymore, emphasizes Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive aspect was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Earth's navel and the sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the pristineness of nature.
AIF highlighted five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that on all who enter this "bath" God's grace descends.
And Galilee is the place of the miracles of Jesus: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
Most of the saints in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Way of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the Fortress of Antony - Praetorium - where there was a judgment, and through the streets of the Old Town leads to the Temple of the Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of Anointing and the place of Jesus' burial.
Here is the symbolic Christian belly button of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which a cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place for the Jews - the Wailing Wall, left of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave notes here with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a journey vertically.
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained from the secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on vertical cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are passionate about mountaineering can get to them.
The rest are brought to this historic peak by a cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus delivers to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly lived pagan gods.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't go to all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
You should also visit the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exposition are widely represented the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which is a few halls of ancient Turkish baths with imitations of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth going to the unique part of the Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it, and you're in total darkness.
The stars are flickering.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Healing
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, they swim even in the winter months, since the water temperature there does not drop below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and they swim there all year round.
By the way, this most extraordinary sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a brine that easily keeps afloat even those who do not know how to swim at all.
The landscapes around are unrealistically beautiful.
They come here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - rapeseed, and healing mud, and to cure health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, to put in order the shaken nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street "your" sign, Fortune will be benevolent.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander around the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A Tourist's Note
When going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money for the trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
Public transport is mainly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper City.
In fact, it's an underground funicular.
The fare in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Shabbat is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop working.
On Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk with meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, a variety of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israel.
But there are a lot of fattened cats that are nicely "walking on their own".
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The mounds love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
A bicycle rental will cost 15 sheq. per day.
Tickets to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from all over the world.
The most to travel and rest came citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
“Great and mighty” to Moscow: migrants save money on language
While deputies and human rights activists are arguing that the law on mandatory language testing will give, there are already scammers in the country who sell “lime” certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their sole purpose is to earn money to support families left behind.
On December 1, the law came into force, according to which every migrant worker will be obliged to take an exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and utilities, household and retail.
However, over time, the FMS promises, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Moreover, it will be necessary to pass not only the language, but also the Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both for obtaining and for extending a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Not subject to the law and people who managed to get certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, doom and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass the tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already opened in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of testing was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times had time to ask the press the question: and what, in fact, will it give?
What will change the obligatory knowledge of the language for both Russians and visitors themselves?
First of all, - the representatives of the migration service answer, - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Very many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the representative office of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only the system of organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise among migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, who do not have a medical certificate.
Without understanding the language, the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will push him into a creepy, narrow barracks, where he and dozens of his like will languish for months without food and documents, flogging 12-14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“In their homeland, they are promised one thing, and on arrival they are deceived, their passports are taken away, they do not pay the promised salary,” the head of the Main Department of Labor Migration of the ICC of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov, confirms.
Don't argue, inhabitant!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, going to work in Russia, admit that not only do not know the language of the country to which they aspire, but also on their own write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as a problem: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a good primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed their children, not to mention to properly dress them, shoes and equip them for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys at the first opportunity go to earnings.
It’s hard if you have a bad knowledge of the language, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, human rights defenders note one important point.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or no one will be allowed in."
Many of the visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly fake documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"They will ask a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Khushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters.
"Fly, don't be cheap, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it turned out that not only migrant registration documents are fake.
Several "leaky" certificates of passing language tests have already been seized by FMS employees.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got the new owners not in vain: each of the migrants, hoping to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than two times more expensive than the procedure of official testing: it will cost a migrant laborer three thousand.
The fact that the main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “crusts” can not be simply bought, both representatives of the authorities and human rights defenders agree.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers who failed to successfully pass the test for the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
Proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is extremely low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law against the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Pressing shots at weddings, when there were no casualties, and the massacre organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which Press seven people died.
Police want to ban the wearing of trauma in public places and raise the age from which you can get a license for weapons - from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by “twisting the nuts”.
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand to abandon the "meaningless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian service of the BBC lawyer-criminal Vasily Lesnikov.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in six months of 2012, 142 crimes with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies were committed, while in the same period, 1168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter believe that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not place the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The “black” arms market is replenished through several channels.
The main such channels are five, says retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a site accepting orders for weapons
The first is the "army or military trail", that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were carried by Russian officers and Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
The next type of “black weapon” is stolen by criminals from representatives of law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that this includes both stolen from police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "barrels" go on sale from military warehouses.
There were frequent explosions at many military depots.
"There are proven versions that some of the arson was done on purpose - to cover the shortage," says the former military.
According to Barantz, arms manufacturers are making their contribution.
“Currently, private weapons factories are growing, which cannot withstand competition on the international market and throw weapons from the floor to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Particularly many guns and machine guns come from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
“There is its own production, sometimes artisanal, and the mafia formed, which organized the flow,” explains the former military.
Where'd the guns come from?
Experts estimated the approximate share of each of the sources of supplies of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this in 2011 was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
The experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on weapons topics.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there “by the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of weapons production, 5% fall on “black archaeology”.
A sales consultant at one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, assures that the weapons found by black miners have long since been bought - too old.
Most often, he says, sellers go to a military warehouse for the new batch.
Through the ensign, a person buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
He's being discharged, passed through the fence.
"He's transporting it to the city and here he sells 900 euros apiece with two stores," he says.
“The truth is, the police are aware of all cases, so periodically, when the plan to solve crimes is on fire, they conduct a control purchase from illegal arms dealers,” the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at sites, blogs, until a comrade responded, who offered to come to the platform "Begovaya", where there will be a person who will take me to the "corner", where we will bargain.
The price of the gun I knew only there
Victor Baranets
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, - says the sales consultant. - I have such a friend, but I'm not sure about him.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, “from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell you that his daughter’s tooth fell out.”
I'm even getting a couple of cassettes through a man I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me, too, because he knows I won't pass him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article about it.
Schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album of photos with "anything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Barantz, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, do not just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, there we put a target.
“I’m given the opportunity to shoot, and when I’m convinced that the guns are hitting well, we start bargaining,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet bring to sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents and personal meetings.
“It is enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in an advertising cap on the website “Buy a military pistol or machine gun”.
Users leave their requests and ask questions.
Will they sell to minors?
"Without a license of course," asks the user "Ivan" (orthography saved).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - laconically formulates the request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of fake sites and those wishing to buy combat weapons are rowing with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then extract coal in Siberia

I have heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer through the ATM makes the payment.
"In response, they send a photo and instructions where the weapons are hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the Right to Weapons public organization.
Viktor Baranets claims that by leaving an application on the site, you can remain without weapons and get behind bars.

“People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they extract coal in Siberia,” he argues.
Makarov for $ 100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can save from $ 100 to $ 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to Weapons organization, Makarov’s gun can be purchased for $ 100-300.
You'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from warehouses of long-term storage by the management of these middle-level warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the department, compared to January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of revealed facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States strike workers of fast food and supermarkets
McDonald’s accounts account for up to a quarter of all American teenagers.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests across America against low wages in Walmart department stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one has begun to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth shaft or it is destined to expire in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages that Walmart employees and fast food systems receive, the protesters’ goal is to create trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “Black Friday”, when an orgy of cheap sales fell on America, capturing millions of ordinary people and sometimes accompanied by fights.
On this day, some employees of Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and marched along with unions and left-wing activists to the stores of the corporation, whose goods are designed for people of modest and medium income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage Walmart employees are burdened only at work.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheaper in part because it pays its employees little.
The latter also complain of harsh working conditions, for example, the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
To a typical Walmart worker who receives $9.5 an hour, this cost is out of pocket, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, say that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's spending on her salary now.
If Walmart puts the whole salary increase on the shoulders of customers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they will be spending some $ 12.39 more than they are now.
Supporters of Walmart quite note that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause the corporation the slightest damage.
Black Friday lasted in her stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart was selling about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers produced almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
In an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post, Dan Fogelman, a spokesman for Walmart, said a total of “less than five” Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was just “another PR stunt” by the union that organized it.
"Free cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their targets were not Walmart department stores (they are not spared in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and after that, it doesn’t even give you sick leave or pay you for honest work!
Jumayne Williams, Member of the New York City City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average, their average worker earns $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less in this expensive city.
How it is possible to exist in New York with such money is incomprehensible to me.
At one time, almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through McDonald’s, who worked behind their counters after school, while living with their parents.
Few saw it as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Nowadays, I constantly come across interviews with McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children for it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But it is difficult to include fast food in the trade union for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary turnover of personnel.
Disagreements
Noisy protests took place on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was a midday rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democrat politicians, in particular, councilman Jumayne Williams, who stated: "McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and after that he does not even give you the honor of the hospital and does not pay you for it!"
Other prominent New York Democrats supported the protests, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said: “We must unite to support fast food workers so that they achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!”
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, and not all of them were workers of fast food, which in New York employs tens of thousands of people.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will give rise to the flames of mass movement.
“So far, deceiving the brain is average.”
Popular among fans of modern technologies, the theme of augmented reality has recently been perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At first, in the summer at its annual conference, Google showed the current model, and then in November it became known that the application for the corresponding patent filed and Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D-technologies at the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi, it follows that for scientists of this company glasses - the stage has passed.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Can you tell us in general terms what your research team is doing?
We are dealing with human interaction with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity in the mass is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes ticking in them with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else awaits us?
“Despite the fact that Kinect has taken interaction to the physical level, a lot is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very good yet.
We are trying to change that, we are working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, to make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It definitely can not be called a panacea - the issue of privacy arises, because you do not always want to inform others about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about sweeping ones, but about such meager, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were not filmed with the camera of the device, but with a wristband that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- Like, how are you gonna ask me to hand you that can of soda?
You will say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that's gonna be hard to tell.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can not at the moment?
It's not necessary, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth or something?
- In principle, the current generation is something we can build on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 fps.
But it is not about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the latter point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds to the work of algorithm designers.
That is, it is necessary to remember not only about the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 fps is frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Bettishes of our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would be very useful in my work the equivalent of such a device, but does not require touch, so that the frames per second was more.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the second is a receiver of a reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, a conventional sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Possibly more cameras could solve the problem...
Or increase it by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how this will help in the three-dimensional determination of the position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time walking around, holding the smartphone in raised hands is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be "transitional" augmented reality, when based on the cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and so on everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from "Iron Man", but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: there is no tactile feedback!
My hands can't feel anything!
What are your team’s responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth can be quite an addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
She's a great recorder of push-ups!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at making these "images in the air" tangible - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is, gives a feeling, but for now it is very weak - as if you have blown on the pads.
There are bracelets on the wrists, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Did you try to trick your brain?
To make him think he's feeling what he's supposed to feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another task, which will have to fight for a long time - how to make a person who is physically in a very limited space, believe that he is going on an open, almost endless - we work on the concepts of treadmills (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While deceiving the brain turns out to be average, the work is still very many years.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to a researcher—many things are in their infancy.
Tasting instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top list has already included bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the shocking artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man dressed in all red, who meets at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then at fashionable parties and vernissages.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always gather crowds of viewers wherever they exhibit.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical fairy tales, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets causing a smile in the citizens, cheering everyone up.
Recently, he picked up a sharman and became a St. Petersburg sharman, as he matured for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you still walk around the city in all the red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, engaged in the look and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker, and society.
Although in society, everything that is almost gray causes aggression and excitement of a bad character.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DC Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I knew this was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and the new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazone community, which led to the Pushkin-10, and there was no more wave.
It throws me into theater, clothes, music, into all genres, except the word.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there, while there was no repair, there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOMY, Tequila-jazz, I remember how Cord was brought with the project “Ear of Van Gogh”.
Cord and his friends sang light songs under plywood, they were in a tight leotard, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs until the Hali-Galilian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he received basic education and upbringing from us.
Gallery "D 137", the club "Griboedov" are echoes of the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regulars went.
I am a hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "People of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the year" was named me, my climax was over.
In the new times it is uncomfortable to work according to the old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It is easy to become popular these days, but culture and popularity are separated, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I'm going to have a program exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now being so is painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything is blurred, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by totalitarian disguise in an orderly manner.
Now on clothes meet, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the internal person.
Or maybe he can't hold his hand and spit in his face.
And deception will be removed with the help of disguise.
And recently we saw you as a city charmer. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me, will be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be neat, tactful, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
Previously, people rallied in packs, bohemians loved one thing, commoners another.
Now everyone is divided into micro-communities, now it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who will like you.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov comes in a few thousand!
- He gets thrown, there's a sex-social sphere that works.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result, less management, money, everything will fade.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the gain.
In my youth, I painted such paintings that one collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that usually end.
Nowadays, concepts are often confused.
They say: spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money for the sake of painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can do culture.
With the right kings it was not so, the kings may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that it is necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are pushed, because we need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
The taste buds are flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are such artists who should look for themselves other museums.
What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
And on our stones, art is hard to grow.
We need cultural ground, and we now have more writers than readers, which is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this thin layer.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Born in Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board go in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue its kind in the conditions of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be explored at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute named after P.K. Sternberg (GAISh).
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approach to the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments on plants were conducted.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the introduction into orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies - drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to test how the embryo develops in weightlessness.
We get an absolutely normal chick at the exit.
And then the problem begins.
“The problem is that this chick has to find support, he has to stand on his feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Unable to find support, the chicks roared indiscriminately.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we hatched chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev states the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological "minikovich" flew into orbit with animals was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with a fetus.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural there.
"It was just on biosputniks, but again - this is a single experiment, and such research should be carried out," - said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not easy.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply can not realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, humans can, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, no such experiments are carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is a female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it would survive after the flight into space.
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
“No one answered this question,” says rocket and space industry veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father Andrian Nikolaev was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice visited orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We do not have enough, there are a number of cosmonauts, who after long flights cost everything, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even during orbital flights," summed up the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC hydrolab is an obligatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts practice their skills in open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for infants - a native element.
Small ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months at the mother in ovarian fluid, it is easier for him to get used to water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"It's very little to forget something," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a child born, then gravity, the force of gravity, is necessary for a woman.
Very quickly, in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, the ability to push the fetus falls.
All right, let's drop that, too, relying on birth stimulators.
You can, of course, in a special chamber go to childbirth, she will push him out.
"And then what?" - asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling earthly attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and muscle system.
It is impossible for a newborn in orbit, as an adult, to wear a special weight suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what will be vital to him.
"And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely disadapted person," - predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the IMBP of the Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while, it will be a reality when the Earthlings on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Main Control and Audit Department: The inspection of the black system failed because of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kal, Vice-President of the Supreme Control and Audit Office, from an interview for the website Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack,” Kala commented on the current situation.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
An example of wrong practice is the approach of Peter Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called black-system.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the FDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is it forbidden or allowed?
“The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the Prime Minister can not oppose the work of the institutions, which are charged with the duty to check and seek the fulfillment of obligations,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German sides, in which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
I mean the parallel check that we started, probably, two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation determines how public procurement should be conducted, followed by national legislation and then also implementation in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with an unfinished check, interesting differences were found - simply put, the legislation we have can be "accurate and unmistakable", but in practice we are inferior to Germany in some respects.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is such joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the order limit.
Perhaps this system will be filled with "papers" so that those who want to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction was not reduced.
You are talking about internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our CRU (Control and Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof acts as our CRU, organized on our principle, there is also a board that works a little differently, but basically both institutions function in a similar way.
In addition, the powers are similar to some extent, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal states - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounting Chambers.
As for local legislation, is it easier there than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a sample, but it is not certain that it is better in everything.
Is it because they're better at controlling?
Definitely not, but I repeat, I don’t like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have benefited from working with our office, right?
In terms of domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, does it somehow have consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet manifested itself in our monitoring work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future audits - we have started to use our new tool "detecting the risk of non-austerity", through which we have driven almost 14,000 government contracts. We have analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the restrictions change, the conditions of some types of tenders change, and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law will benefit or put an additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be “tightened” and will be impossible to comply with.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are associated with the supplier (e.g., regional operational programmes - with a regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be toughened in this way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with the inspection of the so-called black-system. What does this mean?
"Schwarz system" banned or allowed?
The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies charged with verifying and enforcing obligations.
You can say, “We will change this law and allow it,” but you can’t say that we will pretend that nothing is happening.
The Law on Public Procurement contains quite strict rules on how and what should be formally carried out, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery in some places, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
They are mostly passable, but in some places with more caution.
Karlovy Vary
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region the roads were passable, but in some places frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day should be slightly warmer.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From information received from regional road workers, it became known that places had lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 highway and first-class roads in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third class, including mountain trails, are passable.
But in some of their areas, there are still remains of frozen and sometimes sloped snow.
You need to be especially careful on highways.
Pardubice and Kralovegradetsky Krai
The Czech Highways and Roads Authority on its pages on the Internet informs that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are threatened by ice, and on mountain roads and roads located on high elevations, there may be a covered layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about ice, which can form especially on the hills of the Pardubice region.
Ice can be near Lanskroon, Usti nad Orlicí, Shelf, Svitavy or Vysoké Mito especially on second and third class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located at Svitavy, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and Orlicke Mountains.
The snow layer is located on the roads located on the hills in the areas of Rihnov nad Knezhnou and Trutnov.
In the East of the Czech Republic today there is variable cloud cover without precipitation.
The temperature usually ranges from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is freezing, the temperature varies from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, it can be slippery in some places.
In some places, drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now practically unrestricted, however, road operators recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plze<0xC5><0x88> and Tahove can fall frozen areas.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and also in this case there is a warning in connection with the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be cautious, especially on little-used roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the hills of the Olomouc Territory should take into account the snowy gruel on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Mountain saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videlian Cross.
At night, the snow forced the road workers to go on the street, according to information from the road administration, in <0xC5><0xA0>umperk fell about three centimeters of snow.
In other areas, the edges of the road are usually unrestricted.
"On the hills of Shumperk lie the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Jeseník should be aware of the presence of snow gruel in the Red Mountain saddle," the Sumperk road traffic controller told the CAN (Czech News Agency) today.
At night, their colleagues from Yesenik went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the hills after treatment with chemicals remained bare and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads are unrestricted, but in Sternberg drivers must be careful in forest areas where humidity is still maintained.
Ustetsky Krai, Liberec Krai
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia reported that several hard-to-pass areas remained.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, a mountain road was closed on the site from Telnice at the Clinic in the Ustecky Territory.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the south-east of the Czech Middle Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Shcheti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - all day it rained and snowed, at night the sky cleared and frosts began.
Unfavorable conditions are reported on the main highway and on the I/13 highway on the border of the Ustecky and Liberec Territories.
Due to the curved under the snow, branches of trees related to the road itself were forced to close the road in Telnice on Kninice.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing news that we humans get so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we constantly joke on this topic and say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell your readers more about this?
This is a national fundraising event that we have been planning for two years now.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20, at 21:00, three concerts will start in parallel in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours, the May calendar will end.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all came up with together with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of this world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus also support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also sang the anti-end-of-the-world anthem called "The End of the World Is Cancelled".
Will the YouTubers’ favorite anthem be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if everything works out and the end of the world does not come.
It will be sung by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be played live on Czech television.
The lyrics to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the video by Tomas Ganak, also participating in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We are actively involved in these projects.
It turns out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the civil association Tap at the Yedli<0xC4><0x8D>ki Institute.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of the Yedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the faculty, and we try to give them this opportunity.
As part of the project of additional construction of the Yedlichka Institute in the future, a separate building will arise, to which we will move with this project.
There will be several musical groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that would interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Suhi will perform.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "grand events" in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would like to perform in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
You have serious plans for abroad, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics??
It’s not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and toolboxes.
However, while coping with this without problems. Czech airlines <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me how many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything is working better than ours, in Russia we have witnessed that in the East it is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are many barriers in Moscow, and here it is still odd to independently move a person in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also, there are no such trivial things as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that try to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things whose level of performance is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people who are affected.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with severe disabilities independently move on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere ...
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Public respect or barrier-freeness is one thing, but at the moment when famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then everything will really start to change.
For now, these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is very popular nowadays, but back to two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Yedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute as a teacher, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself and also play the saxophone, I organized an interesting music circle with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our host Ladya Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Is it just the last few years, or am I confused?
It was true, it helped us that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate is, in fact, as if it does not exist.
Thanks to European Union funds, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to unleash The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in being able to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things that imitate each other.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, pity, it is natural ...
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned personalities that we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's a shift not just for them, but for the whole society.
Has it succeeded that you are the strict leader that many people believe you to be?
If we want to do the job well, we have to be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But this is what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
There are currently 20 members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovi<0xC4><0x87>.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent it.
For those who have the will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno - at the Fleda club and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by telepost at the time of the performance of the song by The Tap Tap "The End of the World is Cancelled".
The aim of this project is to raise funds in the amount of CZK 25 million for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEEO educational center at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 CZK, for children under 12 years of age admission is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, at the European Space Agency ministerial meeting, Poland was accepted by the 20th member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and during the following years took an active part in a number of ESA projects.
But the path to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always met with understanding.
Let me recall, for example, the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Louis Hirsch Awards for "Introduction to Space."
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned space propagandist, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a railway train equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket had to be used to accelerate or brake the truck.
Information about this train is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The research was carried out by the Arms Technology Section in cooperation with Professors Mieczys<0xC5><0x82>aw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzycki.
From the surviving materials it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of the German troops, work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric fighter missile, proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the work "Air torpedo rocket and aviation bomb missile" by the author Lelyva-Khivlozky was published.
Both projects were developed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects for the military use of missiles were carried out by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczyskowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended due to the outbreak of the war.
The next scientific work devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The society was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problems, which published four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) has been trying to join the International Astronautics Federation (founded in 1951), and already in the fall, the PAA became a full member of it.
The following year, the first chairman of the POA, Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902-1959), became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakeeta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, able to overcome the distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, tests of the two-stage RM-2 missile were conducted in the Bled wasteland.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to engage in real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to observe the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1S - 0.62 liters.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a launch weight of 380 kg was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then were built versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Abolishing the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the law on public works.
The decision sparked a heated debate in the community.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic subdivisions, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (wages) there is a price tension.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the state when the producer, by means of the delivery of cheap goods, tries to stand in economic competition by "beating down" the value of the competitor in order to take away most of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearing. As a result, unemployment increases in those countries where the cost of labor, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable expenditure of the state on social needs increases.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social and economic damage they cause in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
The unscrupulous methods of private capital create situations at the level of the economies of individual states when the governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own populations to private capital despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the current legislation.
The goal is to economically force its people to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for reducing the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for several years, there has been a social distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves by their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra so that they get a living wage.
Such a scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist for a miserable wage in the backyard of society in the hope that private investment capital will one day come to the country.
But the question is, where will it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still work for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the state should not intervene in the economy.
Next, the question must be answered whether private capital, now practically managing politics and the entire state, does not act for its own selfish purposes?
The unambiguous answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of almost omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in legislation, where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to lack of funds, entrust the drafting of bills to private law firms that are closely related to industry.
The bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the Western type says, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal democracy is now quickly finding itself in such a situation, as described by Appian in The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been disintegrating, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribes, the illegal receipt of graces with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote"""...decent people did not run for the post of ruler at all, in the end, one day the state for eight months was left without a consul.". .. "Having seriously started to talk about what the only salvation in this terrible situation would be the impala, but the impala became the autocracy, and the need to choose an energetic man ".
As in ancient times, in modern society, its own reckless interests prevail without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer intrinsically intended for public use.
The present result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes we must look for in the reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the share of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence, and it can never come out" - Sting, the song "Fragile", where the main verse of the refrain is the words: "don't forget how fragile we are".
“If my sons did not want war, there would be no war.” – Gutel Schnapper, wife of Meer Amschel Rothschild
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has generated a lot of response.
Some support Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that the State of Israel is racist, that the Palestinian Arabs are being genocided, and that the State of Israel is being attributed the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who, in these periodic waves of murder, is a criminal, and who is a victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and have not witnessed the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who primarily serves the 95-year-old tension (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my arguments are backed up by historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is, first and foremost, the history of the struggle for power.
In every age we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards predetermined goals.
We must assume that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families, one stands out that could be considered the head of a spruce (I don’t know if anyone is standing above them, but that’s not ruled out) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Sure. Sure.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought as early as the nineties of the 19th century to stop the rumors linking their name to criminal activities in the higher spheres in whose shadow they were, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth or both at the same time.
They have large stakes in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are fighting or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of their country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the central bank status of the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began issuing his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 at the theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by the great 33rd-level Freemason Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third should lead to the reduction of the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume many resources), the creation of a single universal religion for the project.
The method by which a group of the wealthiest families, led by the Rothschilds, operates is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao – order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the Fed, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in unleashing World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia by starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militaryly and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, there was a fragmentation of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the unleashing of the Second World War, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge war reparations on Germany, which created a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it remained only to throw the Germans a strong enough one, convicting the guilty and offering simple solutions to the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke from the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by war reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create the hearth of a third war.
If the international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victims of the fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a gigantic laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers push people to vote in elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a global conflict - the stock of oil is only the stock of all, and given Iran's control over the Ormuz Strait is 20% of the world.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a common crisis and people will accept the New World Order.”
The new world order in their view is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted at birth with a chip, with which it becomes a being under total control.
"And he compels all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that a man who is not marked with the name of the beast or with the number of his name may neither buy nor sell.
This is the wisdom: anyone with a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of a man, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When it's worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution to the United States, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation was not expected to be a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because this could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was not able to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later amplified by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were finally released after 444 days of negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, “Operation Argo” describes one of the episodes of that story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After difficult twists and turns, they ended their journey at the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, while helping an extravagant cover legend, according to which they traveled on Canadian passports as members of the crew, looking for a place in the country to shoot a sci-fi epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, invented by evacuation expert Tony Mendes, demanded Hollywood’s cooperation.
In order for the legend to be credible, specialized magazines wrote about the film project, press conferences were held, the fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "cinema film", a story of a successful venture, a scam - an example can be a number of films about Ocean's friends.
The moods are constantly changing in the film - on the one hand, documentary scenes from Tehran (the credits show iconic historical photos of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lighter Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in costumes discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of the institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck did a great job of restarting his career.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director, and his play ceased to be an object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third feature-length film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The City" (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleck film that is not filmed in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place at the same time refers to the qualities that elevated the earlier films of the director above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it at Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when somewhere the story suddenly changes.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (fake headquarters at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply a lot of exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes he thinks something out - it all comes out not so elegantly (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at the airport of Tehran, and chasing on the runway looks rather far-fetched).
The disadvantage of Argo is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
The film lacks a bit of drama, it is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, judging the staging and retro-style, recreating the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind one, still in a certain sense of living history, as well as to testify to how exaggerated are the notions of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce a competition for the "most absurd regulation or project from the EU workshop".
“We were prompted to this latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said Patrick Nager, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities already put forward for the nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify the rates of insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop people can put forward for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013," Nager said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuels, which as a result harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of the cage for hens, as a result of which eggs have significantly increased in price this year.
Also criticized was the de facto ban on the use of the term "sandwich oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic light bulbs.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes decisions under the pressure of a particular trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (thus, the Czech Republic now even defends the demands of its banks under the threat of veto).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show "abnormal curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonises existing disparate national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, has still softened standards on fruit and vegetables, citing the fact that existing directives will lead to the waste of products.
Last year’s EU regulation, according to which sales of balloons must be provided with a warning that children under the age of eight can not inflate them without the supervision of adults, can be a candidate for winning in the survey.
The EU has turned to American studies, according to which balloons when playing are a potential cause of death of children by suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from blowing into fair dummies.
Funny ideas are born at home.
Quite absurd is the rule concerning the European officials themselves: anyone who has any official position in the EU, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, can not use the name of Macedonia, but should instead say "FYROM" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the liberal economists’ association “Laissez Faire”, proposed for the vote, in addition to several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that can be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for applying for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," then-Agriculture Minister Yaroslav Palas (ChSDP) said in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high crop of grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the State had full stockpiles of stocks that needed to be taken out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for the grant were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to be used to prepare an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Weird orders are an exception
Although the regulations in the member states are easily criticized, the EU’s efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, are rather worthy of recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is drawing on EU subsidies for projects that do not even have a hint of anything in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved when discussing the budget.
It is also emotion among Czechs that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name "Olomouc cheeses", but "Tuzem rum", whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemak".
Rum can only be called products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "gorgondzola", marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, were already, for example, Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pogorzelick and Tr<0xC5><0xA1>ebo<0xC5><0x88> carp and <0xC5><0xBD>atec hops.
Also, the EU trademark can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Gorzic tubes.
“People want me to protect the republic, but I’m an amateur,” Okamura said.
Senator, how does it come to a person's mind to run for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country being robbed in the last 20 years, the thieves raging around here, the people raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I am forty years old and I am an independent person who does not belong to any party, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You were in the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who have chosen you?
I have always said that I will join the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the result of the elections to the Senate.
I later clarified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool with which I can implement my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the broadest authority.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation are grumbling at our bar or at the TV, but at the same time we are ready to trample down anyone who tries to change something.
Added to this are the media, which defame people and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was bribing journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri Paroubek.
Let’s move on to your views.
You started the fight for the presidential castle with theses on the material and criminal liability of politicians and on reverse property declarations worth more than twenty million.
To do this, the law needs to be changed.
You have no such authority as president, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied for tours to become a free enterprise, this was promoted.
The problem is politicking – when someone comes up with a good offer on the left or right, they are deliberately put up with obstacles, and that deters citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan person, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country, and apply it, without being party-oriented on the shelves, without looking at the dogmas.
Do you consider yourself to be more on the right or on the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people refer to me more to the left.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not that someone belongs to the right, but someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for the public, whether it will be proposed by the PCHM or the FDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you’re a populist.
But are you not proving it by what you have said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
It may be called populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already functioning in the world, or they are spoken about by eminent experts.
But without the support of the parliament, you will be left with only slogans.
You won’t last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I had been elected president, it would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the chairmen of parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong personality who will voice abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of the pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and I will try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I’m trying to get things on my own; if it doesn’t work out, I’ll be back in the private sector in six years.
In part, it sounds like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I alone will not do anything, so I bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, he refused due to a lot of work.
I also at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorentsova, who uncovered the light fuel oil product fraud.
I nominated because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I’m on the scale.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us in the Senate.
The people have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Do you want to start your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the purity of every potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money to do it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You talk about property declarations, and what about your own affairs with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb for a million, well, a few more million in the account.
By the way, I had an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You drive an Aston Martin, own a $60 million estate, and don't have the money to campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors indicates that my program isn’t as interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are actually going to be covered by the senator's salary.
But with that money, I couldn’t live, for example, I couldn’t pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn’t be running anywhere.
Will you continue to be an entrepreneur so that you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut back on this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activity.
For example, the managing director of a travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would have liked me to be the silverless man who would keep the republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much do you, as an entrepreneur, earn per month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I continue to receive.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday edition of the Pravo newspaper.
MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Speikenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“To me, this building looks fun, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lisette Verheig, walking by the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a large company nearby, said: “No, this building is really beautiful.”
But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, no one volunteers to go to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Speikenisse, a little-known sleeping town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had only one chance to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Vinnie Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, a master of bold bar charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, took the task with his usual serenity and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury members looked around in confusion and shrugged their shoulders, the daring Maas folded from his original gift a pyramid in size and concluded his speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my suggestion: "Book Mountain" in Speikenissa, the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this 30-million-euro mountain has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the contest "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition of wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, a faceless suburb, which previously could offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, the white facades of which suggest a dairy, became richer on one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly - in Speikenissa appeared the first in the history of this town public cultural building.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression: a book Eldorado under the cheese cap.
There is only one elevator that passes in the center of the mountain range, because true fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glazed on all sides, the room is bright and easily visible, the floors of annealed bricks and elegant street lights unmistakably create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The look involuntarily looks for benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually, bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We put the classic configuration of space on its head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The inner space of the book mountain is skillfully used: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical premises.
Particularly delighted are black bookshelves, which serve as decoration of walls, then parapets, then stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and engineers are lost in guessing what this unknown material is.
“We were keen to work with secondary materials,” explains Jop Trauborst, project manager representing the Speikenisse community, in line with the standard’s requirements.
And one day, at an agrarian enterprise in Friesland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, an artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness is used as a substrate for the roots.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, after which it can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas – for the first time in such volumes – was compressed in a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a bit like a new car and a little sneakers.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Anyone who crosses a path almost 500 meters long will be rewarded in a literary café not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and tree ficuses in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
The cost of a new soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
For its heating and cooling, the heat of the earth is used.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun gets inside only for a short time.
Wide farms of glued wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig was already here.
Cynthia Bogard, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, called Buchenberg “the soul of Speikenisse that has long been missing.”
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from his own collection.
These books were supposed to occupy empty spaces on the shelves of the not yet fully staffed library - at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are upstairs.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Vini Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident is now somehow connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which in professional jargon is called identity creation.
Speikenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
This is only the starting point for identity building.
Szabo: "Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinians’ application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why? Hmm?
Szabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO made the offer.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely moving from the policy, which, so to speak, was managed by the United States, to the actual German foreign policy.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent single policy.
Once again, the Germans find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that so far they are only grasping their role, but are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
The kind of foreign policy that France or Britain pursues.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position in their national interests, independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are largely different from those of other major states, and Germany must therefore defend its own interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I wouldn’t give it too much importance, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relations with the US by abstaining from making important decisions such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe, and even in the United States, understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that she should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that her interests should be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, was clearly in favour of the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Due to American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, of course, the government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not at all as significant as it always seems.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of a major partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a unified, non-contradictory European policy, but this is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are instead forced to act on the basis of their own vision of the situation.
This is what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
This topic has always been sensitive.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take the lead?
Or is Germany still having a hard time leading the way?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German feelings are manifested.
The Germans can’t just deal with it.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It must take into account a wide variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the United States in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans have a bigger role to play.
Even if you do not like it, unpleasant or increases dislike for you - this is life!

“Trademark Protection” in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, and the Polo Ralph Lauren is.
What is the Armani Polo?
It is a completely official registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
It is unclear whether they will be able to uphold their rights.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a Taylor Wessing lawyer specializing in trademark infringement in the Far East.
On my desk every week there is a new case of this kind.
It is enough for imitators to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies, such as sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied in the same way.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the office of registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma there, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities, there are high-rise department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are not so. On behalf of his creditors, he opposes the fact that Chinese enterprises are fully officially received from the Trademark Office the right to use the name, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Ban Minpai", the passenger mark.
This word is associated with "ban daquan".
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
Chinese authorities plead not guilty
“It’s damaging to business, and it’s something that needs to be tackled,” Pattloch said.
“The trademark is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much.”
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest-growing luxury market with sales of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year.
However, getting rid of dubious entries in the Trademark Registry is difficult and costly.
The process can take up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed the lawsuits, because after a long time the contested name has become "the reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist, as he damaged his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled a BMW; the process was a success, and Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The Trademark Office of CTMO in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and equipment.
But last year there was a "return from an emergency in the workflow to normal".
Thus, the number of pending objection cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting it is expensive.
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth many times more to challenge it, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that their illegal production of counterfeit car parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
It was an omission of its own, as surnames are not protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the trademark registration agency CTMO rejected the claim of the Munich residents.
True, in both subsequent instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues to fight until now.
We need to be vigilant
The matter is currently pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes up a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs are scarcely accountable, the firm’s archives had to review even the records of a century ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing side a “big six-digit euro amount” for the settlement.
“From here it is clear how expensive it is for us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
That is, if imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this was able to prevent registration.
“We need to be vigilant,” says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark regulations, rather, foreigners should “all that is worth protecting in any way should also be registered in China,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the other party a royalty for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Sing, Sing and Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses – and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relationships that have traveled the distance of more than 8,733 kilometers.
First comes the relegation: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's slippers pick up the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
It is only after this that the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly grow - that they come, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his fabric shoes when he guides them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty participants of the choir from 23 to 69 years old, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor, came to the rehearsal.
"Om"Obani" is a difficult thing, each voice of the choir has its own text, besides in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS programme, there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitgeni, Voices for Africa has found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and daily hot lunch at the Gogo-center.
Imbongi in Zulu means storyteller or praiser.
They don't speak bantu fluently in this room, but they can sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even bringing them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Infected 40%
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, among the residents there are many children.
More than 300 of them lost their parents, who died from the virus.
In Esitjena, a miniature reflects the disease of the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth tens is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before Imbogni participants saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since taken almost professional care of AIDS orphans in Esitjen.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pulmonary pediculosis and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany result from sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections occur significantly more often than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25 years.
We also often have human papillomavirus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
In infectious diseases, there may be ulcers in the genital area, complaints when urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as bubbles or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, part of the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread by contact infection and with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid long-term consequences.
Chiefship, donations and, not least, the fees for choir performances throughout Germany allow you to collect something.
“In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estigny,” said Annete Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is managed by Two Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also ensures that the orphans are well-organized, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as the Zulu Old Women call it, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, given them a roof over their heads, and ensured that children in uniform showed up on time in class every day.
Those who have no relatives are taken to the shelter by Haniysil, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefer to be deeply silent.
The King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annete Lennartz, “because it is linked to sexuality.”
Quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Politics instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent years.
But it also lies with the wandering workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annete Lennartz, “but they’re hardly used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support cultural exchange, the Ibmogni Choir travels to southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in black - this recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads also to Esitjen, where the singers visit the underprivileged children.
Despite the fact that the small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the river Eculveni it is more than famous.
“Go to Esitjen, there is light,” the people here say.
And after an 8,733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also burning here.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The probe "Messenger" found evidence that the planet Mercury has ice.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The probe "Messenger" found evidence that the constantly shadowed region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid colliding with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, the spacecraft’s chief scientist.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Invisibly for the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, for example, "Phoenix", explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows in infinite distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
There are eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun after Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the 2006 new definition of the International Astronomical Union.
This snippet of the Spitzer infrared image represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify pink "newborn" stars in the stellar circle.
This region of star formation – scientists unromanticly call it W5 – was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This overflowing heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
A donut-like ring consists of material that the star has thrown away in the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, located 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic birthing hall.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the "Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, colors work better.
As a red eye winks at the observer, the snail nebula in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The resemblance to the terrestrial continent brought this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography ensures expressive color rendering.
This new star in all its glory was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came to be is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It could be the shards of Saturn’s moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: the galaxy of the Vortex
Depending on the color rendering, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
An image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (trinitarian, tripartite), since the dark bands of dust divide into three parts the hot heart of the cradle of the stars.
In the constellation Snakebearer, astronomers have photographed the forerunner of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of the two merging galaxies are colliding with each other and will inevitably collide.
This birth of the star was photographed by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn’t like technical cuts may call it the “Southern Pipe Wheel.”
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, consists of dust particles that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
The large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars – 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly luminous galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it arose shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgei, before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the spaces accessible to their eyes are deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
A large binocular telescope has been installed in Arizona, USA.
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the "Great South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented - to reduce the cost.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
Lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly bonded at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberley telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its peculiarity: high light-relevant ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the "Very Large Telescope" - fully corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow even the average infrared spectrum to be illuminated in the visual tube.
The European Very Large Telescope is also planned to be installed at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror should extend as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, also looks into the sky using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
Here you can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been delivering paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, primarily those that could contain life.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it should look for the Big Bang through the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists believe there is ice at Mercury’s south pole.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the "Messenger" orbits closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades indicated that Mercury has ice.
Thanks to the launch in 2004, the probe "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury - scientists are now sure of this.
Drink Butter Every Day and Live to 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically honorable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically honorable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus rolls with thunder along a winding road past densely forested hills, stormy rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you might think that you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak perfectly in Farsi and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by longevity.
The final point is Leric.
The small town boasts too heavy architecture of the Soviet times, which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost do not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tedious.
It takes 8 hours for 323 kilometers, since the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that in Lerik there is something to interest tourists.
"In May, Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will hold the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulaeva said.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented biography of about eight dozen talysh from these places, who are more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is Shirali Muslyumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And given the fact that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, was 122 years old, the age of Muslyumov seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did Muzlumov add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard about long-lived people in Central Asia.
“Surprisingly many elderly people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is not possible, since there were no civil status registers.
A glass of hot oil every day
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Lerick area astonishingly often reach the biblical age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years old living here.
Why are there so many long-lived people here in the south?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzade explains this by special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the Fatulayev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is about nutrition.
Talysh love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it a primitive way of life that keeps people young? In Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of butter, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Here, eight people live under the same roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
There are also two kids nearby.
The kitchen serves tea, which is served in typical crawling cups of Armoud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under her headscarf she hides long dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
“And I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought food in a store.
Then she tells about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after the Second World War.
But it got better when “beloved father” Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
Propaganda does not often sound in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took the reins.
However, there is no poverty among the elderly in Azerbaijan.
230 manats (approximately equal to the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions this is the amount on which you can live well.
And, perhaps, Mirzaeva’s long-grown son is also right: “The elderly in our culture are deeply respected.”
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is not included in the Constitution.
The revolution is back in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo show the country is deeply divided.
The future constitution, based on Sharia, met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not shy away from pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, feel fear.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily reduced the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and expanded his jurisdiction “to save the revolution.”
However, what the 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the American University of Southern California really wants to save is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were drawn in a nightly 15-hour obstacle course at an Islamist-minded 100-member constitutional assembly, and this is partly a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the proceedings are based on “principles of Islamic law”.
But what do you mean by "principles"?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that Islamists will use vague wording and the resulting legal luff for a more rigorous interpretation of the Sharia.
At least, this is hinted at by one new article: in all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamist institution with great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be brought to the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in a restriction of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, many things are subject to interpretation.
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians by a military court must be maintained.
These courts under Mubarak were used to suppress the opposition.
After the dictator was overthrown, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
According to the draft, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “maintain its morals and values”.
Legally, this is formulated so vaguely that state institutions will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature with the help of this article.
In plain text, this means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
But another forbids insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what offense is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that prohibits “insulting people” is also questionable.
Will there be enough caricatures of the president or jokes about the lawyer?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Morsi proposes to sign and which, according to him, “very soon” will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
“The revolution is back”
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the supremacy of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
“The revolution is back, and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution was “in the dustbin of history”.
Through Twitter, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to lead a “coup against democracy.”
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also said they did not want to watch the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for an opposing demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and Salafis who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Morsi: "Clean up the country!" and assured: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square where it all began provoked a state of virtually civil war.
Morsi’s followers obviously didn’t want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loud and clear.
Now it is time to let the people decide by the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
The majority for the Islamist project, it is considered a solved case.
“The term ‘human rights’ is never used.
Hafiz Abu Saeed is furious at this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi’s expansion into all three branches of government in the state is disappointing to the lawyer.
These measures are clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto abolished it,” Saeda said.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile directions with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There could be a payoff for that.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You are creating a monster you can’t control.”
Norwegian rakfisk: the worst smelling fish in the world?
Norway’s population of five million has one of the highest living standards not only in Europe, but worldwide.
Perhaps the secret of the success of this country is somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely mean fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get the smell of Rakfisk, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered picturesque views. It is very beautiful, but in the air spilled inexhaustible characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt and roamed in the water for up to a year, depending on what kind of sweet tooth you need to achieve.
As twilight thickens and cools, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this very, let’s say, exciting dish.
"It is eaten raw and sipped with a glass of aquavit, a local caraway vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time "Rakfisk general" who leads the festival.
All around us, people eat cut into small cubes of fish and drink it with considerable portions of alcohol.
“Somebody likes Aquavit better than Rakfisk,” says Howard.
This drink can break the odor.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - it is not much different from the portion of sushi that you took with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, the time of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish was soaked in hermetically sealed barrels with salt water in the autumn.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly fermented, it was extracted and, muffling the perception with alcohol, was eaten.
Thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who are attracted here by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a long-time rival, and not so long ago and much more prosperous neighbor) come massively here to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat stinking element of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here – a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you <0xC2><0xA3>9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most residents of the country seem to be satisfied with this.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called “the July 22 incident”.
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Norway’s current prosperity is based on the growth (since the early seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, who serves trays with aged Rakfisk, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, embodying Nordic well-being.
We are a people, as you call it, intelligent.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English very well.
We don't like to show off, we don't brag.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the revenues of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was wasting money they didn’t have, Norway was sparingly calculating all the costs.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there is Rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow waiting in line for some food - enough rakfiska with me.
Here's a hamburger with moose meat - it's certainly exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special dinner dedicated to rakfisk, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a live TV show showing the presenter in a butterfly tie, surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what rating did you get for the best fish out there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our estimate."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls out of a chair, possibly overwhelmed by an aquavit.
Or maybe just by smelling the fish.
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has a tough start to his career.
As Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to take a look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of his country’s population.
Traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly deplorable state.
This city is overloaded with traffic and at its best, and since Monday, steel barriers have been erected, cutting off several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential bandage and take the reins of the country.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderon, which is now relinquishing its power, but the country is plunged into a war against drugs, which has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the White House’s Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before such statements, next to the US President, Mr. Peña Nieto’s political career developed as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the country’s capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Straight-linear man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents are credited with revitalizing tourism, developing the resort sector and creating infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with holes and pits that were previously at this place.
His name tags hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We have hopes for real and serious change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from the Peña Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country so urgently needs, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he denies the accusations of insubordination made by the opposition to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very dedicated to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under highway overpasses, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in nature of this metropolis.
Troops had been mobilized earlier this year to tame drug-trafficking gangs in those areas; violence against women was particularly acute.
Several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the emptiness near an extensive landfill in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico State during the governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto, a figure that far exceeds that of the infamous city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become commonplace when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto ' s opponents, at best, he had failed to address the problem of women ' s murder during his tenure as governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house similar to most of the houses in this decayed area, Irineja Buendía struggles to hold back her tears by showing me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her roommate.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before,” Buendía recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was already rigid.
Mariana’s mother retells the story, and the portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifix, on which only one word is inscribed: justice.
This, they said, was denied to the family.
“State officials treated me like an old gossip girl, a disgruntled disturber.
They just want people to believe everything they say and keep quiet.
But this is wrong, this is not possible, especially when there are so many violations and deficiencies around," she says.
Wearing the presidential bandage on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence-related crimes, and the new president has promised to make addressing the problem a priority during his reign.
“I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was a governor,” says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, the prosecution says.
Prosecutors are trying to disprove Bradley Manning's allegations of poor detention conditions.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning ' s stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's detention conditions were cruel.
A US soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, charged with the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of multiple opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had endured while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, stated that the records of Manning’s weekly visits by prison officials during the nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of Manning’s motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment was conducted the day after Manning stated that while in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published online on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday’s hearing, Prosecutor Fein and Manning reviewed reports that were filled out after Manning’s visits by administration officials during his stay at Quantico Prison, where he was held under strict detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the prison administration’s treatment of himself as “excellent” and the general conditions of the detention as “very professionally organized.”
The reports in question do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being directly questioned about his conditions, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concerns about these issues and that the administrations visiting him had discussed these issues with him and stated that they would be addressed, but had not recorded this in writing.
“They were recording ‘there are no problems’ (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn’t mean I didn’t bring up the topic in the conversation,” Manning said.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of a commission examining suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during the meeting he wanted to get rid of the “injury prevention” regime and to ease the conditions of imprisonment.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that a limited regime of detention - a level lower than the surveillance regime to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that I’m okay so they can cancel the injury prevention regime... so that my standard of living improves, from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait, and that he had once lost consciousness due to the intense heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is decided and what is happening in the outside world.
“My world has shrunk to Camp Arifjan base, to the size of my prison,” Manning said.
“I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning said, he spent most of his time in a small cell – at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day – alone.
Manning says he was only allowed to leave a mattress, a blanket, slippers, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says that he tried to move, as sleeping or even just lying down during the daytime prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly hit in the eyes by light penetrating from the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned over in bed at night, he said he was woken up and forced to turn over on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about a statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates for a morning check.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Answering the judge’s questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard’s order that he should throw a blanket he could cover himself with, but admitted that no one had explicitly ordered him to throw it.
Manning said Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could have used a rubber band or slippers to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from the cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to endure during his detention and significantly shorten the length of his detention if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is due to begin hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning a plea for less serious crimes and challenge other allegations as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico under the rules governing the detention of those arrested under the strictest possible regime.
The charges brought against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally facilitating the release of data on the Internet, the transfer of information related to national defense, and the theft of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American descent are torn between the two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrivals corridor, approached the border control zone and froze on the spot.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and have been called Mexican all my life.
It’s just a conventional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish and my friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later, I focused on the complex construction of the "American of Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather’s homeland, there was no need for conventional names or elaborate designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I got my American passport and made the queue for the Extranjeros.
I recalled that story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto happily spoke of a boom in the Mexican economy that would allow Mexicans to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a kind of North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old-fashioned issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and, under the gun, forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think in centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only necessary for any U.S. statesman to say even a word of criticism to Mexico, the press and the elite of Mexican society immediately hear complaints that Americans infringe on the sovereignty of neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with belligerence.
The most difficult is Mexico’s relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about insults?
Enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country, and those for whom such opportunities do not exist.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent for one reason only: at some point in their family history, anyone - father or grandfather - had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often it was Mexicans of a certain type - brown, undereducated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of the American dream, we went to good schools and got good jobs, but we must not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider as our own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We respond to them the same way.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as untrue Mexicans.
We don’t speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico aren’t strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Americans of Mexican origin are offended by this.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship is already insufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to serve as Mexico’s ambassadors and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too many insults in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, the rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but you deal with it, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent are still resentful of how their relatives were treated in Mexico more recently.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
The old battles in the new Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace.
Is a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed leads to a conclusion about the futility of such hopes.
There is a familiar, senseless debate about who started it; many buildings have been turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and for the first time since the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly stuck in their eternal conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have circled in a rebellious storm many established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis have not managed to stay away from the vortex that shook the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, will be implemented, the clashes this week only strengthened the positions of security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will say that they forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group’s leaders were killed and 1.7 million residents trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by a more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and wealthy friends.
The resurgent regional leader, Turkey, once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim nations, has come out with support for Hamas; Qatar, one of the wealthiest and most dynamic Gulf states, has followed suit.
Triumphing Hamas supporters are claiming to have created an Islamist crescent around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, ruled by Hezbollah’s paramilitary group, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king’s power is threatened by Hamas allies.
The most significant shift in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened under President Mohammed Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay much attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is an organization much like Hamas, and its leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic settings, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of Hamas’s missiles.
Citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the US has remained true to its unchanged position; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the start of the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that about 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part due to the wall that enters the West Bank - a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects such actions from international settlements, which continue to expand.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the January 22 elections, has teamed up with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What’s the point of giving the Palestinians a state of their own?
If all power in the West Bank is given to them, will they not launch rockets into Israel from there, as their fellow Israelis do in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and rigidly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
The hardliners may be victorious; however, their calculations may be refuted by the Arab Spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be domestic problems.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Unleashing a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Mursi, who has worked with Barack Obama on the ceasefire, is a good sign and may mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, no less, take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes in the Arab countries occur, the deprivation of Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic dimension – the growth of the Arab population – only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas have to be paid for by the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need external impulses.
The only solution that remains, which is constantly called for by sensible representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two states and Israel's concession of territories in exchange for security.
There remains a hope, not too impressive in the short term, that a ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long since decided to cut off arms shipments to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, are more than ever in a position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of a virtual Palestinian state.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he continues to show reluctance to get involved in solving the problem.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible if there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on unified packaging for cigarettes has come into force.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of affected parts of the body contrast on the sad green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world, the Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color design of different brands with the same box of sad-olive color with eerie pictures of affected parts of the body and images of children whose health is undermined by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs introduced mandatory from this Saturday is the names of the stamps, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for the design of packaging of tobacco products.
The Australian federal government says the goal of the measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this bad habit of fashion status.
The study found that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 never smoked in 99 out of 100 cases.
“It is obvious that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging,” explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so these changes will not have much impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will have serious consequences other than those conceived by its initiators,” said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of the small family-owned Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for cigarettes and silicone cases hiding nasty pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco tried and lost the case.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesalers and is expecting a new batch.
This is a good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
After Australia passed a number of laws that made television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sporting events illegal, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from placing ads online, but it cannot restrict foreign websites from doing so.
“If you’re a tobacco trader and you’re left with just that little loophole, you’ll find the idea of promoting your product online extremely tempting,” explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of trademark reviews written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the work of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spared no effort and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind this?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states are making claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government has been discussing with other countries the possibility of enacting similar laws on packaging.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to make it mandatory to post photographs warning of the dangers of smoking.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening the laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstratively disobedient to innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
“You just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket,” explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of the oral tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in downtown Sydney, claims that the same packaging has made it difficult to place goods on the shelves.
“I used to take an hour to unload a new batch, and now four hours,” he complains.
“The government should have taken and banned cigarettes altogether, then we would have said: what to do, okay, it’s over, we close the store,” he said, throwing his hands up.
Being bored in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving day, I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had a mechanical malfunction and was replaced with another plane, which we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to reflect on the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for the flight is really boring, and neither books, nor magazines, nor iPhones, nor even duty-free stores will help much.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and specialists in child development have spoken in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss is not so bad.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should strive for boredom?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
“In fact, boredom has a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century.
The question remains as to how we understand boredom.
The problem, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, is that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After reviewing research materials on the subject and asking a 100-person target group a question, Professor Eastwood and colleagues came up with the following definition: Boredom is when people “want but can’t do what would satisfy them.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn’t do something they’d like to do.
With apathy, you don’t want to do anything.
The core of boredom, he says, is “disruption of attention and the associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is slow.”
The description of boredom can seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel bored when it’s really hard to focus on something.
In his study, “Unoccupied Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues cite an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a recording of a voice reading the journal.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of a non-relevant television program turned on in the next room, others heard the same sounds at a low volume, so that they could hardly be disassembled, and the third group listened only to the recording of a voice without an outside soundtrack.
Those participants who heard the low-loud television said they were bored, more often than others - they found it difficult to concentrate, but they didn't know the reason for it and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, looking at the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help to avoid boredom.”
It is believed that when people begin to swing on a chair or draw scribbles on a piece of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that such actions simply help not to relax physically.
"The study showed that children who are not forbidden to swing and spin learn better and memorize more information than children who are required to sit quietly," says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all feel bored: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show varying degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “boring tendency scale” to measure such individual features.
Questions and statements are used to determine the rating on such a scale, for example, "Many of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I am interested in too much, so there is no time for anything."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys miss girls more often, - says Stephen Wodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida - especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day via a pager.
The results were as follows: 32% of teens said they were bored at school and while doing homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data on boredom would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “teenagers are at the peak of boredom,” mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Back to my original question: Is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations, research shows, it can push people to absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling or substance abuse in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has devoted more than two decades to the study of this problem.
“So our brains tell us to do something else; that’s boredom,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this same brain does not always know what exactly is best to do.
If you get bored and you focus that energy on playing the guitar or cooking experiences, you will do better for yourself.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will cease to be bored, but he will not learn to cope with boredom on his own or in any other way to manage his time and employment, - says Professor Fenske.
“Such self-regulation skills are used in a variety of situations,” he argues.
Your child is not only learning to do something on their own, he is also learning self-control in general.
I don't think boredom should be praised.
However, it is not worth considering it as something bad either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of activities and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“We see it as something that we need to get bored more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
“In today’s world, we are accustomed to the constant overstimulation of the senses,” he says, “and when silence comes, we get lost and don’t know what to do.”
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will be applied
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old football team player and student at a community college in southeastern Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offense that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco says that one September he and his friends were in Lamar driving a car along the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer discovered marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and possession of a device for drug use - minor offences for which a fine of $100 was owed - and a trial date was set.
“We are treated like criminals,” says Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law, but on the place of consideration.
Charges of minor marijuana offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has taken a similar measure.
Police departments have already stopped charging people aged 21 and over for storing low doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law comes into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to review existing marijuana cases and continue to prosecute the possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West voted to prevent the emergence of new, state-licensed stores selling marijuana in their places.
“It’s all happening so fast that I don’t know what to expect next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of the regulatory bodies in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads in confusion.
They have to form rules to determine the licensing procedure for the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in regulating marijuana use, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
“There’s a more streamlined market in Colorado, so they’ll set a good example,” explains Brian E. Smith, a representative of the Council for the Regulation of the Production and Sales of Alcohol in Washington.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than put forward some proposals and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent to follow,” he said.
The Washington state bill, dubbed I-502, will go into effect on December 6 and plunge the state into a state of uncertainty for a year when the state licensing system is not yet in place and marijuana ownership is already legal.
But there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's order to "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on its trade at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses within cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly formed Marijuana Legalization Center.
On November 21, police chief Oates of Aurora emailed his subordinates that the city’s prosecutor’s office would no longer hold people over the age of 21 responsible for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that police would stop indicting people for those violations “from now on.”
Chief Oates said the police would monitor the city’s regulations governing medical marijuana growers and would prosecute illicit drug traffickers and distributors.
Weld County Attorney in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is taking a more rigorous approach to the matter.
After the vote on the bill, he said prosecutors would continue to prosecute possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 individuals are charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many are accused of other violations.
"It is the duty of our institution to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time they are committed," Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places like the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The police of Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer hold adults accountable for possession of a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop the charges in the already open cases related to marijuana possession.
“I believe that enforcing the law until it changes is our direct duty,” he said.
While 55% of Colorado voters supported the decision, incorporating marijuana use for entertainment into the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the controversial reaction of residents in different parts of the state exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state experiment with marijuana.
“The district attorneys have a cultural barrier to this,” explains Sean McAllister, a Denver-based lawyer representing convicts of marijuana possession and a local representative of the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They’ve harassed people for so long that they can’t really put up with the fact that it’s no longer a crime,” he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana in the same way as alcohol, are destined to become a country-wide experimental field to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are wary of instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope that the Justice Department will yield in this matter.
Despite several high-profile arrests of drug traffickers and medical marijuana users, the federal government has in most cases approved medical marijuana trafficking in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Drug Enforcement Office agents are unlikely to break into homes to seize a small package of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, says Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the action of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores, which would not have been able to open sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position where we give someone a license and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
The city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I survived Oxford for being a Conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I’ve always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of the ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization - freethinking and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the history faculty of the Worcester College of Oxford in the late eighties, I packed my suitcases and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I had left because I had to drink from the squeezed cups.
It wasn't really that much fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran because I was being systematically poisoned and bullied.
Not at all because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to a private school.
I was poisoned for one reason only, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it seemed true barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You may ask, why remember this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students who adhere to center-right views are subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that granted to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the Corpus Christi College student club in Cambridge say they are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel like unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the college’s Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only aggravated by the recently released BBC 2 documentary on student politics, Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right, in which conservatives were portrayed as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film features Joe Cook, former president of the Conservative Association of Oxford University, who rides in a Rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver cap.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made "goats for higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Conservative Association of the University of Nottingham, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that “in the university environment, the bias towards left-wing views is increasing.
People who don’t even know us think we are impudent and impunity-ridden children of rich parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a college history student at Corpus Christi College who has filed a request for increased protection, calls the atmosphere “uncomfortable,” and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Conservative Association at Oxford University, says the student club’s attitude toward center-right viewers has deteriorated significantly.
“This poses a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of the club members,” she said.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a shy and shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford was in a frenzy of hatred for the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to budget cuts to higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the freshman week, when students get to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time what was ahead of me.
I did not know that the teachers not only looked over their fingers at the harassment of conservative students, but also gladly took part in it.
Political issues—miners’ strike, privatization, and the government’s disagreement to impose sanctions on the apartheid government in South Africa—were sweeping through the paneled walls of the auditorium.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the professor, now deceased Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was difficult for me, I was stunned.
Harry Pitt was a very bile-like person with a cake-like face.
"Thatcherists don't teach French in principle, or they just don't have the brains?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
There were tears in my eyes.
“I would advise you to take a few basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you’re very busy revolving around society,” Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I was sitting alone for lunch; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the faculty of English, who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Association of the University.
“I know who you are,” he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of being sympathetic to the Conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be harder for you.
Most Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.”
Later, in the local pub, I cowardly tried to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I didn’t agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick failed.
A first-year student of the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contagious.”
The other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
“How do conservatives have sex?” one of them asked.
- They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the abolition of criminal prosecution in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour leader and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years began to seem like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only professor in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for being Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of its speechwriters.
He barely showed up for college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettiness, and adherence to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased friends of the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, all political views were accepted there.
“But it’s the best university in the world,” he said.
- They can't do that, except in a city of dormant spires...
Even my communist friends have always behaved flawlessly.”
His wet eyes blurred.
“Don’t make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you quit college."
I was exhausted by my constant travels to London and my emotional defenses were weakening.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
The following week, during a seminar, when another history teacher called me the “enemy of the people” quite seriously, I decided to do the same.
In my heart, burning with shame, I confessed that “my parents brainwashed me” and called them “old fools.”
The respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin cover of my career in Oxford was destined to nail my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I did not go out, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a weeping and a rag.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
All the more sad that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory"
About the exhibition "Valentino: master of sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemitz and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of “Valentino: Master of Sewing”, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his “home” over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "il señore" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his eminent clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
The first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, abounds with personal letters and photographs signed by the most eminent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a modest tailor from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "elite".
Being in love with the royal court is not a bad thing.
“At least they’re not extinguishing their cigarettes on your gorgeous carpet like some great pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemitz.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved coming to his chalet in Gstaad,” explains Heini’s ex-wife Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza remembers the charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to his house for dinner, it was after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style manifested itself in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her decor, in food, in music.
“Each of Valentino’s guests made him feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model” whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the Paris Fashion Week.
“He never goes out of style because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
Pedigree Parade
The life of Garawani is not a story of obsessions, but of falling in love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of the Somerset House of somersaults was transformed into a glamourous podium of sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade on the podium, contemplating the "spectators" of the dreams that shine in the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Ardaud Kennedy chose for his wedding.
In this audience, such names as Sibylle of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sophia Habsburg shine from the models.
Nati Abascal and fashion designer, 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino’s first love is “impossible to forget.”
I remember him perfectly.
These were trousers, a shirt, a "vest" and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Nati Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria added.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they “fit” into his face.
The proportions are ideal.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also can not forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets.
That time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it for a holiday in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with curls, "corsage" in the fold and a neckline without straps.
“It was a dream that came true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from the fashion designer with "extreme caution ... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories accompanying it."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seams) to make this outfit of ivory silk with an inlay of pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and a four-and-a-half-meter plume.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone of high fashion of the end of the 20th century, "the return of clients from the higher world."
Overwhelmed by the elite’s “lifestyle” for many years, Valentino himself is now the elite’s best representative.
Knight of the Grand Cross (an insignia of the highest rank in Italy), Knight of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He sat at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was impeccable, time does not exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: miners from Kawah-Ijena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano along steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living mining sulfur in the Kawah-Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfur gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes in contact with air.
He cuts off huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, rolls the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up the cliffed rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters high, only 250 meters, however, exhausted loaders need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle step, with difficulty keeping balance and carefully tapping the road, so as not to stumble and fall from the cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to one tourist from France who fell from the cliffs of Kawah-Ijena a few years ago.
Kawah-Ijena miners earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once upstairs, they pave their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, weary of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales, which the mining company has placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
We are talking about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemicals, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since the norm is carrying 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily carry-overs.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems miserable for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
"The daily fee for miners is very high by local standards, where the coffee collection is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the loader, who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason that in Indonesia is as crushing as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where only Hindus took Yavu, and brought her home."
Anto has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes are tearful due to toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah-Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, he coughs constantly, and his eyes are tearing because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promised in more than acceptable English.
Punished with life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter, or hotel porter, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at 2:00 a.m. because the sulfur does not stop flowing out at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Challenged by the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating his path with a small lantern connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 porters drag baskets with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don’t even get part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photo fee, which, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entry ticket, the reserve’s guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mule people.
“It’s a job for cattle, not for people,” said Badrusin, a 42-year-old rooted bearer who has spent three decades in Kawah-Ijena since leaving college.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will tolerate the job “as much as he can” because he needs money to educate his three children aged 18 to 10.
I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here, because volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains of their serious illnesses... more serious, apparently, than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pains and sores on the shoulders, which are more severe than the ulcers on the shoulders.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades take 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, covering a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the thickets.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here, because the volcano is my whole life,” Unaynik said, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what human mules from Kawah-Ijena do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and housing and education prices for the absence of children.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, let's do our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem unbelievable that these lines are part of a mint cake ad, but despite this — or perhaps because of it — this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put a bao (bride) in the stove" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do “their national duty.”
This thing is purely for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing our kind, so we felt that this is the topic we should touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing quick-dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, namely, rap?
1.2 children
Who doesn’t take this lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and provides tax breaks.
All of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and its strict public control.
Singapore ' s fertility rate, according to its national population authority, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 – known as a replacement percentage – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Department of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Administration, says the reason is “improved education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities beyond getting married and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and childbirths, resulting in lower birth rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies, which aim to dramatically increase immigration to counteract declining populations, are causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where scarcely hidden xenophobia thrives against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and unwilling to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party scored the worst election result since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem, through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in fertility has a known impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenses, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also starting to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so many small dwellings.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development guide has shifted to controlling the number of small apartments known as “shoe boxes” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments with an area of 46 square meters sell very well.
However, there is an opinion that they can promote a single lifestyle and deprive the incentive of developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yoo Sun, CEO of homebuilder EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” sell much faster than the more spacious ones.
They are more popular in the sense that such apartments are sold out for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flow increases.
However, he acknowledges that the new norms provide clearer guidelines for developers who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overstretched
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the center’s financial quarter, they don’t seem to have much effect.
“People are very stressed out, housing is expensive, as is education, and because of this, many people put it off,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another young man, 20 years old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, the Singaporeans have the final say in terms of procreation.
Personal in offline - personal in online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a property of private or "the sphere of private life, which they have the right to protect against any interference".
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social media?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when discussing situations on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” in a personal way, and “password and username,” when they applied it to social media.
“My biggest secrets I wouldn’t upload to a post,” Jorge, 10, says as he tries to explain the importance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he’s had accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or someone who was acting stupid,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish obscene photos of naked people, crimes or write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they’re answering me, I’m just uploading them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” he says.
Without hesitation, he answers that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't consider someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he does not know the 20 people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one rubbed into his trust and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
“If I’m pressured or demanded, I’ll just delete them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experience of what is known today as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Just turned on confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps to set up an account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I didn’t like the person or if I wanted to.
“Although I know it’s cybermobbing,” he confirms.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and education and training specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a means of finding information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she said.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are they, the children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
“We’re digital immigrants who have to teach them while we’re still learning,” she says.
He explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken at an age where maturity is not enough for it.”
“Also to make them selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or would you like it if they published a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign party photos, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they need to behave online in the same way they do offline.
The same rules.
“Outside of the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, so should social media,” she argues.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for heads of families to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an online account.
“For example, the age and what is allowed to be distributed or published,” he says.
According to Gaurdi, the key question is to remind children of the lesson “do not talk to strangers”.
UNASUR summit ends without the release of the Lima Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven obligatory participants.
Efe repeatedly attempted to gain access to the document signed at the sixth regular meeting of the Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the homepage that it would be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that at some point it would be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the contents were presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit has been restricted at all times.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without a sound with the message "closed session, no sound".
The little information that circulated among the reporters was provided by the spokespersons of some UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not the Peruvian one.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, sparking outrage from hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian presidential administration sent an e-mail to the media with the summit’s “final declaration”, but this is a statement by Umala, and not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and at that time, despite the press’s insistence, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not circulated.
On the official ASPA website, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but limited as much as possible the receipt of information.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice, which begins Monday in The Hague hearing statements from both sides, as part of the charge that Lima has brought against Santiago.
“We will respect and enforce a decision that will clarify the differences we are currently presenting to this international court,” said Umala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international tribunals,” Piñera added, welcoming Umala’s handshake against the backdrop of the two countries’ flags.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would obey the International Court of Justice came immediately after Colombia protested this week against the Bogota Pact, under which it recognized submission to the verdicts of that international court following the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it deemed erroneous.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president, Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit just after noon Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and the directions of action for 31 projects among South American countries were approved, the amount of the proposed investments amounted to $ 17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the agreements on the place of residence".
He said that actions are being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizens’ insecurity and against organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, inexpensive access to the Internet in all corners of South America and taking into account the combined and effective risk of natural disasters.”
As Europe is in crisis, “the economic union (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our productive base and anticipate a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve connectivity in South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five were Peru-bound and bounded by transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a greater link with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, before embarking on a regional meeting, said he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to hold respectful talks on the maritime dispute as a result of an international court verdict challenged by Bogotá.
“The day after tomorrow (Saturday) I may meet with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua,” he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
At the summit, the bloc’s defense ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the issue of protecting the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter’s participation has been suspended.
Peru holds the interim presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe.”
Correa, who took part in the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and other clashes, "but now they are practically the same homeland."
He defended, in this context, a project to establish South American citizenship, which is endorsed by the UNASUR member countries.
“We need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to take us back in time,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also shown himself a supporter of the renewed Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose Pact on human rights.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, hinting at Ecuador's grant of political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because with it he did not betray his principles, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that at one time “there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be followed.”
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding to come to his territory for questioning on the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law itself considers it possible to carry it out by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London”.
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating Assange’s physical and mental health.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious,” he said.
What it really is, is the danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health due to imprisonment in a small space without the ability to do exercises in the air.
“It affects the health of any person,” he added.
Correa pointed out that a solution to the asylum issue granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorean embassy in London through the provision of a security guarantee that would allow him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there have been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating on human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garzón, is conducting a number of trials in various European bodies," he said.
He said: “If the UK gives us a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will be over.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows it and as it has done on other occasions, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, tomorrow the problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to show himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he does not tolerate “mediumliness, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
“The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt political villains, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he was pleased that neither these journalists, “neither the bankers nor the bourgeois hegemonic countries dominate Ecuador,” and added that being re-elected “will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay’s veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization “should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of legality” because in fact “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy”.
The Ecuadorian president also considered the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to hold talks with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries as a result of the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which proved in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty, to be “fully justified”.
This decision is not being respected at the moment.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to process them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime borders, which is in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that “it is right for Latin America to appeal to the international authorities, if the two countries undertake to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be”.
Regarding the possibility of running as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he is considering this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to acknowledge that responsibility,” he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had gone for treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean that President Chávez’s health is deteriorating,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that his AIDS test had come back positive.
“I feel like I’ve been stunned,” he recalls that difficult moment, despite all the tact of the doctor.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn as much about it as possible. And his efforts were realized - he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients in the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994, having overcome many obstacles.
He has been diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would have been hard to believe that there were too few treatment options, too little knowledge about the disease, too much bias towards patients.
Even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, “because he had a cut”.
In other words, in those days, having AIDS was a verdict.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so without compromising the quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, still many people come when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time, and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV department of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva.
HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depends on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients have at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs.
Simply put, the above means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "by maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been reported by May this year; however, there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still fatalities?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how things are at our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late because they are not aware of their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a massive scale, for all people who ask.”
In his proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA) agree, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabricio, who applied for a test in a private laboratory, prompted only by the fact that his friend did it and, despite his young age, he was ill.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and don’t want to know.
"If I'm going to die anyway, I'd rather get pumped three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercise, take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he has had cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
“I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person,” Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, said in a statement.
Let them be checked if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, so it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health care programs and the common citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has tackled the HIV-related issue.
The biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, “in fact, the distribution of condoms has increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of a hundred, and that’s very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to a condom,” he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you need them?" is a popular question, with venom and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; so that condoms are not only behind the counters and that hundreds of them are in vending machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
This is not encouragement of debauchery.
It's not about paying for beer and a motel, Governor Emilio González said when asked if condoms could be distributed under his leadership.
“It’s not sexuality, it’s best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There were 13,435 total cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and total AIDS cases and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are related to the sexual pathway, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people for one reported case who do not know about it.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision annulling the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of firms, which are allowed by Mexican laws, are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of Judge Harlene Hale’s decision on June 15 in the bankruptcy court of the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
The ruling, however, opens the door to a leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies as evidence.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says the main proceedings concern competitive proceedings pending in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, the UN Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, designating the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without intercompany voting, the critically recognised debts of the Vitro branches to the parent company would not have reached the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts are guaranteed by the Federal Institute for Competitive Proceedings.
It is also true that subtracting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, who fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely the "vultures" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation that it has faced since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis that has overtaken the United States, hitting the country.
So far, the González Sáda family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote reaches its plenary, that is, five judges, in view of the fact that only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for certification will be filed, which will require a review of the process by the highest court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae (“friend of the court”), which describes the process that Vitro follows under the Competition Act, signaling that it exempts itself from complying with agreements signed by both countries to link it to section 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is, the rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambola from two sides: they hit the Vitro and hit the country.
Total balance
Given the months-long complaints placed on the table by Mexicana de Aviación’s trade unions against the company’s former owner, Gastón Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Aircraft Pilots’ Union Association has already found the bottle neck.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino, has just filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to submit reports to the Prosecutor General of the Republic regarding the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw from the trust fund F/589 of IXE Bank 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
Meeting at the Caribbean University Forum over the weekend, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean countries of products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces that razed part of the protected areas and pose serious threats to the industry.
Death of Acta
Regarding the Senate’s rejected request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as the abbreviation of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been transferred to the archives.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of considering it as violating freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, home developer Homex places 500 million pesos of stock certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical ones, with an offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitors are coming into the world

Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The avid basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And after all, before a brain hemorrhage chained him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes had been immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a minor player, a Major League Baseball player, commissioner and head of BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys, and president of the Basketball Federation.
“I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, president of the National Team and president of the federation in the 1990s,” Reyes recalls during Primera Hora’s visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife, for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected over his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamonet in the Heart
With the greatest emotion he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
“These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There have been many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsey made his debut on BSN.
From that moment on, Cuco Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over,” Reyes said.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, telling me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"Do you want?"
And that was the start of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who obtained citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincy had brought the championship to Bayamón, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the championship Cowboys with Gauss, but at a distance, because by 1988 he was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and Mincy’s achievements in the national team.
I remember the first time we won against the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place and it should have been bronze, if not for that Canadian referee who forced us to overplay the final game, Reyes said.
Is that team from the 1990 World Cup the best team you’ve ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was from the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
That team not only again played Mincy, Gauss, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and Piculina (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) 'Toñito' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quijote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 due to injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic qualifying tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily suspended for a mess in the Pan American Championship of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Pikulin did.
This is without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a very difficult question.
We had a very good youngster, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From a young age, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you consider to be your greatest achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s BSN had up to 17 teams per season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, for Ponce boys to play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it’s superfluous.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and coursework for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he portrayed a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TV series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday evening of complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas production studio.
“Larry is back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the iconic role he loved the most,” his family said in a statement.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at the Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman became famous on television for his decent-looking role in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he plays Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie girl played by Barbara Eden and begins to live with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character in two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, The Good Life (NBC, 1971–72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well-received by critics in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who Shot J.R.?", designed to create a buzz around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, spawned international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked in bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at the time.
When the response was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million TV viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second most watched entertainment program in history, following the 1983 finale of Mash, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn’t leave town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be put in treatment.
“I know what should be on J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, "Here rests the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
That's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Princepal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of “Dallas” were shown a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT.
Five episodes of the second season have already been recorded and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the series after Hagman’s departure.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s and then served in the English Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he wrote a memoir titled Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales About My Life.
“I didn’t include anything that I thought was capable of hurting anyone or affecting them in any way,” he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After the liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery, and afterwards,” he said.
I’m trying to offer some comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it’s going to be a little awkward for a short time, but you’re going to be fine.”
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course that explores "The End of the World" begins
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmey decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible bait: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long countdown” on December 21, which many people grabbed as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the “long armageddon,” and the growing conflict that Israel will be drawn into, a place where Christian end-time theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Charme told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world now, as if we only had 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on "the end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Wacker teaches the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World”.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios that trigger certain human actions are proposed.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I tried to tell students what is possible, probably plausible and impossible,” Wacker said.
At the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Matthew Restall, a professor of Latin American history, and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read a course called simply “The End of the World.”
"We're not adding '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite “imminent destruction,” students must learn, prepare projects, and pass final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“Places ended in two hours,” Restall said of his high-average student course, which enrolled 35 students.
We received emails for many weeks before the semester from people asking if there were more seats.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves,” said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at the Department of Religion and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or lack of it.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old student at the Department of Psychology and Nursing, said he had watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a course that teaches that,” he said.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed — not to mention the professor — said they believed in the December 21st end of the world date.
“Our first project touched on the Mayan prophecy, and we kind of discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final-year student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that spans several centuries, where people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The internet has fueled this speculation.
“In other places, people don’t think about it,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew of any course about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines is not taking part in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at the order of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time there had been talk of many days of judgment, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and faculty carelessly refer to this date.
Some said they were going to the end of the world parties.
“Maybe I’ll call one of my friends and laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
