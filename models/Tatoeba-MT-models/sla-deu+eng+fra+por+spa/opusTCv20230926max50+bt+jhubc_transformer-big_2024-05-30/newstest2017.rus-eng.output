28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, noting, "Finally, things were going well for him."
"The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galizia," the San Francisco Forensic Bureau said in a statement.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Luis Galizia, told San Francisco-based ABC’s KGO that Frank, a former Boston line chef, got his dream job as a cook at San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and depressed" by his death.
“We are a small team that works as a close-knit family and will be greatly missed,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that Frank first stayed in hostels, but recently "Finally, things were going well for him."
“He found an apartment, he was dating a girl,” Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to cook us some dish, to cook us dinner,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in a fight.
He was a brother who was floating.
“With all the bad things that are happening to this world, it was that uncut diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.

Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
An international group of biologists has come to the conclusion that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the lens of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five meters long, can be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a low metabolism plays an important role in shark longevity, which leads to slow development.
Female Greenland sharks only reach sexual maturity by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the longest life of all vertebrate animals lives "neighbor" of the shark - Greenland whale.
The oldest specimen known to scientists was just over 210 years old.

Should I go to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
We need sanatorium and resort rest not only for the treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In the conditions of a sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and get recommendations from a doctor on how to live so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, you should not shy away from it.
Constant stress, mental and physical overwork can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And stress is experienced by about 90% of the visitors.
And people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55 are most susceptible to it.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself a rest in time.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend a vacation with your kids, you won’t have to part with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health programs, which include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultation, tests and medical.
For example, swimming (many sanatoriums have children's pools), inhalations, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physical therapy.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account the individual indications and features of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children's club with animators, where children can attend play classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide the necessary conditions for infants and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
The mild winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days a year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round rest in the resorts of Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium-resort treatment is desirable to conduct 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main feature of the region of the Caucasian Mineral Waters, of course, healing mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various systems of the body.
Water differs in temperature, amount of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects the water depending on the patient's well-being.
Thus, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki Nova" has anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effects.
The same effects have the water "Slavianovskaya".
When prescribing water, the doctor necessarily takes into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water because the salts retain the liquid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now in sanatoriums are available and various cosmetic procedures for the face and body.
What types of healing, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, mud from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, resorption, immunomodulatory effect.
These are wellness walks along individually designed routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the mineral spring "Narzan".
There you can also take wine, pearl, iodine, selenium, sage-lacric baths, depending on what your doctor prescribes.
Prolong the fruiting.
What can we do to keep the harvest going until the end of the season?
Tells Yulia Belopukhova, agronomist and daughter-in-law.
It is time for tall tomatoes to arrange a haircut: remove new stepchildren, cut the tops, remove all the leaves until the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small ovaries - they will not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with ash-superphosphate extract, treated with biopreparations (ripener - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from diseases, immunocytophyte, immunocytophyte, immunophyte).
Of the chemicals at the end of summer, it is worth using only copper sulfate, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We do the last watering of the plants.
Long-breasted cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the wallpaper so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, watered with warm water and a solution of Zircon, sprinkle the stem with 5-7 cm of compost.
To prolong the fruiting of zucchini is also easy: cut the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against the night cold, install arcs with a covering material over the bed.
Keep the plants open during the day and close after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What shows that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to analysts polled by Bloomberg, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive dynamics - in the second quarter of GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest Rosstat data, the recession of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The stabilization of the situation was also recently announced by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development.
There is slow growth ahead.
According to CBR experts, the recession in the Russian economy is a thing of the past.
“The index estimate of Russia’s GDP indicates that the recession is behind and slow economic growth is ahead,” the Bank of Russia’s Bulletin “What Trends Are Saying” reads.
The regulator’s modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter was increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of economic development, during the second quarter, the decline in Russian GDP stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted GDP decline was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15”, – quotes the representative of the MAYOR of RIA Novosti.
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that “the bottom has been passed”.
Among other markers pointing to signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth of demand for electricity and rail transportation, the revival of business.
Adjusting to the fact that the year is leap year, it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this the lower annual average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the half-yearly volume can also be explained by seasonality, "explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, reducing price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstat has been recording deflation for the last two weeks.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, at the end of August since the beginning of the year strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Yakovenko stressed.
In addition, since April in the Russian Federation there is an increase in industrial production.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics is also demonstrated by the situation in the labor market, where the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the prosperous situation on the labor market, the issue of real disposable incomes of the population is left to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8%.
This factor can hamper economic recovery, as household spending contributes significantly to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, as risk factors for economic growth can also be called rigid policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which is not the best effect on the real sector.
A negative factor is the insufficiently high level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015", - says analyst of GC Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well established in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, has not yet been so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and perform former foreigners, in most cases we are talking about natives of the countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a fairly large number of Russians act under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents took to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone did not stand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone thought that better conditions for development in sport would be created abroad.
AIF.ru has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of the 27-year-old girl says that her name is Lisa Red.
But before that, of course, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with a pole.
If she had stayed in Russia, she would hardly have been able to "move from the throne" Elena Isinbaeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be our only compatriot, albeit former, in the sector for jumping with a pole.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championships and the silver of the 2016 Continental Championship, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelical direction.
Mostly because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started to struggle in school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where she continued her classes at the US Wrestling Training Center under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup in the same year - a victory.
Before that, she, by the way, managed to win silver at the 2010 world championship.
After that were the bronze of 2013 and silver of 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first got acquainted with synchronized swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
There, Mary continued her studies.
She soon joined the U.S. national team and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that at a serious international level, it cannot compete with Russian synchronists, but for America, its indicators are the ceiling.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Kristina Shaldybina received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Until that moment, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States, she organized a real breakthrough - brought the star-striped team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our former “artist” is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
She was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more chances to get to the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
There, however, Yana was able to take only the 17th place, not enough to get into the final competition in the personal championship.
But two years earlier, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the aforementioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
However, Ira still trains in Russia - she specially comes to her homeland in order not to lose skill.
She did not perform as well in Rio as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal all-rounder.
There is very little information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a record of the country at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to perform under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the 4<0xC3><0x97>100 relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, the champion of Russia, the master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped being in our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from the sports platforms.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket for the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, in his homeland is known even less than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to practice gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio his best result was 40th place in qualifying on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming classes, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took the 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In the duet with Eugenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
In the solo program, she was fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kreuter plays for Israel.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry has already become the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croyder also won gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry is engaged in long jumps and triple jumps.
31-year-old Albert - another native of Hasavurt, who after long performances for Russia decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of High Sports Excellence of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the player of the USSR national volleyball team Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained there for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became a bronze medalist of the European Championship, held on the territory of his new homeland.
Hadzhiyev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was trapped with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - we had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to learn free wrestling.
Soon he won the junior world championship, and later qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again a free fight, and again a former Russian.
This time we will talk about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - Taimuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and currently plays for the Spanish national team.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to score high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the national championships in 2007 and 2008.
Tired of not being in the national team, Taymuraz decided to change sports citizenship.
The last on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala - Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion of youth.
In 2015, Bijarslanov won the gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children have Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, "Cossacks should be educated not with actions and parades, but systematically."
They should grow up and at least 7 years old understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But so far this work seems to be being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positives that have been accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If everything is in a hurry and we do not know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and communal services continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
There is an intruder on the funds allocated for the needs of the communal sphere from the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, high tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing sector.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid energy workers more than 170 million rubles.
Recently, the prosecutor’s office of the Krasnodar Territory also revealed the facts of the inclusion of unreasonable costs in the tariffs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (according to the cold water supply) were invested 4 million rubles. for the rental of cars at a price above the market.
There are many examples of this in the country.
The people give the "communal" the last money, and pay properly, - according to the Ministry of construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually performed, but paid.
Businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay service providers and spent it on his needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
Makarov’s scheme of machinations, alas, is typical of Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of leaders of the Criminal Code, who appropriated the money of citizens, took place throughout the country.
In Kamchatka continues the trial of A. Kochan, by the way, also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of fraud for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, in Elizovo Kamchatka Territory, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the Criminal Code, the other two played the role of settlement and cash centers, that is, they took money from the population.
However, A. Kochan did not transfer funds to energy workers, but spent on himself, his beloved.
It is quite difficult to judge in the housing sector.
Cases are not aroused, they are delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvorotneva, Executive Director of NP "HKH Control".
We do not have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one that should make the previous one work.
Specialists, including among judges, on housing issues are also few.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in universities.
Refusals to initiate criminal cases, loopholes in the course of investigations are also reported in the Prosecutor General’s Office.
Less than half of the 3,5 thousand crimes in the proceedings in 2015 were sent to the courts.
For the rest, the investigation was protracted and one in five were suspended due to the failure to identify the accused.
Often, deficiencies in the activities of law enforcement agencies are blamed on gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the investigating authorities are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeits - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the last five months of the year, the number has increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the protocol of the meeting of tenants?
This means: a change in the management of the house, financial and other issues go bypassing the opinions of the owners.
And it also means that normal companies that want to work honestly, and not “milk” the population, cannot enter the housing and utilities market.
It turns out that the tenants are at a disadvantage, small and medium-sized businesses too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such throughout the state, - Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Issues, is sure.
This work is now being actively carried out.
This is not just a single action - it is a targeted course in the fight against corruption.
Of course, not in all regions such a sad situation.
In particular, scandals in the capital and does not smell.
Why are there no such scandals in the housing sector in Moscow, as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital's government has shown an iron will and brought order," Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Countering Corruption, told AIF.
I am referring to the personnel issue, and legislative amendments, and legal education.
The management companies are closely supervised, and all of them have gone through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (and the appeals of tenants, and response measures are posted on the portal of the Moscow government).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but carefully monitor what is written there, how the house is kept.
Awareness among the population of the rights of owners and obligations of resource supplying and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the validity of tariffs for housing and utilities - after all, a considerable part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Perhaps all this together and explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Is it all based on the will of the regional authorities?
Is it possible to change the place of work?
The Turkish Gambit.
Can Erdogan give up his friendship with the European Union and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has put forward an ultimatum to the United States, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of orchestrating a coup.
He said this in a speech to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan urged Americans to abandon support for the “terrorist organization of fethullahists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey's relations with the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the FET<0xC3><0x96> (Fethullah Terrorist Organization).
Either organizing the coups of the FETO, or democratic Turkey.
She must make that choice," Erdogan's address in Ankara on Wednesday evening was quoted by the Anatolian Agency as saying.
The Turkish president once again, but more firmly demanded from the United States to comply with his demand, voiced by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdogan addressed the population, the rebellion was crushed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people were under suspicion, in the ranks of which, in addition to the military, there were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that the Americans could be directly involved in the coup.
The United States denied all claims against it, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The last statement of the representatives of the State Department in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan’s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the Turkish president - he persistently insists on his own and also makes demands to other Western partners.
“Ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not give a date for lifting visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,” Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Celik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara’s amendments to the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe’s own security.
On August 1, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders to migrants in order to achieve visa facilitation with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu.
<0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu made another provocative statement on Wednesday, admitting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish Foreign Minister did not rule out that the country will consider leaving the alliance if it does not meet the expected support from him.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defense sphere - they import missiles," Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its own technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
“So far, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results did not satisfy us, and we began to look for others,” the minister said.
Experts believe that all this indicates a serious disagreement between Turkey and the West and the reorientation of the country to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go for a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot tied to the West both in terms of business and in terms of military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance, maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for the Americans to see a completely obedient person in this position," the expert explained to AIF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (on non-payment of compensations from the EU, on the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States) will be pressured on him.
"Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country and so on," Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information Alexei Mukhin admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view in relations with Russia, as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance on Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after a while the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Being between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself, "- said Mukhin.
In his opinion, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States ceases to support Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert believes.
The head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazova, holds a different point of view.
Currently, Turkey’s relations with both the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policy that Erdogan personally conducts.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the backdrop of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to restart politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, there is active political cooperation with Iran," Glazova explained, admitting that Erdogan's next step will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is currently pursuing is a return to the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions began.
It was at that time that Turkey began to actively develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in the “zero problems” position.
We have had very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's positions both on the regional and international arena," the expert said.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relationship with the EU, but the question now is whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open its borders to migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Junior Doctors Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of junior doctors appealed to the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of Junior Physicians (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students in July voted to cancel the employment deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members participating in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government continued to “persistently remain silent” about issues she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “Given the current situation, the head of JDC voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous program to expand collective protests starting in early September.
The controversy has led young doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strike in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA’s junior physician leader, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after a vote to cancel the agreed terms of the employment contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good deal to accept during meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the persistent impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked strained, and he hardly radiated heat even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, has repeatedly spoken about his “dear friend” Mr. Putin – five times, according to one report.
I lost my count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested otherwise.
But the protracted coolness emanating from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Mr. Putin burst into an angry tirade, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, coming from an alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media carried out a stunning, total offensive on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations were made by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan’s own family profited from the illegal trade of oil from the areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied it.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, the meeting only happened because Mr. Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can make after he was almost ousted from his post last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has dropped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly feel relieved when flights finally resume.
They are at the peak of the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," according to a report in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to that her prolonged dissatisfaction with the turtle-like pace of EU accession talks and Mr. Putin’s move to take advantage of the coolness and gradually break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support for elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West, joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the possibility of a total catastrophe when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it’s certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank’s executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was tied to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has backed away from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer lending brands.
It has been supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that will gain more influence – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview during a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one that our staff will be employed in because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their populations, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building the profile of various brands in sponsorship of the sport.
“This is a good time for us to move the bank brands as the core (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focusing on customer needs rather than our own, I think you’ve seen a lot of change.
We can get these brands back again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Passion
Dettori splashes champagne after a take at Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori achieved his 3,000th British victory at the Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track – on Passion, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iddery, and Willie Carson.
Three-time jockey champion Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: “It’s something special.”
I am very excited because my family is here too.
I am very glad that it happened in Newmarket, because this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big secular event, it’s not Royal Ascot — it’s a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am business-free and very unpretentious.
Dettori accepts applause when he leads Predisposition after victory
Two jockeys reached this mark in the obstacle course: jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical wit that distinguishes him from the others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he hadn't been just a jockey for weekends and big races!
Frankie has been leading winners in the UK for most of the past 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but more than that, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a branded swift jump off the horse
From swift finishes to swift jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth racing for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
A number of big race winners, including his famous Ascot Magnificent Seven in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was suspended for doping.
Three years ago, he first encountered difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while — Dettori had previously said he would like to continue competing until at least the age of 50.
Putin dismisses the head of the administration of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of the administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative for the environment and transport.
A Kremlin statement said Putin had “decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,” but did not give the reason.
Mr. Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Wino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Embassy of Tokyo.
He later served as head of the presidential protocol and government apparatus, according to the Kremlin’s website (in Russian).
During the appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Does a smile convince you?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As the head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration resigned on his own.
But despite the smiles on camera, it has convinced few here – especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that a man once campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia’s environmental policy — was met with enormous skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, you might say, a troubled position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, just like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term for Putin would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after just three and a half years.
'Think Like a Criminal' star Thomas Gibson fired after fight with producer
Gibson was involved in a brawl on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday, before his suspension was announced.
There were creative disagreements on the set and differences of opinion.
I regret that this happened," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character will be removed from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to come later, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
“I love Think Like a Criminal and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I hoped to be in it until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best fans the show could only dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: the fish landed in the garden of Banff
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish may have been sandstones left behind by a waterstorm.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a picture of this spectacle in the Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern span and the Queensferry Crossing Viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four “canvas sweeps” that are now coming to completion near all three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vants of the bridge.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in Queensferry Crossing’s construction.
We are all witnessing the engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel were used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79% of the entire bridge is now in place, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete coating is cast in Rosate today, which means that the entire canvas is ready for lifting to the place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure of each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this close-up represents the most modern construction art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it to the expanding roadway of the North Pylon, we had to close the remaining gap on the north - or facing the shore - side.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern approach 700 millimeters south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very elegant operation.
Scale because the 222-meter-long viaduct weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised to an angle of about 3%.
Elegant because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, all of this went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men 'lucky to stay alive'
Three men were "lucky to be alive" after being thrown off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety, while their boat continued its course.
“We saw their ship circling beside them and assumed the worst,” said Moelfre’s lifeboat commander Vince Jones.
“Fortunately, by the time we went down to the water, a strong wind had carried him away from them,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third 60-year-old man was found exhausted and caught in a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were lifted aboard a coastal lifeboat and brought to a rescue station.
Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water were fortunate to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat’s engine had an emergency breaker, but it somehow disconnected from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It is exciting to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go pulls people away from the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Screen time was initially limited to television, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It’s so great to see that technology and outdoor activity aren’t mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the all-encompassing enthusiasm that is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which later spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other offshoots).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, this all lost its former relevance a little before this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, once detected, can be 'photographed' (through a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
The generation that played the game when they were younger joined the craze by breaking away from the search sofas.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by an “ordinary” person daily.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people it tracked who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on passing levels.
Many health campaigns urging people to “find 30 minutes,” “get off the couch” and “be active every day” have not found a response, because most health messages are boring and voiced by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes and an even longer list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it drags people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boreholes who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might bump into a door.
What's the matter?
The breakthrough happened.
Despite the fact that smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our physical activity before, they did not give us a reason to learn, as this game gives.
The novelty will come, and the use will weaken with time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, more games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Biles is invulnerable to all of this.
dynamics of the jump.
Unforced on a log.
Stunning on the floor.
Amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of absolute champion on Thursday, placing a chasm between herself and the rest of the world in a compelling demonstration under close Olympic scrutiny.
Her total score of 62.198 was at a sufficient distance from silver medalist and teammate "Final Five" Eli Reisman and Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Biles from the United States performs on a gymnastics log during the final of the women’s individual absolute rhythmic gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row to win the title of absolute champion and the fifth overall, solidifying her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She cried when she was shown her final overall score and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the past three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Cup medals – including 10 gold – with such stunning programs in their blend of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the greatest gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
One last test awaited in Brazil, a competition not so much between the Biles and the rest in this field, but between it and the load of overestimated expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family’s home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unfulfilled expectation.
Simona Biles of the United States, on the left, and Eli Riceman hug after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the Women's Individual Absolute Rhythmic Gymnastics Championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of resigning national coordinator Martha Caroli.
While Biles insisted that she never looked to the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not quite the case.
Part of her free exercise program—the one that includes her signature pass—is set on Latin American music that would fit right in the street just outside of the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a walking baby and discovered by coach’s mother Amy Boorman during a visit to the gym where Boorman was the coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single absolute championship competition since the summer of 2013 — a lane of luck that should last as long as Biles wants.
Despite the fact that Mustafina gained a small advantage with the help of two rotations, it was a mirage.
Gymnastics beam and free exercise – where Biles defends the title of world champion – lie ambush.
She went forward again with 15,433 on the log and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Risman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score — a mere formality — and tears appeared around the shiny red with the white and blue Biles eyeliner when the plan she once recorded on the clipping album came true.
Raisman's performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost bronze to Mustafa in a tie-break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "Grandma" was much ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered by a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old’s viral tweet from earlier this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the case of a serial killer shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who were killed in the deadliest attack on Phoenix's first serial killer in a decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot dead on June 12 when their car was parked on the roadway, authorities said.
The offender fired about eight shots from the pistol while standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he fled on another vehicle, according to the report.
Police say the triple homicide did not appear to be the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallets or $2,900 at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether it was linked to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over a four-month period.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the house,” said Howard KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
A witness told police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings and recovered the bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund's microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was I couldn’t do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for it.
Which, in fact, is not true – of course you sign up for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in a specialized medical institution.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people were still doing that,’” Pixivto said.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three, and he still does not speak.
But it is slowly going through some stages.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows a gesture that Edmund came up with for "please sing to me."
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Pixivto told CBS News.
But not just ordinary sign language – she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund's, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to say how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I always tell you what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn’t really ask for a lifetime prognosis because I don’t expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods cause rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rain expected to fall over the state by Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and south Mississippi have come off the shores and threaten large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and aid had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for high-water transportation, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the arrival of Tanjipahoa requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The risk of flooding remains in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could invade the area.
In southern Alabama, on-call waiting for the flooding continued until Friday, as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Komit River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to set a flood level record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alec Krautmann said both rivers could have flooded many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said flooding downstream in the Assenschen parish is a threat as these swollen rivers will slowly drain into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of flooding in Amit and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, quickly rose overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
“We woke up and the water kept coming,” Hansford said.
It has reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the largest influx she had seen in 48 years to live here.
Hansford said he and all his family members have a disability and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the three with the help of an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they took shelter on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is "spreading rapidly" as rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says an observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain falling from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated by rainfall from Wednesday.
Heavy rains and flooding of the streets led to work to rescue residents from homes in the parish of Tanjipahoa and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
WWL, an affiliate of CBS, reports that Tanjipahoa's advisor told of 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now flooding.
The parish chairman, Robbie Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who were trapped in the high water.
Shelters were opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to retreat," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tanjipahoa parish, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were made available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It is on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services, Rupert Lacey, reported that siege rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, the head of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before,” Towson said, “and it’s still pouring down.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, "smashed by bullets", remains alive after a shootout in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting in a six-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandparents say Brown received multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
“He was hit hard, his little body was ripped apart by bullets,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in hospital in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reportedly in critical condition; two other victims were reported in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
A child was found shot dead in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old man in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators are reporting to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
Sleeves from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons, sealed the place of action.
It seems like it was definitely a long battle.
There were shell casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, it seems that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shootout," Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many homes and cars in the area have also been hit.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly looking at surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was hit in the arm by a crazy bullet Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby, and Laurie
This is what I call this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team and for several reasons.
First, I’ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Coshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It has also strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America applauded.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected, but nonetheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women’s individual absolute championship.
And teammate Ali Reisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn’t look like that in gymnastics sections across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of coaching Martha Caroli.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs, supported by parents who pay for tuition, equipment, travel, uniform, fees for participation in competitions, payment for hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get the best out of their workouts, and it’s an expensive and long-term obligation for gymnast families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Honey, Laurie Hernandez's coach, both coached their athletes from the moment they started gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and affordable gymnastics training for the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young boys (mostly black and Hispanic) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, success at school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and this is great.
Playing sports is very important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
“Thank you, Simone, Ali, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of ‘Women’s Power’ in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The junior doctors took up the announcement of further strikes after the rejection of the proposal of Jeremy Hunt
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by negotiating an amended contract with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the treaty, saying the NHS was on "no man's land" and any subsequent delay would hurt staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in work activities at night and on weekends to improve service during extra-hours.
Dr. Ellen McCot, chairwoman of the BMA’s Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: “The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will feed the existing labor crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The WMA's attempt to settle the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence from the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door was always open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to act now to inspire the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are unequivocal in that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike at the end of April delayed some 13,000 scheduled surgeries and 100,000 nurses' appointments, while nurses and consultants were recruited to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by negotiating an amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants a better payday for the 54,000 junior doctors who will fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: "Strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on teams and services already at the limit, and cause anxiety, physical pain and distress to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Junior Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive support on other important topics — such as staff allocation, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, tuition costs, mutual recognition of curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gaps in medicine — were a sign of how seriously employers had met,and the Health Education England and Health Department had met.
Drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to take the drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day, after authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer time.
The anti-convulsant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The UK National Health Service’s NICE Supervision Service advised giving it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the UK National Health Service’s NICE oversight agency has now advised giving it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs in approximately 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque is torn in pieces, then it can cause a thrombus, blocking the access of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it will be able to move along the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making blood clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention techniques, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By pre-recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited beyond three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
The culture of PC ownership allows the falsification of vote counts to flourish in Muslim areas
Tower-Hamlets ex-mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, prompting a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to blindness, which has resulted in widespread vote-counting fraud in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles has criticized police, election monitors and city administrations for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities over “excessive sensitivity about race and religion.”
The former community secretary, now an anti-corruption tsar, reported that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that police needed to be allowed to place cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take ID cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters only need to indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting ink on people’s fingers when they pass their ballots, in order to exclude anyone from voting twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to whistleblowers, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access for the press to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a vote scandal at Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Luftur Rahman, was to be removed from office because of a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman was said to have “led his campaign based on the fact that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were doubtful or were the result of personification, when a person votes by posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about the mail-voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
His report said: “Evidence has been provided of the pressure exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were concerns that ... government agencies had turned a blind eye to such behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of 'political correctness' about ethnicity and religion."
Cheese Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including suspending political activists from working with postal ballots to stop the “harvest of votes.”
The report, under consideration by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the use of voter lists for immigration and privilege fraud.
The option of requiring voters to present an identity card before voting is considered.
Use indelible ink on people’s fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Perform systematic checks on the nationality of people to make sure they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Suspend political campaigners and activists from working with filled absentee ballots and envelopes with postal voting.
Authorize the police to establish borders around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the 1983 People's Act Submission.
It is illegal to take photographs at polling stations.
Require only English to be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Enhance training to ensure that staff forces voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric has fiercely attacked the city's police, saying it is "striking" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The court hearing the election disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal activities,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful “checks for the sake of ticks” of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court order in the Tower of Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about the cycling analog of Kate and other doubles of celebrities of the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevo, who turned out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is far from the only athlete competing for gold this summer who boasts her own famous double — at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Allison, a member of the U.S. men's archer team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate’s doppelganger on the bike lane, many people have rushed online to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archer Brady Allison was the cause of the hurricane on Twitter after images appeared of him looking frighteningly similar to the star Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, the archer learned about the insanity of social media and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a huge resemblance, except maybe the vegetation on the face,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly point to even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her big expressive eyes, is said to be an exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg was compared to the star of the Chorus Matthew Morrison for many years.
Going to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is the "sports version" of the actor "Beginnings"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer from Russia Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same tanned skin and blond hair as actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, is similar to the "sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Rough Women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, on the right, have the same shapes of face and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to publicize his enthusiasm that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, the U.S. football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Lynnie, as well as the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful wide smile, which is similar to the smile of the star "Gabby Gavin" Succeed
Olympic commentator on CBC apologises for saying Chinese swimmer “died like a pig”
Byron McDonald's analysis of fourth place at the finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the women's freestyle relay 4x200 m outraged CBC viewers on Wednesday live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started like a stink” and “died like a pig” while swimming.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the women's 4<0xC3><0x97>200 m freestyle final.
You could hear McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC team of commentators to “dilute it with color,” say: “This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby.”
Too excited, started as a stinker, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, who is 14 years old, swam the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing the Canadians to eliminate the lag from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used
Emmett MacFarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC speaker just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'????"
The idiot didn’t realize they were still on the air.”
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's 4x200 m freestyle relay said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately fell on Byron McDonald, and many called for his dismissal
Twitter users couldn’t help but hear how insensitive Byron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, tweeted: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, "We apologise for making a comment about the swimming performance on the air."
It was a bad choice of words, we are sorry that it happened.
The IDF ended by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
The friend of the commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comments.
The TV network also hurried to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to go on the air.
Last night, we acted promptly to apologize to our live viewers and our social media subscribers.
Let’s be clear, Byron’s comments were about the swimmer’s performance, not her personality.
Still, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on a person.
“I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s relay,” he said on CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
“I was talking about the swimmer’s performance, not her in person.”
“It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I’m very sorry.”
Buyer of Primark insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman bared herself to try on her panties on the store floor in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she tried how she looked in them, pulled them down and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and ended up measuring four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall store in Folkestone.
The Primark store of the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where a woman tried on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
Two-child mother Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after fitting her underwear, the mysterious woman again "clothed herself and walked out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shopping hall, she took a pair of panties from the showcase, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
“She didn’t try to find a secluded place to do it – she just stood there, shameless.”
“Everyone stared when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same with three other couples before finally deciding that there was nothing here she liked, dressed up again and went out.
“It doesn’t seem like she cared who was watching her or what she thought about the person who would eventually buy those underpants that she was trying on.”
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said: "It's disgusting to think that someone is going to take home the panties that someone else has already worn and they have not been washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale after she left - well, all the better."
“I don’t want to come home with a new pair of women’s panties and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off, and they weren’t washed.”
A Primark spokesperson said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks Using a Krav Maga
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Ron Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If you come from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and “release the line of fire.”
Then you squeeze the gun firmly between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with a loose elbow.
Then follow the knee into the groin, and while the attacker bends with pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, punch him in the face with the barrel and step back, holding the gun pointed at him.
For an armed, fit front, the method of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab a gun and unscrew it so that the villain could not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before stepping back and aiming at him.

For a travel guide, traveler Ian Wright walks his tongue through the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler put his immune system and vomiting reflex to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Leading travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent his tongue on a euro banknote, the Piccadilly Circus railing, a toilet flush button on a train, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a film called “The Traveler-Lizun Guide to the Inner Force,” has yielded some surprising results.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing from the lick brought him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing his intestines, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public railings at train stations to toilet flush buttons, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, "Since I was a child, I was completely carefree about my health and I pulled a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test smear showed a luminometer value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer value was more than 4,000 units, while the just washed hands show less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy maker Valio have made a traveler film called The Lizun Traveler's Guide to Inner Power, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet.
In the film, he said, “It’s close to one of the worst things I’ve sniffed in the toilet.”
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
“The Traveler-Lizun Guide to Inner Power” was filmed together with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains sour-milk bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio Senior Vice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Nico Vuorenmaa said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: "Let's say this: I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Naturally, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were quite tough.
I’m glad that some of these licks have been filmed.”
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents attributed sour-milk bacteria exclusively to good stomach and gut health, and 58 percent said they consumed at least occasionally foods containing sour-milk bacteria added.
Hooligan Family Destroyed Saltash, Cornwall Municipal House, on the eve of eviction
The hooligan family left their municipal home with losses of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found the property in a condition requiring repairs.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the shelves were opened, the rubbish was scattered on the floor and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is believed to be living in a private apartment
Donna McAvoy, a resettlement worker at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he could not be saved.
She said, “It’s been an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I don’t think people should live like that.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed because this property will probably be known as a not very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys bad reputation, and their name enjoys bad reputation.
The couple have three sons who lived in the property from time to time, and police report that the realm of horror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be demolished, found old rubbish
The floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from their home this week after they were granted an extended 11-week period for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said, “They didn’t care about anyone.”
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is unbelievable.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and then regularly called the police
Garbage and old toys were scattered below the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant could not accept any responsibility for the behavior of her and her family, as eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, as the behavior was marginal, and their actions must have been terrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police, and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done bravely to provide us with the information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove piles of garbage that surrounds the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales, matching supplies and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for supply.
She said the money went to pay for a tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is reported that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were stained with graffiti all over the surface.
The police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the rules of renting the premises.
Angela Crowe, of the Devon and Cornwall Police Department, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the accuser’s accusations, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Criminal and antisocial behavior will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to relax in the sun were terribly afraid for their lives
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force said he was conducting a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when the low-flying plane hovered over the crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a touch distance from the hunters on a sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped on their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned with the noise of the aircraft’s engines, but unable to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the city of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted a video of the shocking flyby on social media, said: "It flew very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I swear there was a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were terribly frightened when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was conducting a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the shore, and was forced to sink so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the Air Force insisted no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged Portugal's mainland and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances - thick fog and smog from forest fires that worsened visibility.
The aircraft was performing a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HACCP system has been mandatory for catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are becoming more active, and businesses face fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - has been mandatory for food manufacturers and carriers, as well as companies in the catering industry in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CC).
Business checks by Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials issue fines only for individual violations of the regulations (see "List of documents" ...).
Failure to comply with the regulations in general will cost the company 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HACCP as a system that takes into account the risks when working with food and prevents them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about food safety for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACCP has been operating on the territory of the TC.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HACCP requirement appeared in the technical regulations of the TC in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production, and not to restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is late August - early September.
But they will not cause high demand, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts note.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government with a request to allow charters now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of choosing a quality and affordable sea holiday is insoluble, since most of the accommodation facilities in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea have already been booked by the end of September," the authors of the letter note, stressing that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian sea travel products.
As reported in the North-West regional branch of the Russian Union of tourism industry (PCT), if the aviation agencies of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when the charters will be resumed, as yet, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, the planes can fly in September, even August, if the tour operators quickly build programs and agree with the airlines on the necessary boards in the direction," says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Branch of the PCT.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but it will not affect too much the balance of forces in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spending holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now makes very budgetary proposals - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are purposefully waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is definitely not worth counting on excitement - the bulk of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but the hype is not worth waiting.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for next season," Rumyantsev said.
“The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season,” agrees Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for exemption from compensation payments established by law within the approved norms related to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
The issue of milk to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions according to established standards is provided for in Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the norms and conditions of issuance are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, the free delivery of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to employees on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors at the workplace.
On the basis of these norms, the Federal Tax Service of Russia in the letter in question came to the conclusion that, on the basis of paragraph 2, paragraph 3 of Article 217 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, income in the form of the value of milk issued to employees on days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the norms and conditions approved by the order of the Ministry of Health of Russia No.
Moscow "Gazstroybank" was left without a license of the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to conduct banking operations from the credit institution Joint Stock Commercial Bank "GAZSTROYBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC JSC "GASTROYBANK" carried out a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets have led to the emergence of grounds for the credit institution to implement measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in questionable transit operations.
The bank has appointed a temporary administration for the period of validity until the appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
JSC "GAZSTROYBANK" is a participant of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with the Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On Insurance of Deposits of Individuals in Banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles in total per depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the report, the amount of assets of JSC JSC JSC "GASTROYBANK" on August 1, 2016 took 335 place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Qadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, was reportedly killed in Syria.
Tasnim Akunji’s lawyer said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a stronghold of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only advantage of all this - as a tombstone and a will to others, that these are precisely the risks that we are talking about when traveling to a war zone - is to discourage people from ever making the same choice," Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan’s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland’s approval, but how President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the man who can replace the last Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a conference call on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland “with some degree of certainty.”
Representative Reid later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn’t want to “swing the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were "snitches" and "accomplices" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for the job.
Treats claims erotic calendars for 'women as well as men'
Treats has partnered with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they set out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude muses.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to go back to the demonstration of the eternal and classic nude figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Muscovites will be handed out memos about unscrupulous online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to issue a memo that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the specialists of the department are preparing a memo that will help citizens to choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this booklet includes several sections.
These will be general information and legislative framework, rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to properly draw up a claim and so on,” Rospotrebnadzor said.
The memo is currently being finalized.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute to Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in the Crimea.
Persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them - Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zakhtey Andrey Romanovich.
"They all give confessions," the statement said.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporizhzhya region, Yevgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in the Crimea, admitted his guilt at interrogation.
FAS fined Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles.
"The fine for Google for violation of antitrust legislation amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay the fine in the near future,” said the deputy head of the FAS Alexey Dotsenko.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia, Google Play store applications only on condition that the device will be installed and other applications of the corporation.
Among these applications is a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates part 1 of Article 10 of the Federal Law "On Protection of Competition" (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a favorable effect on our consumers.
The Law "On Protection of Competition" must be observed by all companies, whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations, including," said Elena Zaeva, head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Office of the FAS of Russia.
The agency suspects 16 Russian shops of collusion.
The New Bookstore was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide".
New Bookstore has been fined for selling Stace Kramer’s 50 Days Before My Suicide, according to the Moscow City News Agency.
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as “provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents.”
The Ostankino District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products to children and decided to impose a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products seized by the Rospotrebnadzor.
A source in the New Bookstore confirmed that it is a work of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookshops in Moscow are undergoing checks for the availability of the book "50 days before my suicide".
In Moscow, there will be an evening of commemoration of Ernst the Unknown.
An evening of memory of the sculptor Ernst Unknown will be held in Moscow, TASS reports.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Literaries.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States in person.
Therefore, it was decided to organize this evening for those who want to remember him in their native land," the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
It was noted that this is important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown were invited to the evening, including the poet Evgeny Evtushenko, the artist Boris Messerer, the president of the Pushkin Institute Irina Antonova, the director Mark Rozovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Department of Culture of Moscow Alexander Kibovsky, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier it was reported that the relatives of Ernst Unknown plan to hold a funeral for the sculptor in New York, presumably, until August 14.
Vinyl End User: Who Really Buys Vinyl?
Lonely middle-aged men love vinyl.
And as long as you do not rush to clutter the comment section with gross insults under the pseudonym Non-Single Men of the Middle Years, this statement follows from the factual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of records is due not to the boom among the generation of 2,000, who want to imbue themselves with the novelty of a material object, but to the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are more likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group of 18-24 years are the least likely.
It’s also not just the act of collecting amateurs – it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the center of the bustling Soho street, in a modest gray suit and violently gestured before a stop, folding my arms and saying something impressive like, "Well, let's see."
All right, let's see.
While the heart of the Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt — hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores are now flooding buildings once occupied by independent sellers — a few music stores with fantastic specialists are still left.
I’d probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I’m close to different people in some of these stores and trying to gauge their age and emotional state of mind through observation.
Glasgow native Stewart, 55 years old, whom I followed from Sister Ray (counting data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting data: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20), in London for a half-day to hold a meeting, and strolling around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
“I guess so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me a picture, I didn’t follow him home), run in lines along the walls of his living room.
His reason for buying so many albums and singles comes in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn’t afford when they first came out and buy back items he sold when he was young and broke.
“A lot of what I buy is the late '60s, the early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy the records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding: “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink too much.
That's my flaw.
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the hype in the media, people who heard about the return and felt the obligation to buy back their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revival figures of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the records?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Ouez, some older customers, in particular, are insulted by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel shaken by the digital world and prefer to retreat to the permanence of familiar record envelopes, items that evoke memories of serene youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling in a void or possessing material things as a kind of soothing,” says Wes.
Since I’m a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it too.
It’s an easy way to keep your head occupied.
"We are like their social workers!" - said a colleague from the shelf of records.
An ICM survey in April found that nearly 50 percent of people who bought a vinyl album last month hadn’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% had a record player that they never used, while 7% of those who bought vinyl had no record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled, sliding through the rack with the collections of Bosanów.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe noticed.
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on my shelf,’” he says.
It’s not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More music, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, they are a little under twenty, who are just getting acquainted with this.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire vinyl floor, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples over 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less laid-back than in the aforementioned stores – the latest synth and sexy Wild Beast pop, rather than jazz improvisation, breaks through the speakers – it’s nice to see the diversity in your customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the excruciating psychological trauma is hard to establish by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27, walked Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records on sale.
She looks at the goods, not spends the money.
She doesn’t earn much, she says, so collecting records isn’t a very good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." - she immerses herself in dreams with a sigh of love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Fashionistas.
While I create the illusion that I’m looking at denim-framed shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before a father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of a Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac plates: a mix of modern style and classics, a must-have for any medium-sized collection.
No one is looking—perhaps because they are just decorations, some so high up on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "artistic vinyl."
But, given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho backlands for a while longer, there’s almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the stratum of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the stratum that spends most of the money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they don’t rule out the existence of a huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record stores and on online forums.
These people probably work all the time in school or offices.
But they clearly don’t spend the morning of Thursday strolling around Berwick Street’s record shops, scrolling through records and avoiding the gaze of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake presenter who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark — the longest-lived vertebrate animal — video report
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the record was set by a female aged from 272 to 512 years and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut their hair or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or the simplest dishes for a few euros in homemade restaurants.
Calais Prefecture has argued that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, claiming that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the people who run the 72 home-made stores, but said Calais Prefecture's problems were "completely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people who “live in extremely shaky conditions.”
He said the spaces provided quiet meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One place that was in danger of being demolished was the children’s cafe Jungle Book at the camp, which works not for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and asylum counselling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children’s cafe.
The letter, sent to the Guardian, said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are no more than eight years old."
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number at Camp Jungle had risen to more than 9,000 people — the highest ever — after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Microdistrict libraries invite young freelancers to educational programs.

The programs are aimed at a children's audience, so most of them will be in a playful form.
Today, August 10, the branch library No. 2, in the linear microdistrict, invites you to the cruise presentation "My Town is Small".
On August 11, in the branch library No. 1 there will be a local history class "I live in this city, I know this city".
In the branch library No. 2 on the same day will be held a multimedia lesson "Land of native past fate".
And in the branch library No. 4 in Surazhevka there is a game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, for the children from the northern district, the library-branch No. 3 will hold a game program "Physics-Hello!".
Britain stops on silver in Rugby 7 after Fiji’s master class allows them to take gold
The UK’s impressive Rugby 7 series was crushingly stopped at the final obstacle by Fiji’s team in the final Thursday night when they were completely defeated by 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class on possession of the ball, passing, evasion, support of the game, running lines and brute force to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of silver – Britain’s third in a day – and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic Rugby-7 tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The painful beating of Box, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, could come back to negatively affect them in the final.
But, no matter what, Fiji in this form defeated the best team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for the UK – but probably not – that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach is Ben Ryan, a former Wimbledon England boss.
It was a journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one here.
These blows will cause pain, but the progress is striking.
Fiji started great, for the sake of fun repulsing the attempts of the UK to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau dived into the corner.
Having four minutes on the clock, Jerryr Tuvay added another right-sided touchdown, which was realized.
12-0 and the UK barely touched the ball.
A splendid attempt to intercept Mitchell prevented mountain man Leon Nakarava from scoring a third, but this only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jas Veremaloua made a touchdown in the right corner, and the UK lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after the resumption and there was still more than a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through several more idle attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The realization resulted in 29-0 in the break.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play rugby-7, while the UK is still mastering the craft.
Which is pretty much the case.
The UK made massive replacements at halfway through the game, and they blocked the Fiji dam... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton made an attempt for the UK by making a touchdown in the left corner to score 36-7, but the game has long been on the path of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of Fiji's approach.
Mata William embellished the Fijian cake, which did not need embellishment, another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, and the UK slightly beat South Africa in the tense semi-finals of one attempt for each — the difference British realization.
Kyle Brown leads Box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton with the help of some magnificent footwork broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant final intercept attempt from Markus Watson, England's 15-way brother, Anthony, secured the victory - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning Inspired to Win Rowing by Coach’s Fight Against Cancer
There will be no more exciting gold at these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy lifts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have found the added value of their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two that pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always there as they sought the second consecutive Olympic gold in female pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, after all it was their 39th unbeaten performance, once again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant female athletes, sliding on the surface with the elegance of swans, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold rowed a battalion of ready-made hands contributing to the gradually increasing victories that matter, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of the coach, who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous business.
I had bladder cancer, which is one that they can operate on, and they did.
If they don’t, they go everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your vision for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio are fortunate to have been able to start treatment in early 2014 off-season, keeping the schedule gap minimal if that may be the correct expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to pay, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking through the ward — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said there were enough few steps.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit bigger.
The moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of an artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said: “I’ve been an emotional wreck this week, maybe it’s a bit over the top, but it means so much.”
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin too.
It’s been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in phase.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren’t trying to do anything amazing.
We weren’t expecting fireworks today, we were just expecting to be able to row well and go out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a year for the couple to decide their future.
Glover is due to be at a wedding next month, on her own, with television adventurer Steve Backshall.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The government has extended the period of destruction of sanctions products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the period of destruction of foodstuffs prohibited for import into Russia.
The relevant decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The disposal of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were seized from sales.
The Hunt for "Forbidden"
Rains and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
Through the metropolitan region will pass atmospheric front, which will bring rainfall and lower the temperature of the air.
During the day, the air will warm up to 25 degrees of heat.
So, on the night of Saturday in Moscow places will be short-term rain, thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 15 m / s.
Rain is expected in the afternoon with thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also predicted in the Orel, Kursk and Voronezh regions, according to "Dni.ru".
Rainfall is unlikely next week.
The WTO Panel of Arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the organization’s rules.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia when it joined the WTO.
"This is the first time the WTO has taken a decision against Russia," the WTO said in a statement on its official website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia’s measures were “systematic” or “comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, promised in the near future to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of economic development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that U.S. behavior in resolving controversial issues at the WTO undermines the organization’s principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members due to the refusal of the Americans to approve for a second term the South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It currently has 162 members.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's Administration Changed Leadership
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vaino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has made changes in the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino said during the meeting that he considers important the anti-corruption work that he began to carry out as head of the Presidential Administration Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the reshuffle will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who has been working in the presidential administration for quite a long time, has effectively built up the activities of the AP, has left.
Instead of him came Deputy head of administration Anton Vaino - a man who knows the specifics of this work.
In Poland, they admit that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years gas supplies from Russia may become unattractive for it due to the reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by the vice-president of the Polish finance company Bohuslav Ma<0xC5><0xBE>ec.
His words are from Tass.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas [from Gazprom] at all, we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main directions of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway," Mazec said.
Currently, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% higher than in 2015.
The Russian gas giant’s share of PGNIG’s purchases rose to 49.8% from 40% a year earlier.
On July 22, the Polish antimonopoly agency did not agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas through Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by the deputy chairman of the board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the Nord Stream 2 capacity will take place in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not yet plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for gas supplies from Russia after 2022, Deputy Chairman of the Board of the company Alexander Medvedev said.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased by 42% the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
The Deputy Chairman of Gazprom added that the mere fact of filing a Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price for Russian gas.
The commissioner of the Polish government on gas and energy infrastructure, Pyotr Naimsky, said that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland’s contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government’s commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, said that his country could abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 provides for the construction of two strands of a sea gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine’s border with Crimea.
This was announced by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, answering a question from journalists.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
Observers monitored the events at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
In the network appeared a video landed at the airport of Ufa passenger plane Yak-42, which rolled out of the runway by 400 m and crashed on the left wing.
The video was published by the TV channel “360”.
The emergency occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no injuries.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport operates as usual.
The Volga Investigative Department on the transport of the SCR was engaged in clarifying the reason for the hard landing of the aircraft of the liner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria Steffan de Mistura believes the fact of what happened is undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of intra-Syrian talks, which should begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of chemical weapons use in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the attack with the use of toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
Then the opposition said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow, these accusations were called a drop.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry accused the opposition group “Harakyat Nur al-Din al-Zinki” of the incident.
Soon it became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
“A few minutes later, I smelled gas, my eyes began to burn, it became difficult to breathe,” he said.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people died, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
UN special envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “There is a lot of evidence that this really happened.”
The prohibition of the use of chlorine for military purposes is stipulated in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its areas is carried out daily, and terrorists are preventing the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in military action.
The current regime of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered "insufficient to help the almost 2 million civilians trapped."
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be required every week to get help and evacuate sick and wounded from the city.
"We have to send bulk cargoes from a convoy of trucks in areas where the roads are practically destroyed, and those that remain are mined," Mr. Egeland said. - But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia opened “humanitarian windows” in Aleppo.
In the face of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city, Russia announced on August 11 a three-hour ceasefire that will be in effect daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to terminate the military operation and facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in the resorts of Thailand killed four people.
Several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed and 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions fell on the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, Russians are not among them.
No terrorist group has yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the country’s interior ministry hastened to say that Islamists are not involved.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
The attacks occurred at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuket area and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries to show development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the country is "confident that they are not associated with international extremist groups."
“It’s too early to draw conclusions,” Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, they are local sabotage, and we are trying to identify the identities of those behind them.
The blasts occurred on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is most likely directed against it.
According to Police General Sithichai Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a half-hour difference.
They were hidden inside trees in busy streets filled with dining tourists in restaurants.
One of the four dead was a Thai girl who sold street food.
The identity of the other victims is not yet known, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them are four German citizens, three Dutch citizens, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rosturizm reported.
Local experts also link the explosions to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country’s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission to draft a constitution appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and played a significant role in electing the country's prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that on May 22, 2014 in Thailand there was a military coup under the leadership of the commander of the army of the country Prayuth Chan-Ocha.
The move, he said, was prompted by an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed curfews and censorship, dispersed the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The government of Thailand, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Shinawatra, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred in central Bangkok near the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, injuring 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unknown people on motorcycles.
Authorities have stepped up security in the capital and mobilized military forces to protect the demonstrators.
In Sukhy Log, the development of conditions began.
As it became known to Kommersant, the government was invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Sukhoi Log gold field with the preservation of two key restrictions.
It is proposed not to allow the auction company, where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those applicants in the capital of which will not be at least 25% of the state.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players already do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources submitted to the government a draft order and conditions for the auction of the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources familiar with the situation told Kommersant.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed "Kommersant" that the project was submitted to the government.
A representative of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, who oversees subsoil use, told Kommersant that the project has not yet entered the office of the official.
"The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the government order is issued, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can be held in October," the Ministry of Natural Resources said.
According to Kommersant, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, prescribed in the version that was sent for approval to the ministries and the FOIV in July (Komersant has it).
The first is the presence in the capital of applicants of at least 25% state ownership.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 about foreign investments in strategic companies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law, as already written by Kommersant on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since the Sukhoi Log belongs to the subsoil of federal importance (stocks of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but declined to comment on the details before the order of the government.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015 "Kommersant" in the Ministry of Natural Resources and later confirmed by the Governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources his predecessor Sergey Eroshchenko, "had agreements on investment projects" Ro.
Who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors of "Kommersant" do not specify.
“But it’s in the spirit of the time: not to give up control of the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions,” says Kommersant, who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Sergey Donskoy, said that foreigners “can go to the consortium” if the applicants attract them “as a financial structure, technological partners”.
The interlocutors of "Kommersant" believe it is unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry is considered a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation, PJSC "Polyus", controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostec.
According to Kommersant, in July, the partners created the joint venture "SL Gold", where "Polyus" 51% shares, the structure of "Rostekh" RT-GR - 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, Poljus said Kommersant was "unquestionably interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," the Pole added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is for the government of the Russian Federation, Kommersant sources said.
The possibility of participation in the development of the Sukhoi Log was claimed by Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of gold producers of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated Kommersant's investments in Sukhoi Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are discouraged not only by the volume of investment, but also by the complexity of the project: serious exploration of reserves and technology for working with complex ores is needed, Kommersant’s interlocutors in the industry explain.
In the pension market launched the largest M&A transaction - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the "Gazfond Pension Savings" will be created NPF with a savings volume of about 373 billion rubles.
The launch of the procedure for merging four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofond", "Heritage" and "Gazfond Pension savings" - was announced yesterday by the owner of 100% of funds of LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
“The reorganization is carried out in coordination with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of the existing contracts,” the company said in a statement.
The merger is carried out on the basis of Gazfond Pension Savings.
As noted by the Director General of this NPF Oleg Bialoshitsky, the unification of funds allows solving several problems: expanding the geography of the presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the approximate deadline for the completion of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the volume of pension savings of the pooling funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reports on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the merger itself launched the group much later than competitors.
So, under the control of group O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard foundations.
“Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems,” said Nikolay Sidorov, general director of the NPF “Future”.
Active work on the consolidation of funds since April is underway in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regionfund" should merge into the NPF "Safmar" by the end of this year.
In 2017, the NPF “Trust” will join them.
"The merger of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operating processes and costs," Safmar's pension group said.
The pause in the merger of funds, which endured "KIT Finance Pension Administrator", can be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy back more than 40% of the volume of infrastructural bonds in which the group was actively located.
After the amendments to the resolution of the Central Bank in March this year on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, there are no more such restrictions.
If necessary, the entire issue can be redeemed by one major player," said Yuri Nogin, director of the ACRA ratings group of financial institutions.
Several leaders of the NPF from the top 15 on assets are another possible reason for the pause, calling the separation of spheres of influence and, as a result, personnel appointments in a single fund, which had to be agreed by the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
The request of "Kommersant" in the NPF "Gazfond" was also not answered.
Although the consolidation of funds is a labor-intensive and inexpensive event, at a long distance this decision will be justified.
As noted by the general director of the consulting company "Pension partner" Sergey Okolesnov, the "Pension savings" Gazfond has less outflows, the accession will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofond" in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software will be required.
The requirements of the Central Bank for the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is not advisable to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, said Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings of Expert RA.
"The effect of reducing duplicate functions will definitely cover the possible costs of the merger," Mitrofanov said.
The cost of merging four funds Sergei Okolesev estimates in 30-50 million rubles.
"The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles per year, while consolidating in the medium term, the budget is actually halved," he said.
The best Disney movie “Pete and His Dragon” was released in Russia.
Beautiful views of New Zealand, a graceful dragon, a heartwarming story and country songs are enough to once again believe in old-fashioned magic, believes Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human cub and a tender babysitter, and a devoted friend.
Pete names his friend Elliot, in honor of a puppy from a fairy tale book, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he is no longer distinguished from another clever woodsman, Mowgli, when he is covered and dressed in a thigh bandage.
In this form, Pete is discovered by the red-haired female hunter Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively deforests.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help to save it.
Pete takes an accelerated course of "being human" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowgirl shirts, a moral code in their hearts and smile more dazzlingly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too horrible for the viewer to truly hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge furry dragon also turned out not to be terrible at all, with a good bulldog muzzle, airliner wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon growls funny, growls, even growls and, fortunately, does not say, but he always wants to stroke, this is advantageously different from all known cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only small viewers, but also adults, begin to cry desperately in the three streams.
Surprisingly good and young Oaks Figley in the role of Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuously gives out a canonical grandfather that every child would be happy to have.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney movie “Dragon of Pete”, mediocre from the nose to the tip of the tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and feature films, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
No wonder the miracle helped.
In his painting Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
Overboard were the music numbers and most of the strange jokes.
This good fairy tale reads traits borrowed from "Bambi", "Alien" and many other sweet-hearted children's paintings.
Disney continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, "Pete and the Dragon" is not as stunningly beautiful as the same "The Jungle Book", and it does not have a skilled villain, which turned out to be Kate Blanchett as the stepmother in the new "Cinderella".
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the magical castle Disney director Lowry will receive once again - for the artistic adaptation of the story of "Peter Pan".
Worked in "Pete and His Dragon" tandem David Lowry and writer Toby Hallbrooks entered a new ambitious project about a boy not growing up on the eponymous fairy tale of James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov faces new charges
The lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor’s office found shortcomings in the case of their defendant.
The fact that the prosecutor’s office made such a statement, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We had planned to participate in the court session on the issue of limiting the acquaintance with the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting did not take place, and the investigators informed us about the presentation made by the prosecutor's office," Olga Dinze, a lawyer, told RBC.
She said that the prosecutor's office pointed out to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the collected materials were inconsistent.
Now the investigators will have to close the gaps in the evidence base and bring Alexander Sokolov a new charge.
Either another article of the Criminal Code will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with different arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
According to Kommersant, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation of the journalist of RBC the wording about “shaking the political situation in the direction of instability” and “the overthrow of power illegally”.
The correspondent of “Kommersantboscosport” ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, had lunch in the local canteen and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
I don't think life stops here for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end at midnight, after which athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, settlement and eviction from the village are carried out without stopping, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, at 7:30 in the morning in one of the temporary tents stretched heads of all the Olympic delegations.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which our, consider it exemplary - it was commissioned by one of the first and demonstrated to all the inspectors, even in it every now and then there are some flaws.
There's a problem with hot water, there's a problem with toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then began to come cleaners, but only slap some substance on the floor, and all.
The floors, you see, are innovative.
They can’t be washed humanly.
We know these floors - ordinary laminate!
In general, we have achieved a change of the cleaning company and now everything is OK with this.
The Olympic village is such a Yuzhno Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side by mountains, on the other by an impressive moat, in places flooded with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence around the entire perimeter, along which machine guns walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our team.
Looking at a small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems, apparently, are the most urgent for the domestic team.
There are two ads at the reception desk: printed "Please do not throw paper in the toilet!" and from the hand "I will accept a badge as a gift.
The stand itself drowns in pamphlets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "Memo on infectious diseases for those traveling to Rio de Janeiro", "First aid for drowning, foreign body in the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiopulmonary resuscitation", "First aid for burns, heat".
The text inside is very encouraging.
For example, such as: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, a favorable outcome does not await everyone.
Of course, there is a medical center in the location of the Russian national team, which is ready at any time to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the house, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster “No matter what, we will win!”.
And, of course, the poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who are afraid believe in them.
Let less of us, the sweeter the taste of victories, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for an even greater lifting of the spirit hangs the announcement: “Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team is carried out by Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order a prayer and other requests by phone ...
In general, on the territory of the village there is a Center of Meditation and Religious Rites for representatives of all religions.
But the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the loading of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to use during a fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled over the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I suppose, ready at any moment to rush to wash the innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold stairs.
On the fourth floor I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time acquaintance - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the trainer of our trampolines, who led them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, champion of Europe Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
There is nothing to complain about in large part, - shares the impressions of the honored coach of Russia. - We live for two, the beds, of course, are almost in-between, but this is uncritical.
The bathroom is one in four, but it's spacious.
The closet, of course, funny, made of fabric, does not inspire confidence, but things can be put.
"No, you're guessing, they're out of tea!" - shouts tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, met by me in the main dining room.
It is called the main one at least because it is a space of 2.7 thousand square meters and is ready to accommodate 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There are 60 thousand servings per day for free.
The menu options are: "The Best of Brazil", "Kitchens of the World", "Asian Dishes" and "Pizza, Pasta".
The last option, as I peeped, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let's say, I did not find soups in any of the divisions of the giant restaurant.
What kind of soups? - Kuznetsova wonders. - There is no tea!
I'm glad I brought the Chinese with me.
And a kettle.
But in general, just so you know, we have even worse food on the courts.
Here at least something can be chosen, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose cod for a couple and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a plaque with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
I must admit, it was edible.
I don’t even understand why such a queue is always at the local McDonald’s.
Our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), are waiting for the full, relaxed, “warm” athletes at the exit of the restaurant.
Deftly tricked - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provoking, you might say.
In order to receive a gift, you must answer at least eight out of ten questions correctly.
There are questions in Russian! - I was attacked by a girl from WADA.
But it wasn't the one I attacked.
I was in a patriotic mood, of course.
The second question was: “If I receive a notification of doping control, should I go to the doping control post immediately?”
I stopped at option B: "No, I have one hour."
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that you don’t have to wait for WADA to relax.
In any case, we need to show up immediately.
Well, in the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became quite critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I find it hard to follow a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and I find it hard, by the way!), then I can use supplements to get “additional nutrients to boost my performance.”
Ann, no, they don't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is categorically not prohibited, but strongly discouraged in several sentences.
WADA is not playing fair!
What's up, Russia? - the host of the quiz mockingly asks.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and all our bloodless team.
So I concentrated and with my last effort I won the unfortunate T-shirt.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a triumphant mood, I snuck into the gym next door.
I was interested in counting trainers.
Dropped 250.
He noted with surprise that not a single Russian athlete was found in this heap of treadmills.
But maybe it's the right thing to do?
Let the one who can’t play train!
But in a nearby polyclinic one of our guys was sitting.
In line for the ophthalmologist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the clinic, however, as in the whole village, wherever you spit, hangs a device for issuing condoms.
It has an inspiring call on it: "Celebrate with a condom!"
The only thing left to do is twist the iron, resembling a door lock handle, and a condom made of natural Amazonian latex will readily fall out of the machine.
I took one, as a reminder.
The athletes will not lose - they brought them 450,000.
Just for a festive and leisurely pastime in the Olympic Village there is a whole entertainment center.
Near it there is an educational plaque reminding that the International Olympic Committee in various ways spends on athletes $ 3.25 million per day.
The center is flooded with video games, billiard and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices similar to video simulators.
I am interested in a comrade in the form of the Ukrainian national team, who actively uses a strange toy.
He could, of course, just say that he does not want to talk to a man in the form of the Russian national team, and all.
Here, by the way, by some strange coincidence of circumstances in the eyes of the guys in yellow and blue.
The most playful team, it turns out.
To go around the whole village, looking in each of its corners, it takes at least three hours.
But, if it is to walk, and not to ride electric cars, you will open the house of the Canadian national team with an elk at the entrance and a tent with a refurbishing bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and dry cleaning, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods and a bureau, and a post office with unique stamps (only).
And late in the evening, you, exhausted, will sit next to an olive tree, hung with colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who left this world.
And you will be accompanied by a machine that randomly sprays insect-killing liquid, thinking about eternal.
About the Olympic Movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world withheld its breath watching how the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in the rapier at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first.
Maybe I’m even the only Muscovite who saw it happen – except, of course, those who watched the Carioca competition that night.
Only a real fan can understand that.
Imagine the deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors downstairs, as always at one o’clock in the morning, wake up and start yelling at each other in a gentle but very loud manner.
And threateningly moving furniture.
There is a tap in the kitchen - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
Nothing in the TV schedule is clear, so I just kept the channels “Match”, “First” and, just in case, “Russia” under control – although this is almost meaningless.
"Russia" - the homeland of repetitions, all the sport there for some reason in the record.
The series is broadcast live.
Hope, of course, for "Match" - the whole evening the young man shouted in the news first about the great semi-final Deriglazov-Shanaev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is U.S.-Australia.
I can’t say anything bad about this decision.
Australians were on par, the first half won.
Put in the place of the Americans who are sick of their own greatness.
As a result, we still lost, but, as now expressed, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but the fight with Di Francesca is coming, and on the screen without changes.
In a mild panic, I start to scroll through the channels.
It feels like it's the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep into the cable.
None of the thematic "Matches" fencing.
Oh, I feel like the fight's about to begin.
Text and twitter broadcasts of some sports sites do not suit me.
Convulsive surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the website of the "First", it turns out, there is a live technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this time.
I click on fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglazova perfectly counterattacks, goes forward on points - and quite obviously begins to drag the time.
The Italians play almost all the way back.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
Di Francesca rushes to Deriglazova, she retreats, time runs out, the Italian woman gives the injection.
Victory!
In a few seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports the fourth gold medal.
I guess I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
Foolish, faithful, and involved.
The Spiritual Directorate of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM Plenum obliged its imams to deliver Friday sermons only in Tatar, in order to force young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
The administration said that this "in no way infringes" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
Some mosques in Kazan complain that up to 60% of the parishioners do not understand the Tatar language, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar “will not reach the whole audience.”
Yesterday, the plenary of the DUM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
According to Mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigulin, this should become an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
“For those who say it is ‘difficult,’ in every large mosque we intend to organize lessons of the Tatar language absolutely free of charge,” Mr Samigulin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques preaching "should be already in the Tatar language".
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
The imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, “can thoroughly prepare for them.”
DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the Mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time in Kazan in a number of mosques previously used mainly Russian language.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnayev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, the leadership sets the task that all students should speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of any violation of non-Tatar Muslims," Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not obligatory, the main part of the prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian will remain in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was no serious threat of displacing the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC).
The head of the Executive Committee of the VKT Rinat Zakirov told Kommersant: "Mosques are an important part of our national life."
It would be unfortunate if the Tatar language was removed from this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language is "the desire of the imams themselves", but the Executive Committee of the VKT "considers it correct".
The imams interviewed by Kommersant, who gave sermons in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the DUM, but they believe that parishioners will have difficulties with understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
They will, of course, be grief-stricken.
“We will have to rebuild,” says the imam of the Burnayev mosque, Farkhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, sermons in Russian are even closer to many Tatars, since "Russian in schools and kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere from the beginning."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on God.
Allah will show you the way out of this situation,” he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
“That’s why we switched to Russian for four years,” the imam says.
He believes that in the Tatar language the sermons will "reach to a narrower circle and will not reach the whole audience."
But we will submit to the decision of the Plenary.
The outcome of the sermon will be different.
But time will tell.
“It will be easier for me, for example, because Tatar is my native language,” Galiullin concluded.
Former director of the FSIN put on trial
The Prosecutor’s Office of Moscow has approved the indictment on the criminal case of embezzlement of budget funds allocated for the needs of the Federal Tax Service of Russia.
The former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy will appear before the court, causing damage to the FSIN in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office sent a criminal case to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court against the former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolay Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal Penitentiary Information Technology and Communications Center of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSUE CITOS) Viktor Determinov.
Depending on the role and the degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Code of Moscow under part 3 of article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers, with serious consequences), part 4 of article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using their official position, as part of an organized group, on a particularly large scale).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Part 1 of Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and possession of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury budget funds allocated to the FSIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems of controlled persons, the so-called electronic bracelets.
For the theft of budget money, the group members developed a scheme according to which the enterprise controlled by them, FSUE CITOS, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and sold at prices that were overstated several times.
Despite the fact that FSUE CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production facilities, allowing to create a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", five state contracts worth more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded between him and FSIN of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, the accounts of the Samara branch of FSUE were more than 2 billion rubles, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles. cashed funds received personally Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case in respect of which is allocated to separate proceedings.
Nikolai Kryvolapov, who participated in the machinations, was found of unknown origin of the bullet to the award pistol, which allowed him to bring additional charges.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim against the accused for compensation for material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.
Footballer Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of the former football player and then member of parliament Hakan <0xC5><0x9E>ukur and conducted searches in two of his family’s homes.
Turkish football star of the 1990s - early 2000s striker Hakan Shukur is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with the attempted coup last month.
The forward, who retired in 2008, is accused of belonging to an “armed terrorist group”.
We are talking about the Hizmet movement, a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious figure and oppositionist Fethullah Gülen.
It is his President Erdogan believes that the organizer of the attempted military coup, which occurred on July 15.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, the Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media, today was issued a warrant for the arrest of Hakan <0xD0><0xA8><0xD1><0x83><0xD0><0xBA><0xD1><0x8E><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB0>, the police have already conducted searches in two houses that belong to the family of the former footballer.
According to the investigation, the organization of Fethullah Gülen, in addition to Hakan Shukur himself, included his father.
However, neither the former footballer nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".

Yegor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for foreign films,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made annually, of which the screens reach an average of 20-25 tapes.
“Even for them it’s very difficult to compete with Transformers and Iron Man, which have huge budgets,” he said.
On July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began its work in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian directions from all over Russia and a number of countries of the near and far abroad.

“Today, together with the Minister of Sports of Russia Vitaly Mutko visited the construction site, with us was the General Director of Metrostroy Vadim Alexandrov.
He said he would hand over the stadium by December 26.
This is a serious St. Petersburg company, it never violates the deadlines.
Vitaly Mutko and I were satisfied with what we saw and heard," the source said.
Earlier, Vitaly Mutko arrived in St. Petersburg to inspect the venue of the upcoming large-scale competitions.

In Miassa (Chelyabinsk region) detained the lawyer of the former deputy governor Nikolai Sandakov Konstantin Akulich.
As reported by "U-South Ural" another lawyer of the accused - Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulich today summoned to the investigative department of the SCR Miass to charge in the case of a year ago about beatings.
Then Konstantin Akuli<0xC4><0x87> went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of its participants.
"Initially, it was instigated against unidentified persons. Now, when he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulich," - says Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akuli<0xC4><0x87> became a lawyer for the former deputy governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the summons of a lawyer in Miass, the defense was informed that on Monday the deadline for acquaintance with the materials of the fraud case, in which Nikolai Sandakov is accused, expires.
Recall that two criminal cases have been initiated against Nikolai Sandakov.
As part of the first (the case of fraud) he is charged with a promise for 1.5 million rubles. to promote the appointment of the mayor of Magnitogorsk head of the administration of Ozersk Evgeny Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns a bribe, which Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the director of the PITON PLC, Igor Kalugin, in the form of illegal unpaid provision of property services in the amount of at least 1.3 million rubles.
Read more about the case of Mr. Sandakov in the material "Kommersant" "The former vice-governor demands the unification of his affairs."
The Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMC has undertaken the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally "dirty" enterprises in the country - the Karabakh copper smelting plant.
The Karabash Coppermelting Plant was founded by an English joint stock company headed by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was an important industrial enterprise for the economy of the country, and it actually provided the vital activity of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which entailed serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the operation of the Karabakh copper smelting plant.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already infamous as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company was transferred to the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually began to reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in the first days of July.
The head of the Southern Urals called the grandiose changes that have occurred with the enterprise since Karabashmed moved to the RMK group.
The main event for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years was the construction of a new sulphuric acid workshop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company Vsevolod Levin, the investment in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of CJSC "Karabashmed" is the reconstruction of the converter division.
The replacement of three converters, sprayers, gas pipeline is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment plant worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes paid to the budget of the city of Karabash will increase.
For the entire period of the implementation of the project of the Tominsky GOK - from the beginning of construction until the commissioning of the second stage - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the commissioning of the GOC, the receipt of taxes to the budgets of all levels can be 80.9 billion rubles.
During the year of production in the Varna district, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to the budgets of different levels.
And this is for the first year.
“The longer the company operates successfully, the amount of deductions may be greater,” added Valery Ulanovsky.
In 2015, the tax deductions from the Mikheevsky GOK approached 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RMC enterprises in the life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
RMC enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, landscaping territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabakh was a major overhaul, and in fact - almost complete restructuring of the kindergarten N9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in emergency condition.
Also on the territory of RMK Arena there will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking for 600 car seats, cafes and sports shops.

In the comments, "innovation" was dubbed "budget tower" and "mobile springboard".

However, one of the commentators on the portal Pikabu noted that it is impossible to judge the depth of the sea from the image.
“Firstly, we don’t know what the depth is, the beach can be bulky with a sharp descent of a meter just behind the stairs, and secondly, even if there is a meter of depth, with proper skill you can jump from a couple of meters,” wrote the user under the nickname C0JIbAMDJZ.

WSJ: The United States is considering imposing sanctions against Russia because of the hacking of the servers of the Democrats.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the Democratic Party’s servers, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.
To impose sanctions, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to formally accuse Russia of attacking servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to the sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia’s involvement in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that the US usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hacking of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which the DPRK was officially charged.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
Initially, it was directed against China, but can also be used against other countries.
The process of deciding on sanctions can be lengthy, the publication writes.
Even if the officials concluded that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, before deciding on the disclosure of information, they will have to weigh the possible consequences.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama allows the possibility of imposing sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked the servers of the national committee of the Democratic party.
WikiLeaks has published an email from the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities, may be involved in the hack.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the distortion of competition in the market of mobile applications.
Antitrust proceedings were initiated at the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components on terms that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular, from Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and established that the company abused its dominant position in the market and imposed on mobile device manufacturers the installation along with the Google Play Store of other applications.
According to the results of the inspection, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, Deputy Head of the FAS Alexey Dotsenko said.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the decree.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the law on protection of competition.
In turn, Google intends to first examine the decision and only then determine the next steps: to implement it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violation of competition law in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google has not given its consent.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement.
This measure will lead to nothing.
This opinion "Echo of Moscow" was expressed by the leading analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat's Anime Effect Criticized as Cartoon for Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
With the Lenses tool, Snapchat allows approximately 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a Roy Liechtenstein painting.
Lenses are rough, curved features tools that create more than 30 million adjusted selfies per day.
Any mistakes quickly become well-known.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past for being accused of promoting dark facial skin or encouraging bleached faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that endowed them with slanted eyes, crooked teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics saw it as a racist caricature of Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions pointed to the company’s more serious diversity-related problem.
Messages spread on Wednesday followed by outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was conceived as a tribute to the characters of the anime, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to experts who know about racism, the lens reminded offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was actively shared, said the lens was “offensive and at least awkward.”
She added that “it’s hard to argue with the comparison side by side of a very rough cartoon on Asians and the filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowish-yellow, but extremely demeaning yellowish-yellowish.
Snapchat isn’t the only company crossing these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And a huge audience of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — may mean they’re more likely to wait to be understood.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, 25-year-old Cathy Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, “it’s much harder for this course of events to go unnoticed, as it used to be.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes racial differences are the reason for the lack of diversity in recruitment in Snepchat.
Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly white, male-only leadership and ended her post with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who is herself an American of Chinese descent, wrote: "Either they did not have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people, but they do not hold positions where it is safe and open to speak."
Other commentators share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its staff, but a confidant said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and active efforts to engage domestic resources.
For her part, Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say it’s not going to work.”
Military leadership distorted intelligence about ISIS, says the committee of Congress
U.S. Central Command officials have altered intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground warrant, a congressional commission said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report by a task force set up by the Republican chairmen of the House Committee on Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee, and the Military Appropriations Subcommittee found “widespread discontent” among Central Command intelligence analysts who claim that Islamic leaders have manipulated their assessments of U.S. actions.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by CENTCOM’s top command tended to provide a more optimistic picture of U.S. counterterrorism activities than confirmed by real-world data and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies,” the report said.
“What happened at the CENTCOM is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with an unreliable analysis, our military suffers,” said Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Problems with management in the CENTCOM reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report examines in detail the shortcomings that constantly occurred in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain conclusive evidence that members of the Obama administration leadership ordered the reports to be falsified, it argues that analysts felt the CENTCOM leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than the actual events,” the report said.
For example, a CENTCOM official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at recapturing Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“After months of investigation, we know for sure,” said Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top U.S. Central Command intelligence officials forged command intelligence documents to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report released on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
Additional, unfinished, investigation of the intelligence of the CENTCOM is conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States released on Thursday their own data, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, the CENTCOM created an overly closed process for conducting intelligence assessments on ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic Party’s chief representative on the committee.
The procedure, Schiff said, “stopped the release of intelligence documents,” damaged the morale of analysts and “insufficiently reflects divergent views.”
But Schiff and the Democrats say they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force CENTCOM analysts to tailor their findings to “a given or political interpretation.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by the portal The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon’s chief inspector, opened after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as the chief inspector’s investigation continues.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree when interpreting complex data, and the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security issues."
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing of Iraq and Syria is achieving its goal (as more and more defense officials are now claiming).
But last year’s announcements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on Central Command providing truthful estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State echoes a controversy that took place more than a decade ago when CENTCOM intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that President George W. Bush’s administration, because of the protests of many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think about what would follow in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest sparked by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on Islamic State-owned refineries did not lead to a significant deterioration in the terrorist group’s financial situation because it built a temporary oil refinery market to sell oil for oil.
But the discovery was not disseminated outside Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then CENTCOM commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testifying in the Senate, which many MPs deemed an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins 4 consecutive women's field hockey, thus approaching the decisive fight with Britain
Once scoring three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam opened the score on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans defeated the Indian team 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, says she’s not sure she’d ever do anything like that.
"I won't mind," she said.
I’m not really one of those people who tracks their goals.
Here’s what she knows: The 4-0 Americans in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan lost 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualify for the quarterfinals, and the outcome of the game will determine who will take first place in their group of six teams, and who will take second place.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from the Netherlands, the leaders of the other group, a little weather when the games of the quarterfinals begin.
However, Saturday’s game shows that the Americans here made noise with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a hockey stick when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the final round.
Then came 2012 when things were not going well for her and her teammates.
The following year, Koeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical fitness,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the productivity in London that we have now.
We completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the score in the first half of the game with a throw from an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India approached the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative in her own hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and sharply sent the ball into the goal, thereby giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa González added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry win was the first in the tournament for US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's in trouble.
Same as Bam.
"We are in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games - "zen" of trampoline jumping
Wherever you are, no matter how much time you have now, this is the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem immutable and unavoidable, it is a frenzied combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic flame itself, it is that burning torch that is passed from archer to swimmer, to gymnast, to triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors’ conversations in a cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Cloe.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who first competed in the Olympics, a handsome man with holes on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in Olympic trampoline jumping competitions.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shadows, are those sports that are not generally recognized: shooting with a pneumatic pistol, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long reign to him.
But if I am allowed to speak shyly in defense of my personal preference, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of trampoline jumping.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they made their debut at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that they were an Olympic sport at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in trampoline jumping, and their athletes did not make it to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians tend to share men’s awards, while Chinese and Canadians share women’s awards.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumps have the charm of an outsider, in particular because for the unenlightened ear they are more associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must admit that I am not an expert, but only a grounded enthusiast.
They do have comic potential — it’s the cartoon flicker of endless jumps — but also the elegance of gymnastics and water jumps, the two sports that they basically combine.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word “el trampolín” which means “the trampoline for jumping into the water”.
Contenders for victory jump on a giant trampoline, taking off in the air by almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic stunts (turns, bends and flips) before final landing on their feet.
They are judged by performance, complexity and “flight time” according to the official Olympic Games program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is ahead.
Candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth on the field.
They aspire not only to the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in front of the cameras, to another teasing frontier: the world or Olympic record.
This stubborn aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to make even the viewer tear.
I think it’s a bit boring to watch the games.
From him, jumping on a trampoline gives a break.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And they, of course, do not do without competition or difficulties, but throughout the whole program there is no mad zeal for the finish line, no jumps in length, only a wonderful, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
This is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1 p.m. Eastern European time; men's - on Saturday, also at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the daytime program starting at 2:00 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic madness, a quiet, beautiful moment is expected that can easily be overlooked in the general dump.
And if awareness growth can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to desirable views and objectification – as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States – Dooley is just waiting for his new enthusiastic crowd of fans.
"Generation protests" in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of splitting?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a staunch ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to more and more of its territory.
Over the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights defenders said the government’s reaction was brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage of the protests, supposedly taken late last year or earlier this year, shows security officers beating young people with sticks when they were put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It’s always been hard to keep this country from falling apart, and it’s going to be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy – human rights organizations constantly mention government repression – the opposition on the territory of the state was stopped, at the expense of the fact that the dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that could change.
“If people are constantly being repressed and left with no choice but to protest, there will be an uprising,” said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation protested.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the government party and its allies have completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are growing; the struggle for that uncertain, contentious border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, are erupting now.
The first, it would seem, is completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and the Internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find an opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said it was how they organized the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amharas from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that's also changing.
“We will act together under a single leadership,” said Mulatto Gemechu, leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of the Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of concern is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at recognising the first signals of discontent and used scouts to obtain data and neutralize opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalen, appeared out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a Southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said was an election that the government stalled and then faked the results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia’s leaders for the forward-looking development of infrastructure such as the new long-distance train and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growth of internal discontent with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked businesses owned by Tigray, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming overwhelming.
Analysts say the protesters are embarrassing the United States and other Western allies.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose strength in an already unstable region.
“And it’s going to be hard to get through this tightrope,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to disguise the latest conflict that swept his campaign on Friday, claiming he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to address the American people sensibly.
It also put his deputies, who were trying to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Speaking at a congress on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really meant to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just sneaking away.
This post was the exact opposite of the statement made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusations.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remarks by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not seize the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted as Trump tried to reorient his campaign to the economy amid a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton delivered competing speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to the topic.
Again resorting to Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to higher taxes, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he drew general criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton’s e-mail, he later explained his remarks, saying, “Of course I’m joking.”
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing some messages that are resonating with his fans, watching how they act, and then ‘explaining’ them one way or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is cautious in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening his remarks for the broad electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days as his ratings continue to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist ranking published on Friday showed that Trump is second to Clinton with a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and is on a par with her in Florida.
While Trump tends to try not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has been the focus of attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump’s most prominent deputies, made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is an acceptable political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it a no-threat, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it happened, because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most average Republicans claim that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop because it failed to settle the situation in the Middle East.
Before the rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for smearing his every word and biasing him.
He mocked the “poor unfortunate” TV experts who were trying to figure him out and said, “They’re weak!”
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump’s excuses as further proof that he is not fit to be president.
Once displaced coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
Willow Coffee House was a ragged, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn’t have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced out of her room with a showcase on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Sherry, which replaced Willow in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in the renewed city.
Artist Molly Krabapple tweeted: “New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Willow is now a soap store.”
But even though New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is renewed.
The revived Willow Coffee House opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new “Willow” has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
And coffee is still good.
At the head of the new "Willow" is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Willow in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said that he would gladly go for it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, left much as it was.
Willow works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same model of the coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Willow".
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu features bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, and toppings of capers or fried onions are available.
There are brown rice dishes.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now they make freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady flow of old regulars.
“Many former customers were also squeezed by prices from Williamsburg,” he said.
On one recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, had previously lived in Williamsburg and frequented the Willows.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still stopped by.
After Willow closed, she said she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Willow,” she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, although that day instead of the usual ice coffee she ordered blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a devoted visitor to Willow since 2003.
He came in before work and ordered the same thing invariably.
“At fifteen o’clock every day, like clockwork, I came, and my bagel was made with butter and all the stuffing,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes into the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but someday he will change something with the help of bacon, egg or cheese on a bagel with all the stuffing.
Rodriguez said he was not offended that the soap store once took over the old place.
What’s more, the owners of “Soup Sherry” offered to make a special soap for “Willow”, using coffee from the cafe, prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
“I think we might agree to their offer,” Rodriguez said.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also chose this coffee house.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for him in the showcase so that his new neighbors would feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local juice retailer plans to bottle and sell cold-cooked coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will attach to the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Willow" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Witt was a regular and shared that he was grief-stricken when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had come home.
“How long have I wanted to smell this,” he said.
Depressed food depression in the "Double Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after assuming the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to dine in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and Maryland tortoise soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert - plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in food history.
Koua’s last book, “Chinese Ragu,” was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a rented apartment on the Lower East Side through a meal in her book, “House 97 on Fruit Garden Street.”
Their new collaborative work, “Flat Meal,” to be published Tuesday by Harper Publishing, is a story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a tiny, simple diner in the Flatiron Quarter that has been in operation since 1929, the year of the Stock Exchange crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and a sandwich with slices of olives, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When a reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple thought it was a good starting point to discuss food in the Depression era.
“Roulettes were in great demand,” Siegelmann said.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed to stretch the ingredient.
Imagine eating as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe's wrinkled.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a buffet.
Groups of women cooked for the male farm workers, and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "The Dense Meal" describes how the country coped with what suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, challenging topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as difficult was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and casseroles, became staple foods; casseroles are a “great way to dispose of scraps,” Ziegelman noted, “because cooks could hide unsightly ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for many years was the basis of American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because the energy and nutritional value has become more important than the taste and even culinary common sense.
Researching for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman cooked a dish of the era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
“This addition to the dining table has not been successful,” Coe said.
Siegelman added: "It was very strange."
Peanut butter is not suitable for liver onions.
This was typical of many household recipes.
As never before, and never since, household economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget makers”, take the challenge and transform burdocks like grated spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
The "Flat Meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy stories about the government’s reaction to starving citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of “let them eat cakes”.
Publicly praising Iowa's simple farmer's stove during his childhood, he fed like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
“He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate practically in the gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with her own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste, and this led to the fact that the White House "used not only the saddest food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the culinary techniques of the Depression were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Siegelmann says, and how science has been used in cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they had a better understanding of mother Siegelmann’s eating habits — that she couldn’t throw away food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of negligent food,” Coe said.
Siegelmann recalls: "She seriously poisoned people."
There was one unpleasant case with profitrolls.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, she and Coe got a dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called plum mousse,” Siegelman said, adding that it was a common technique to give modest recipes catchy names.
There was no whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe asked for supplements twice.
With the voice of a confident budget maker, he told his wife: "A little chopped walnuts would do here."
The arrest of the defendants of the case about the mass brawl at the Khovan cemetery extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left the defendants in the case of the mass brawl at the Khovansky cemetery under arrest until November 14, granting the relevant request of the investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
Recall that on May 14 at the Khovan cemetery there was a mass fight of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons, as a result of which three people died.
Former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov was charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was announced on August 12 by Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters on how much we need to increase pensions in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Now the economists are summing up the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks,” said Golodets.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Developments Alexei Kudrin to increase the retirement age by six months each year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Cabinet does not consider this topic.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan went to the final of the competition in shooting from a small-caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan went to the final of the competition in shooting from a small-caliber rifle from a lying position at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points and took the first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan was second - 628.9 was.
In total, eight of the best athletes went to the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen is demanding an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup," Gulen was quoted as saying by the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that “if any of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey.”
However, Gulen denies any involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization never claimed political power.
A court in Istanbul earlier arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen in absentia.
An attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead to reimburse lawyers in hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement for the costs of lawyers it has incurred in connection with a dispute over a patent for a hepatitis C drug with drug maker Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of $200 million in damages for violating two of Merck’s drug patents related to Gilead, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations by Merck, including sworn lies and other unethical conduct.
In court on Thursday, U.S. District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to reimbursement for costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the lab work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed armed forces claim to have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
The US-backed armed forces seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the allied SDF military council in Manbij told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are undertaking cleaning operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton on Friday unveiled her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speech fees, and the former Secretary of State claimed $3 million in revenue from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, has released tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind fake excuses and breaks his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have cited the State Tax Service’s audit as a reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
“Your move,” Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate’s declarations.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until after the checks.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed onto the issue and released an online video on Friday highlighting prominent Republicans who persuaded Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades without exception: publish his tax returns,” she said.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as saying the case may still be that way.
Federal tax rates have become a matter of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, suggested Trump meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, was under scrutiny by the IRS and that Trump was “afraid” not of the tax collecting agency, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was an inexpensive index mutual fund, and the Clintons claimed $109,000 in dividends and capital gains.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase protection for Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from sneaking into populated areas - throwing condoms filled with chili powder into them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. Conservation Committee, took over its promotion, training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we invented the toolkit ... we’ve seen a shift in attitudes within these communities, making them far more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants,” said Damian Bell, Honeyguide’s executive director.
The first two steps are to light a torch in front of the border crossing elephant and signal with a horn.
If it failed to scare him away, then throw the so-called "chili cloud".
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a flake in a condom, and its end is twisted, only the wick remains on the outside.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a rumble, spraying fine dust of chili powder in the air.
One breath is usually enough to turn an elephant in the other direction.
The ultimate measure is a launcher that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey since the coup attempt in July.
Such data was given by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu in an interview with local journalists.
In the first stage, we recalled 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations,” the Turkish Foreign Minister said.
Recall that in July in Turkey there was an attempted coup.
The authorities of the country officially stated that the coup failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them military ranks of the highest and middle level.
As a result of the coup attempt, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 290 people died.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing the phone code of Israel at the “request” of the Arabs – reported the channel RT News
A French Jewish filmmaker unleashed a media scandal when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli phone code on the list, with employees citing “requests” from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary The Shoah, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel in a list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states to which you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to dial Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel’s reception desk.
The response he received there, according to Lanzman, “shocked him.”
A hotel clerk said the measure was "a deliberate decision by the Kempinski hotel chain management."
The reason behind this step caused even more anger of the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they have demanded that the Israeli code be removed,” Lanzman said.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadass-Handelsmann, called the incident a “terrible disgrace,” according to the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible disgrace.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain is even more shameful.
There is no need for explanations here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the official said.
The case caused considerable resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that the Kempinski hotel simply "followed" the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“You would be ashamed,” another post said, pointing out that the hotel, located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street, is next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to dismiss any accusations, calling the incident “negligence” and “sorry” to Lanzmann, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of quick recruits,” a spokesman for the Kempinski hotel told the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students protesting
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to proposals by São Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be reassigned to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim president Michael Temer on the walls.
The latest protest came just days after protesters took to the streets to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, according to the portal RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year’s record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which preserve the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to twist the nuts in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic non-fulfillment” of the instructions of the CEO of the concern “Almaz-Antey”, “failure to work” and “loss of trust”.
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of NGOs for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause widespread media coverage.
How to explain such silence in the context of a large-scale re-equipment of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the defense-industrial complex has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of bringing order to the industry.
NGO "Almaz" - the main enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM) sea and land based.
Currently, "Almaz" is working on the creation of the "Polyment-Redut" and "Morpheus" air defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov caused by the failure of deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morpheus" began in 2007, and commissioning was expected in 2013.
"Polyment-Redut" should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, in the course of several years of testing, not a single truly successful test has been carried out.
However, as far as I can judge, there is no unequivocal fault of “Diamond”, – said Kornev.
The expert fears that a delay in commissioning may also occur with the S-500 air defense system.
The development work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should enter the troops.
The Defense Ministry assures that "work is being carried out in a planned manner and everything will be completed in due time", although in 2014 the department recognized the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led Diamond since 2011.
Kornev noted that interruptions in the deadlines for projects can be both the reason and the reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the defense industry and plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as you know, love silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies resign at will, by agreement of the parties or transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension took place publicly, although it received no resonance.
This suggests that the leader of the "Diamond" was probably a stubborn figure and resisted descending from the top of the "discharge".
It seems that the state no longer intends to tolerate such behavior.
With the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Ministry of Defense and do not perform the tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish rogue managers (tricks at the shipyard "Zvezda").
The President personally pays attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and holds periodic meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the defense industry managers, seeking to have at hand a loyal composition of directors who will carry out the orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but against the backdrop of rampant corruption and the lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state has no other tools.
The current situation in the defense industry, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of the managers in the defense industry, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the ascension to the post of Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted the well-known saying “If you want peace, prepare for war”.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union's military might and nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which cemented Moscow's spheres of influence on the continent.
With all the disadvantages of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
The proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the “winners” in the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", perhaps, there is not a single quiet corner.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the navy and the army.
Strengthening military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers in world politics.
Scottish Callum Skinner races on the finish line, as a result of which the British seize the cycling gold
Scottish Callum Skinner raced to victory in the men's team sprint at the Rio cycling circuit last night, as a result of which the British team trio defended their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the strongest, which his friend Scottish Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly made history, rushing down the finish line to snatch the victory from the favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed rights to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed rights to the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, despite the fact that Hoi has since ended his career.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of specialist participant Jamie Staff.
They did so just at the time Hindes appeared.
Hoi’s departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scotsman that was now realised.
Hindes, Kenny – champions with Hoy four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner supported.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes drove on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as a BBC guest expert and caught Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes' eye as they stepped onto the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: “This is a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After triumphing in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes confessed to deliberately falling onto the track after an unsuccessful start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal from UK competitors.
There was no such question this time in the great victory.
Hindes said: "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the podium."
We’ve all met as a team in the last three months.
We have lost so many races with a worldwide reputation that it was amazing to win the Olympics again.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the bikedrome is waiting for another five successful days.
With the form shown by Kenny, it’s not beyond the possibility of imagining how he replicates Hoya’s feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
That would see Kenny—who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister)—raise his score to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be just like Hoi.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and runs for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I’m just enjoying it right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted.”
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dooll are the fastest four-kilometer team chase in the race.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record set for winning gold in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (10:42 pm) will take place today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be the center of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
In the respective women’s event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rousell Shand, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie improved the world record, showing a time of 4:13,260.
Team Britain has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take possession of the middle period of the Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
After in fact exceptional demonstrations of total supremacy in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not the last - the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the race of the first evening on the cyclodrome, it seems that the legendary now-UK glory in reaching the tops at the right time may just repeat itself again.
Future of Portland Steel Works Threatened by Termination of Electricity Contract
The future of Portland’s aluminum plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is at risk as the power company that supplies the plant, according to one plant owner, is about to terminate the supply contract: all supply contracts are planned to be terminated.
The move follows a decision earlier this year by the Victorian government not to renew subsidies provided to support the plant’s operation.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa’s Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs – directly and indirectly – could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry metallurgical plant, leading to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland metallurgical plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, lasting for several years, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later - because of the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contract.
The joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina owns a controlling stake in the plant, while China’s CITIC and Japan’s Marubeni Corp own smaller stakes.
“AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, the aforementioned contracts are so-called “hedged contracts” that were supposed to come into effect in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of revenue in fiscal 2017,” the company said in a statement.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million due to an “imminent termination”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a steel plant or ensure the supply of electricity to a steel plant.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect in November this year, but it still has to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland steel plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL’s chief operating officer Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the market [electricity].
For us, as a manufacturer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only the star of the reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, manager mother Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and debuted at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, said the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“While in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news of the cover was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the "Kardashian Family"?), prepared reality video in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshire Rob and Caitlin, also joined them the most beloved uncle of show business, the producer of the "Kardashian Family" - the star of the show, the producer of the "Kardashian" Ryan Sikreyan).
This is the standard storyline of almost all children's birthday TV shows (Screwster utters the phrase, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the 8:00 a.m. show), but Chris needed this fame to go to other girls anyway.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Kendall Kim’s older sister had been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling issue of the year.
Thickly similar to a gift edition rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the calculations of the portal Fashionista, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertising).
News about which of the stars will be on his cover is expected with such impatience that in the last two years photos of the magazine merged before the official announcement.
The previous women on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover certainly featured more “celebrities who work as models” than “models who are celebrities.”
Oscar-winning Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as an “outstanding model” of her generation, falls into the first category, she is in good company.
These celebrities aren’t relatives of famous people, reality stars, or modern-day kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who are thriving in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover of last year, this year was one of the most successful in her career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, due to her past star of the TV reality show, always had to remain shaky.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret's first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment".
These sentiments again stirred after the news of the appearance of Jenner on the cover of Vogue.
But it makes no sense to be obsessed with dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's parading for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a Estee Lauder tone cream.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available on a paid subscription.
She sells self-made photographs of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality TV show.
Public legal centers refuse to serve 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 least-protected members of the population are denied service in public legal centers, as the sector prepares for an effect that will have further cuts in funding for activities that are already at the limit of their capabilities.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly the elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unjust deprivation of property, and so on—have already been denied free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, already operating beyond capacity, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland’s Public Law Centers, said that according to the latest census by the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people are rejected each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not reversed, the situation will only worsen.
“Queensland’s public legal centers are continually underfunded: that means thousands of people are denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People withdrawing from violent relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families going through divorce, unfairly fired workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less protected residents of Queensland will be forced to tackle complex legal issues without help.
We call on Queensland Secretary of Justice and Senator George Brandis to immediately revoke these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign has been sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump’s campaign was sued: the campaign allegedly did nothing after reports that his North Carolina operations director threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state’s campaign headquarters.
Bordini said he had waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that "this will not happen".
Director Earl Phillip “took out the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the gun at Vincent’s kneecap,” Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people were involved in similar incidents with Phillip.
“Pistoles don’t have to shoot to inflict damage,” Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after a Republican presidential candidate made a fuss by telling audiences in North Carolina that “second-amendment people” — understood as gun owners and gun lovers — could take action if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could elect judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for negligent control, and from Phillip for threats of physical violence, insults by action and infliction of moral harm.
Trump’s representative, Hope Hicks, is hesitant to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Philip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Division of the High Court for the District of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring rebirth and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, that was a huge advantage for Heathrow, just as it was for London in 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our nationalities and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics have brought tremendous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again, creating opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the Heathrow expansion task is too ambitious.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be proved wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in a timely manner and within budget, from T5, the airport’s top terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world’s two busiest runways.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I’m sure the Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time for us to direct the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow by securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton – Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Treasury Trade Attaché
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing “cat-mouse” on the issue of blocking ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass ad-blocking software are a cat-and-mouse game, according to one company that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims it was able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the open source ad blocker community and those trying to bypass it has continued since the invention of ad blocking,” and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of how big an issue ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to last year’s study by Pagefair and Adobe; nearly four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a lucrative enough article for Facebook to consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its “ad preferences” tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted.
Facebook said on Thursday that the new Adblock filters are a concern as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to address this issue,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a rough tool, so we’ve instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people’s hands.
A woman was killed on a Swiss highway in an apparent suicide.
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are summoning witnesses after a woman was driven over by several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Walrus in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of desperation" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several involved drivers have already been interviewed, but the identity of some has not yet been established, police said, calling on them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a "logical" step in this situation, said lawyer Gilles Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the blow?
That’s what the prosecutor should determine,” Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both involving a person walking in the dark on the highway — a verdict was handed down that motorists could not expect an accidental encounter with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of negligent death after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne on the night of August 2014.
22-year-old victim drank and fainted on the road, heard the court.
The court found that the policewoman — who responded to the emergency call — was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near Walrus should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates from NASA’s new climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and carbon-saturated atmosphere, could ever have conditions similar to Earth's.
Scientists had previously assumed that Venus's low rotational speed was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modelling suggests that Venus could probably have had a rarefied Earth-like atmosphere and still rotate slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimer.
"According to the GISS model, Venus' slow rotation replaces its day side with the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio explained in a press release.
This warms the planet’s surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella that protects the planet’s surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are surprisingly a few degrees colder than on Earth today.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously assumed by experts in the study of planets.
Although Venus may have once been habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flew away, all that remained was a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey at Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team’s decision-making process.
Executive Vice President / Chief Executive Officer of the Colorado team Joe Sakic confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have served as coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
During the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must ideally coincide with the vision of the organization.
He must also have a voice in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award for Best League Coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs for the past two years.
The Avalanche team announced a 39-39-4 for the 2015-2016 season and was five points behind the Wild team in the fight for a second concession to participate in the Western Conference.
A goaltender from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups—two each with the Montreal Canadiens and one with the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Resume Talks and Suspend Strike
Workers' strikes on the issue of salaries of oil workers in the North Sea have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are starting a new round of negotiations, leading representatives of the parties said.
Strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes,” the statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was against potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The company’s rate cuts came after a 10 percent cut in rates for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to cut oil and gas operations in countries to 10, as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling crude oil prices: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to leave the European Union made in June by the United Kingdom.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts that has arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some,” he said.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The Kepler space telescope’s latest mission has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive catalog of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how periods of rotation correlate with the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our findings with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the star’s mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades are 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They are spinning as fast as they will never be again.
At their peak rotation speeds, these mature stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have an inhibitory effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable stellar spots — such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: the larger ones make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades' ballet, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually very light stars," Riball said.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with the speeds of rotation.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both young and old," Riball said.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why stars slow down and hang their “dance shoes” on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades’ rotational speeds in three new papers that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
An investigation into the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea is being conducted by two agencies, Kommersant reports.
The FSB is collecting evidence of the detainees’ involvement in the preparation of sabotage in Crimea.
As previously reported, confessions were made by a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for sabotage, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armeniansk, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all accomplices of the saboteurs managed to be detained.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
The head coach of the Russian national football team became Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be designed for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the Executive Committee of the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a famous football player who previously played in the Moscow "Spartacus" as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a mentor of such Russian teams as the same "Spartacus", "Pearl-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynamo", as well as the Warsaw "Legia", which became the winner of the national championship and Cuba.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is he who has the duty to prepare the national team for the 2018 world championship.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information according to which the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the leadership of the RFU set Stanislav Cherchesov the goal to bring the Russian national team to the semi-finals and win medals.
As the coach himself said, as a priority, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov, the Russian national team will hold on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching at the club CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the national team of Russia at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the team on himself.
Squeezed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, the country with a population of 2.4 million has made huge strides, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take free primary and secondary education for granted, in many poor countries secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees to “recover costs”.
However, primary schooling is free in Namibia.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The country’s authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past ten years.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, a standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate dropped from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also declined, from almost 53 percent to less than 23 percent.
Namibia also has the highest rating of freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was well ahead of the United States and other wealthy nations.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating – one of the highest in Africa – in the “Corruption Perceptions Index” compiled by human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, with commodity prices falling, Namibia has managed to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the level of debt in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional valuation methods, remains fairly high, at almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, with almost 17 per cent of the population being infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is an upper-middle-income country, but authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
On the territory of the country in the deserts live isolated nomad tribes of hunter-gatherers, which in one way or another should be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia does not think to give up, the country is solving the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that rival political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical services not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical facilities in the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibians realized that the neighbors were not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, participate in regional medical projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Namibian government has rightly reasoned that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that the revenues from Namibia’s natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profit from the sale of a country’s resources, and they are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that’s the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why strong government support for freedom of expression is so important.
As noted by the head of state Hage Geingob, the media often say what he does not like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has gained, the president says.
Not all of Namibia’s key resources are exhaustible.
Some - such as fishing - are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious deficiencies -- racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development -- can embark on the path to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard about the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps this was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one burial, known as "Tomb No. 43", was extracted 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon move to a seemingly unpretentious beads found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsi.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Yunatsit is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunatsit of Pazardzhik district.
The beads are a gold stripe rolled into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiyev, the head of the excavations at Tell Yunatsit, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it is older than the gold of Varna by at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date from about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
Technologies that allow to date metal with impeccable accuracy do not currently exist.
How do you know which gold is more ancient?
Obviously, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am quite sure that the gold of the Yunatsi is older than the gold of Varna."
It’s a discovery of extreme importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it’s big enough to occupy a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine and more carefully the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the beads with the highest possible accuracy.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yunatsi is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Nowadays, Tell Yunatsite is considered the oldest "city" in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
During the following centuries, metal processing in this region developed rapidly, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the 5th millennium BC around the centers of metalworking began to emerge settlements of the urban type.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunatsit is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts from 4900 BC have been found here.
I would call Tell Yunatsit the prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is a thousand years older than Sumer,” Boyadzhiev says, referring to the conventional belief that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia – modern Iraq.
It was there that the first cities in the usual sense of the word were formed.
Excavations of the Tell of the Youth have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
There is little left of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, a "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay figures of birds have been found here.
All birds are depicted at rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of a local cult.
The "Bird City" was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
Nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-metre-high fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal slaughter: inside the houses were found the remains of old men, women and children with wounds inflicted by combat axes.
New findings and new facts appear every year, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the "Gold of Varna", found relatively recently, in 1972.
Logically, Varna’s golden luxury must have been preceded by something like a tiny gold beads created in the Yunatsit Tell.
Porsche has artificially aged the model 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the division who work with production cars.
"Retro-bow" consists, for example, in a special body color Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - this color is even painted with the model's logo.
In addition, the targa received proprietary white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheels, as well as some details of the bodywork painted in "white-gold metallic".
The interior of the retro lines is noticeably smaller: it differs, by and large, in the gray-blue gamma of the design, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and black anodized steel thresholds with the division logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive as a gift a car case and a richly finished album with photos of the production process.
Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch the power plant: the retro-targa in characteristics is quite the same as the serial one.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S is able to accelerate to 100 km / h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sports car are reported.
Facebook and ad blockers have unleashed an “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the concealment of advertising on the pages of the social network, provoked the developers of solutions to block advertising for response actions.
AdBlock Plus has released an “antidote,” but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Representatives of the social network noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus together with commercial ads blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook regretted such a policy AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among the developers of the social network TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop site Facebook, will be ready in the coming hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of “arms race”, trying to beat each other, the affected party were users who missed interesting posts from friends or saw advertising where they are not used to seeing it.
Ethical aspects of ad blocking have been sparking heated controversy lately.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear before the court <0xC2><0xB7> Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated in the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murmansk region.
The indictment against the 54-year-old man is very serious - the commission of violent acts of a sexual nature.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed acts of sexual nature with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty in the form of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia crossover Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - site Behind the wheel www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 - a representative of the growing popularity in China class of cars, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is a pickup Rich New.
Many Western firms decided to ignore the Moscow International Auto Show this year, so the emptiness of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large views on the Russian market and intends to offer our motorists a number of interesting novelties in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossover, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (a little less than 550,000 rubles at the current rate).
For Russians, such a price tag is unlikely to shine, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, the Fengguang 370 on the results of June sales managed to get to the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans, although due to the large ground clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic casing along the lower perimeter of the body, it can be classified as a crossover.
The Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger Fengguang 360 model, the 370th has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden bars, but the large vertical touch screen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossover, and cars with "music" were on sale more easily.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading area with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the trunk is 1500 liters.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is provided only one - a 1.5-liter gasoline "atmospheric" with a power of 115 hp, docked with a 5-speed manual transmission.
About the dynamic qualities of the car, the manufacturer modestly keeps silent, but promises a budget-saving appetite of the owner at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
Pickup Rich New - is familiar to the Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, but with a slightly ennobled Chinese stylists design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model is still in stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "working horse".
At a similar price, Rich New will surely interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickup trucks have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: gasoline 2.4 l (137 hp) or turbo diesel 2.5 l (116 hp).
Gearbox - only mechanics, drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigidly connected "front".
There will be a new flagship sedan A9 at Dongfeng booth, its Russian premiere was announced by the representative office of the Chinese firm in June.
MinVen-like crossovers in the Chinese market is becoming more and more, one of the latest novelties - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng lineup consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
During the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications on transport tax will stop sending by mail - site Behind the wheel www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate changed the procedure for sending notices on property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the unchanged scheme over the years: in summer and autumn, they receive receipts by mail for the payment of transport tax for the previous year.
However, this year many of them will not wait.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate changed the procedure for notifying citizens without unnecessary noise.
Those who are registered in the "Personal account of the taxpayer" on the official website of the office narodn.ru, notifications will come in electronic form.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians as online users and deleted them from the standard, "paper" mailing list.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will continue to receive the usual letters.
However, the possibility of returning to the old scheme is also available to account holders on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal account" immediately after compilation, while the letter will last several days and may be lost altogether.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in a "personal account" to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, fall into the category of non-payers with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the "Personal account of the taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, using an electronic signature or entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any department of the tax inspection (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
Notifications began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which refinements are aimed at achieving a very high return, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of the company G-Power, who took up the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-strong flying sledgehammer with tank aerodynamics and acceleration to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helician", the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-liter inflatable "eight" opens.
But the dynamics of acceleration to a hundred improved by an indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "brick" is able to burst in 5.3 s.
However, the acceleration from average speeds certainly gives it a noticeably better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not go faster than 210 km / h, then the tuning SUV with a deactivated electronic "collar" is able to squeeze 250 km / h.
The exterior of the car is almost indistinguishable from its original source, with the exception of other wheels - 23-inch Hurricane RR dimensions 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced a striking concept coupe 6 m long, which will be presented in the framework of the Elegance Competition in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green sub-brand” BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand name.
In the coming years, at least four environmentally friendly novelties are expected to appear.
