Members of the Welsh congregation worry that they are “like Muppets”
Some members of the Assembly are outraged by the proposal to rename themselves MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, e.g. Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum worry about being ridiculed.
A Labour member of the assembly said they were concerned in their group “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means poop.
Plenary member Plaid Cymru said their group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested other options.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, while pointing out that there is little difference in pronunciation between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to present name changes, stated: “The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Parliament was empowered by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
For members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name “Welsh Parliament Member” or “WMP”, but in the public consultation the most support was given to the option “MWP”.
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing other options, but reaching a consensus will be a difficult task for the presiding official Elin Jones, who has to submit a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on incompatibility of the performance of the functions of members of the Assembly and the creation of a system of committees.
The members of the Assembly will participate in the final vote on their appointment in the legislative debate.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country’s name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
With the vote, they want to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not heed the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin’s Church have been silenced as Harlem churches struggle
“The older people I spoke to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Not one of them today.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are getting along differently nowadays.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods that people go to on a regular basis.”
In the churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be back to the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with a common administration (condominium), where people will live who will not help the shelters in the neighborhood that remain.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore the day will soon come when all these churches will be closed, as it is unlikely that the people who will move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist church community emigrated in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community that performed a service nearby.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black religious community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of vendors on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who refused to hire or support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered bells to run.
Venerable David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells “bells for the poor.”
The expert, who arrived in July, called them a little differently: “cultural treasure” and “irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these are the first bells to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he taps on larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he had not been replaced at St. Martin's.
In the church of St. Martin’s, a complicated story of architects and contractors has been unfolding over the past few months; some brought by church laymen and others by the diocese.
In July, the parish’s governing body, made up of lay people, wrote to the diocese that it was concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the parish, even though the parish was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
13-year-old shark injured while lobster hunting in California
Officials say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old man in California on Saturday as he was fishing for lobster at the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he and the group swam to him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught a lobster, and then he found himself screaming “He bit me!
“He bit me!”
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
“I shouted to everyone out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
A water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper torso.
Responsible authorities have blocked access for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty corners like they have in supermarkets, and with expert staff.
As part of its entry into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and household appliances decline, larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and next year in more stores if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they used to use for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also gain more space in areas with brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique range of cosmetics, so most of the products are vegan – something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury’s stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
Due to online shopping and daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores will be similar to supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discounters with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has opened Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, boosting food sales and making acquisitions more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate its departments with cosmetics and pharmaceutical products have ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury's embarked on a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the bond ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from drug stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmaceutical company to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in this plan as it expands its range of luxury skincare brands across four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty corners to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be available for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that presents a challenge to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Is “Angry” About Holly Willoughby’s Withdrawal From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
The star of Dragons Den is furious as TV host Holly Willoughby pulls out of her <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their Truly clothing and accessories brand.
The company of the business couple was compared to the brand Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The host of This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby has pissed off Peter Jones’s Dragons Day star as she pulled out of their lucrative lifestyle brand deal at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the TV's golden girl admitted Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company's Marlowe, Buckinghamshire headquarters that due to her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m - she no longer had enough time to devote to their Truly clothing and accessories brand.
They compared the company to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and predicted it would double its assets, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source says: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future to live on for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely stunned everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, because the opening was so close.
At the company’s headquarters in Marlow, the warehouse is full of ready-to-sell goods.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the show This Morning, which is one of the most interesting associations for banks in the UK, the company would cost millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and accessories, and additional delays at the opening.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple were on vacation together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S Brand Ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
It was a hard conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about criticizing the media for a comment that some find “unpresidential” and a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, in his ridiculous “journalism” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim had shown interest in a second meeting, and Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea sees no “appropriate response” from the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing to impose sanctions that continue to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results – they halted missile tests, helped free hostages and brought home the remains of U.S. troops.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of the 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded, crowded scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in dealing with the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs have been told that they do not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was resettled, they did not declare a natural disaster, a prerequisite for sending international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” Sumbung said.
Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palo, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu and deciding whether international agencies will be allowed to help.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are a constant, the country remains completely unprepared for the rage of nature.
While shelters were built in Aceh after the tsunami, this is not a common practice on other shores.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu may have contributed to the loss of life, although the warning was valid.
Traveling among many Indonesian islands is a challenge even in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A sick boat anchored in Lombok to help the victims of the quake is sailing towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of another disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of Indonesia’s destroyed infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit poses a problem for the Jok administration in re-election next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from long-lasting tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores for a late draw against Chelsea
On Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute to save Liverpool from a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 25 metres ahead of Chelsea's goal in a 1–0 lag.
He passed the ball to his left and fired a shot at a distant goal.
The shot traveled high above the penalty area towards the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually dropped over goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I was just trying to get into the right position for the ball and players like Shaq are always pulling it forward as much as they can, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw that Kante was coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much and just decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half with Belgian player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The striker of the Blues in this campaign with a heel handed the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly passed in the middle and ran forward.
Then he made a nice pass through the defense and Hazard ran into the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defense and fired his left foot into a distant goalway through Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the UEFA Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will be playing Videoton in the Europa League at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the quake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings as a result of Friday’s 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which triggered six-meter waves.
Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is dotted with ruins of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
Police have launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging anyone who has been in the area and seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I urge anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the car camera footage, to contact us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police representative confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the crime scene who thought they knew the woman and asked where they had found her this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police are informing the family of the woman.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents were told it could take several hours before they could re-enter.
The police officer was heard explaining to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying, “That’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon, and another just outside.
Many police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with any information is asked to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 with a log 247 dated September 30th.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memorial target of a dispute over "rewriting history"
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical puritans.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick’s proposal “foolishness” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate about the removal of statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace will become a target.”
Iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor in the last century.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft testifies to a 19th-century opinion and is part of the historiography of a personality that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) as the protector of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate representation is the subject of constant historical debate.
It is clear that the dispute in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from his time as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.”
Slaughter pig kills Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the surname “Yuan” was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pig breeders are preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
She and her cousin reportedly traveled from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pigsty with a bloody mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig killed a farmer.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody and mutilated,” a cousin named “Wu” was quoted as saying in Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuang coming to the market at 4.40 a.m. Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are expected to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks by pigs on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with a man suffering serious bodily injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer against a tractor, but then his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“We just want to play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
We just need to show them enough respect,” he said.
Heavy rains are coming to the southwest of the United States due to the remnants of Hurricane Rosa
Hurricane Rosa is projected to move toward the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast and weaken.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa has been a Category 1 hurricane since 5.00 a.m. on Sunday, with winds of 137 km/h and is located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure zone moving east to the west coast of the United States is gaining ground, and the dew will approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, pushing high tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
Dew will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture, which will mix with the low-pressure area, will create heavy rainfall over the wider southwestern area in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, deposition of debris and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to the high tropical humidity, the amount of rainfall in some places will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially over most of Arizona, rainfall is expected from 50 to 100 mm.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the diffuse nature of tropical rains.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms will bring local gusts of wind and dust in the air.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring local rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Precipitation above 12 mm is possible, which can lead to less debris deposition and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region during the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and early Monday morning, and late Monday and Tuesday the rainfall will expand.
Heavy rains will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. could experience high temperature fluctuations as the Arctic cools and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic temperature difference in the central United States.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there is a 20-degree difference.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to settle and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. will enter a warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it could be 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good prospects for above-average temperatures for the east of the US in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the intriguing testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued, as television stations cut off a regular program due to Friday’s last-minute turnaround: a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was groping her in a drunken state and trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a tumultuous testimony that he was 100% sure this had not happened.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people are expected to testify on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership of the television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks broadcasting the testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with counting the viewers watching the program in the office.
For the sake of clarity, the ratings are similar to those of the American Film Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, is ahead of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers when it comes to broadcasting the day-long hearing.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office said it would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, cameras from CNN and CBS on Friday morning filmed protesters yelling at him as he tried to enter the elevator to attend a hearing of the Justice Committee.
During the reprimand, he hung his eyes for a few minutes, which was captured live by the cameras of CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” a woman told him.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office made a statement, adding that he would say more at the committee's hearing, and then the elevator door closed.
All television networks also broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted to hand over Kavanaugh’s appointment to a Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as called for by the Democratic minority party.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of 'playing political games' on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Theresa May at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview besides the one on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, escalated his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay customs to each other was “completely absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to police from Baron Rouge, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims lost their sunglasses during the fight.
Police found the sunglasses at the scene and Simpson’s DNA on them, CBS TV supplementing WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
An East Baton Rouge Parish County coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Special Refugee Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their “care and justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano erupting ash on Mexico City
Ash erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano as activity in the crater intensified and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center observed several cases of thunder and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of the capital city of Mexico City, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized secession vote.
A group of masked separatist supporters held back by counter-attack police units threw eggs at them and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were also fights, with the police having to use batons to stop the clashes.
Pro-independence supporters, who cried out for hours “without forgetting, without forgiving”, faced protesters who supported unity and shouted “Long live Spain!”
Local media reported that 14 people were slightly injured in the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was declared illegal in Madrid and celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region, which supports independence, remain.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, although participation was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the elections.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop the resumption of voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence support groups camped out overnight in front of the polls to prevent demonstrations and support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they were able to vote, but now we’re stuck.”
Despite a significant, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence-supporting parties have struggled to maintain the initiative this year, as many of the most prominent leaders are either in voluntary exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to record a protest in support of police, explained that the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the oppression we have seen with the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry Police Arrest Men Who Hit House With Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly hitting a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building were damaged.
At some point, a crossbow was also fired at the car.
With Mengaj, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga wins first goal for Livingston
Livingston stunned the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as Ibrox coach.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference, as Gary Holt's team equated with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team remained without a away win in this year's championship, and next Sunday they are waiting for Hearts, which leads in the rankings and behind by eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston increased his division draw to six games, and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, had not yet tasted defeat.
Livingston squandered opportunities against direct guests
Holt's team should have led well before the goal, as they caused many problems with their directness to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he threw the ball over the goal frame, then Alan Lithgow struck past the goal, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the goal.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers, knowing that they could be dangerous for the guests during breaks in the attack.
And that’s how they came to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared a campaign for Menga, who fired and hit from the middle of the penalty area.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but could not break through the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos extorted Kelly's defense.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot with his foot, and Lithgow fired past goal from another Livingston break in the attack.
Submissions continued to arrive in Livingston's penal area, but the home team rebuffed all attacks, with two misdemeanors - Halkett's misdemeanor over replacing Glenn Middleton and a misdemeanor for playing with the hand - not ruled by the referee.
“Excellent Performance” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great show and result for Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of the game and the line-up have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt should be credited for the way he has woken the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and had a well-arranged defense, while Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby all the time.
The Rangers lacked the inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under Gerrard’s leadership, they lack these standards.
There was a shortage of shots on goal – only once they successfully beat the defense of the hosts – and this is a kind of wake-up call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the rankings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was welcomed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today marks the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented 25,000 heads of crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters – many Kurds among them – who do not support Erdogan’s government also expressed their opinion and condemned Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect a split about the visitor, who is hailed by some German Turks as a hero, while others despise him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist died in a car crash
In London, a cyclist was killed in a car crash.
The accident occurred near the crossroads between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred just months after a cyclist died in a car driver-escape collision on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident.
Police said they were verifying the man's identity so they could inform his family.
Roadblocks were erected and bus lines diverted, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a heavily guarded male prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30 a.m. British summer time and is still ongoing.
Specialist police officers from the Tornado unit were called in to take care of the riot, which involved eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated for minor injuries to their faces on the spot.
A prison staff representative said: “We have called in specially trained personnel to take care of the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be taken away by the police and may be held even further behind bars as a result.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, a police unit was summoned to the prison to intervene in a serious riot in which staff were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be useful for arid areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa paves its way through the desert's southwest and carries the danger of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to rage over Phoenix on Tuesday, but will approach late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged just 60 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with individual rainfall of up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, 25 to 50 mm of precipitation is expected, individual precipitations of up to 100 mm are possible.
For areas outside the threat of sudden floods, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought period.
“According to a U.S. drought watchdog, as many as 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning still has the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and weakens.
It is expected to reach land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be profuse and therefore pose a high flood risk.
"From the Baja California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with the possibility of 250 mm of rainfall," the weather.com website said.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then travel through Arizona and toward southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall on the Baja California Peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the American southwestern desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These precipitations can cause life-threatening sudden flooding and debris in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4 a.m. British summer time.
He was taken to hospital and his condition remains “stable.”
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are urging anyone who may have caught the incident with their mobile phone to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the unkindness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthlessness and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the unkindness and anger” of the Democratic party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying allegations that Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford testified to her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the day “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage.”
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president implicitly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
Five more weeks until one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m really working on my candidacy,” he said.
“I’m always looking for great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican adviser told CNN.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds of people, death toll rises
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of whom were swept away by giant waves raging along the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday when six-metre waves hit the shore at dusk, taking many to their deaths and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, said at a meeting in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it knocked everything down,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a series of earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is expected to further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater off the coast 300km north of Palu, in the Donggala area closer to the epicentre of the quake.
As Nugroho said, communications have been completely cut off and they have no information from the Donggala area.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse,” he said.
The agency received a lot of criticism on Saturday, noting that the tsunami hit Palu, but officials say the waves came just at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on the upper floor is heard screaming to warn people on the street of an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collided with the shore and took buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The quake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities say the military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport was only open for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's really bad.
According to Mr. Doseba, members of the World Vision organization from Donggala arrived safely in Palo, where the workers set up a shelter in the courtyard in front of their premises, but on the way they saw many scenes of desolation.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that they did not allow foreign aid workers with extensive experience to come to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, supplies and personnel assistance are allowed only if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster area.
That's never happened before.
“It is still being treated as a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing cling to the hope that their nearest miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, with her mother’s body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has been training two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As an old man in the field of paragliding, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated around the paraglider community, in desperation, he sent WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray tick instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while charging ATMs in Newport on the Levee
According to Newport Police, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s security guard who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Lee’s downtown area on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “approached a Brink’s security officer from behind” and stole a bag of delivery money.
Witnesses reportedly saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not give an exact number of those involved.
Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects, please call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He posted the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, “Being with the official name Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for “personal reasons,” the show’s creator said.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when discussing the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you and I am all of us.
I changed Kanye, which means “the only one,” into Ye – it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
West’s former associate, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without a dash and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements began operating in Latin America, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people at peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans and provide monthly subsidies to students, and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education are dragging young people into criminal networks.
The U.S. should double its artificial intelligence funding.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds it spends on research in this field, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
In the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are well behind the U.S. and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major advance in artificial intelligence will happen in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is chairman of Sinovation Ventures, a China+ company that has invested in one of the world’s most influential companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranking American player in the game Othello, and later served as CEO at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
Lee said he was acquainted with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) robotics competition, and asked when it would be next to help him find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. must work hard if they are to receive government support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes on the best academics, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited the best from universities to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said changes to immigration policies could help the U.S. step up efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for a new generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, bringing together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrower artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in AI Next.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country’s name
Macedonian citizens voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but the boycott campaign expressed doubts that attendance would be at least 50 percent as long as it was necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by agreeing a deal with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote, which will be decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our city is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko submitted their ballot papers for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country’s name, which would pave the way to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents erected by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
“I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after handing over his ballot.
He added that a positive result would be “confirmation of our future”.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
A second poll conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma showed that 57% of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy, which took office last May.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City played Brighton's entire defense and scored
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
The Argentine striker took a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the campaign.
He ran between Brighton's three defensive players and found an open space.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green players.
He outplayed one defensive player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he handed Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in the penalty area, the English forward returned the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is having problems with his legs,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were fortunate to have scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who secured the Blues the initial lead in the Premier League duel.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's halves.
He handed the ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched the ball several times, then sent the ball to Sterling towards the distant gateway.
The blue-blue striker pushed the ball into the net just before it flew past the goal.
City will meet Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, in the Champions League group stage.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their chances for the title
The Nationals are out of the finals, so there's no reason to attack again.
But always competing Scherzer hopes to be able to climb the pitching hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday. This will only happen if the Rockies still have a chance to play in the finals, as in the Western League they have a match advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies secured at least an invitation from the organizers on Friday with a 5:2 win over the Nationals, but are still waiting for their first division title.
“Although we can’t win anything, at least we will be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a great crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will play at probably the highest level this year.
“Why don’t you want to compete?”
The Nationals have not released the name of the first pitcher for Sunday, but it is likely that in this case he will be throwing Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first to throw for the 34th time, threw on Thursday as a relief player and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
The Washington Right accumulated 18 wins and 7 losses this season with an average of 2.53 runs and 300 knockouts in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly touched on the situation regarding Brett Kavanaugh’s election to the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we did will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks until one of the most important elections in our lives.
“They’re going to be one of the biggest ones – I’m really trying to run, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
“We have this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, and it’s happening right now.
They are determined to take power again, using all possible means. You can see rudeness, malice.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to roam around to gain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control, but that’s not what we’re going to give them.”
Democrats are on a mission of “resisting and obstructing.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, mean, mean, and lying.”
He cited Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Judiciary Committee, and voiced loud disapproval from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait. That was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
She is impatient with those who express their opinion.
When a Momentum activist in my local party expressed his distrust of me, it was not even a surprise.
After all, I am the last in line of Labour Members of Parliament who are not welcome to express their opinion.
A similar thing happened to my colleague, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a motion of no confidence for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party said in a statement Friday that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In the eight years I've been a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday's meetings have mostly been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today most meetings do not use such a tone, and the promise of a “kinder and gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is increasingly apparent that different views within the Labour Party are not permissible, and each opinion assesses whether this is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues who I previously thought shared similar political views expected me to change my mind and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – be it in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is criticism on social media that calls for non-election, condemns the politics of the middle and tells me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are only political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most deplorable aspects of this period of policy is how abuse rates have become quite commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions, and with each proposal of mistrust or change of the rules for selection, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice to bow my head and not be so loud, and I’ll be “all right.”
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago — the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which caused the classroom in my elementary school to literally collapse — as a local councilor or government minister, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most.
I have never concealed my political beliefs, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political views and areas on which I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is sailing towards a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of non-election or political adequacy will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament from the Nottingham East party.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr to the top of the rankings
Two late attempts slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderfully fun championship game of the day.
They are now at the top of the rankings and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the scales were moved to the home page by their superior defense and better use of the opportunity, and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through a lot of tests in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to the Ayra team, they took advantage of the opportunity better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute goal, which was converted by Frazier Clima, led Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which he received in a game with the Warriors, meant a numerical lead for Melrose, and Jason Baggott intercepted an attempt without conversion.
Climo stepped up the lead for Ayr in the foul before scoring at halftime and then converted the stand-alone attempt to a 17–5 score for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt to convert him to Baggot reduced the lag to five points.
A long hiatus followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried away on a stretcher, and after the sequel Ayr advanced with an attempt by Stafford McDowall to turn him into Climo.
Interim captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose re-tapped the game with a player more by an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing Clima without the ball, MacPherson scored a goal in the attack.
Climo scored points after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent wingman Gregor Henry to the hosts' fifth attempt.
The star of the series Still Game starts a new career in the hospitality industry
Still Game series star Ford Kieran is apparently going into the catering business, as he is set to become the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to join a "flowering catering" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Navy blue flags are displayed on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with a slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody conflict over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive—as is the longing for a re-float of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is perhaps the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the international court's decision, which will be delivered on October 1 after five years of consultations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and impartiality, and of course, in a positive spirit, it expects a result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court’s decision on big screens across the country, hoping that a court in The Hague will rule in Bolivia’s favor, arguing that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile must negotiate Bolivia’s access to sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has high expectations for Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court will not rule in Bolivia’s favor —and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to allocate Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the international court’s decision comes just six months after hearing the final arguments means that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, they've not been talking in favor of Bolivia, but they're probably going to cost it a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has absorbed all the goodwill from the Chileans that may still be there, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court took a decision unusually quickly.
He said Monday would bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never relinquish its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“A decision is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on its promises made at a meeting between the leaders of rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which was at a deadlock, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said the U.S. is wrong if it thinks continued sanctions and opposition to an end to the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington has been cautious in upholding the announcement without Pyongyang first taking decisive disarmament measures.
US President Donald Trump and Kim want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up weapons, which the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
At fashion shows in Paris unveiled the latest line of huge headdresses coming to stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to complete your collection of headgear or completely hide from the sun, you do not need to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a collection of quirky oversized headdresses in their spring and summer 2019 collections on the catwalk, which dazzled the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
The Valentine's piece that stood out the most was a beige-colored hat with wide knickers decorated with feather-like accessories, in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons with precious stones, a witch hat, and even a pineapple – but they won’t keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have sutured lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter's mask than high fashion.
One creation was similar to scuba diving equipment with a breather and glasses, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion connoisseurs assume that huge headgear will come to the stores near you.
Wide hats closely follow "La Bomba", a straw hat with 60-centimeter-long spikes was spotted, among others, on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat that swept through social media sent another big creation down the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit model she wore.
The raffia bag in burnt orange, lined with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the central piece of Jacquemus’ La Riviera collection for spring/summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive in stores next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, the demand for oversized accessories would be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is crucial for global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy a reputation for academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam scores, further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and the city they have as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, the conversation is imprinted in his memory.
But if you talk to a person in his or her native language, the words are imprinted on his or her heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results of recent exams show that languages are at the top of the rankings with the highest success rates in independent schools.
68% of students who studied a foreign language achieved an excellent grade.
Data collected from 74 Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) member schools showed that 72% of pupils scored excellent in Mandarin, while 72% of German pupils, 69% of French pupils and 63% of Spanish pupils also scored excellent.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as an optional subject in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK’s Employment and Training Commission found that 17% of the reasons employers struggle to fill job vacancies can be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
For future job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in a global world.
If someone learns another language, whatever career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically has a competitive advantage.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to communicate, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, that is, 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for children today.
By knowing more languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are supposed to be most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, in independent schools it will always be possible to choose from a number of languages taught by specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must be expressed in education as well.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's going to be fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut in the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
For fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn’t know how many minutes he’ll play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies in his campaign today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five planned rallies next week, including stops in his-friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidacy for a vacant seat on the Supreme Court not yet confirmed, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress following the November vote.
What time will Trump’s rally be in West Virginia, and where can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. Eastern Time.
You can watch the Trump Convention in West Virginia live on the YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to talk about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearings this week, which have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, making Senate confirmation expected to be delayed by a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who face major elections in November, gain new momentum.
That’s why President Trump’s campaign for the five rallies was aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.
“Congress oversight is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the tough campaign season,” a Trump campaign official told Reuters.
Today’s rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract the interest of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month, where he scored more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican senator Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in opinion polls.
“It’s a bad sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come and lift him up in opinion polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team still has a desire to win and keeps hope ahead of Sunday’s singles matches
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon duels between two foursomes may have been what this year’s Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially at such competitions.
So where has the pendulum gone now?
“They had six points ahead and now they have four, so it’s probably a new momentum for us,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, as it leads by four points, and it can get twelve more.
But Americans, according to Spieth, feel that they have the wind in the sails, in addition, they were encouraged, among other things, by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was fateful from the kick-off to the green and sets a good example.
The cries of happiness continued to grow louder and led to a decisive blow when he and Thomas equalized in the fourth game after a two-point lag.
The punch that brought them victory at the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
Eighteen holes to fame.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The unusual but charming two of Europe have scored four points out of four and are unmistakable.
The Molliwood pair were the only ones not to hit the bug on Saturday afternoon, and they also avoided the bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way the energy is apparently flowing between them and the noisy audience confirm the fact that they are the players who will have to be beaten on Sunday, and no other player could better seal any European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Maybe both at the same time in different places.
But it would be premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the four-ball game, who was paired with Alex Noren.
Due to a bug and two double bugs on the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
Players will not be able to play on Saturday.
Four-ball games and duels between two pairs make it an interesting exception to watch closely because of the communication between couples, the tips they give each other, the tips they don’t give each other, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a big advantage over the last day, but the duels of two pairs showed that the US team has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is heading for the final day of the Ryder Cup with a nice lead after leading 10-6 against the United States after Saturday’s four-ball games and two-two-matches.
The exquisite pair, consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, did their best to score four points with two wins over Tiger Woods and at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which is seeking to win the trophy it lost at Hazeltin two years ago, had a four-ball victory over the American team that sinned in the morning games and led in a 3-1 draw.
The U.S. team resisted better in the duel of two pairs, where they won two games, but could not catch up.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari (the pair were dubbed "Molliwood") are only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then proved themselves again and more convincingly defeated the worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at times, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball duels and two-double duels, seven of which in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning four-ball games, returned for two doubles matches and, paired with Henrik Stenson, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopka, both ranked first and third in the world rankings by 2 and 1.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, everything did not go according to the plans of the team of Europe.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1, they decisively won against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned, defeating Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in duels of two, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team returned after a four-point gap before individual matches, although Fury's team only needs a tie to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: 'Without confidence, we will not disarm unilaterally'
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued implementation of sanctions is causing growing mistrust of the United States and that North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the body that North Korea had taken a number of "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, undermining a nuclear test site, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“We don’t see the right response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in national security, and under such conditions we will not unilaterally disarm first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea for adopting gradual measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the incumbent U.S. President and the North Korean leader, held on June 12 in Singapore. At the time, Kim pledged to strive for “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump promised North Korea Security assurances.
North Korea wants an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists that we must first disarm nuclear weapons, and it is escalating pressure with sanctions to coerce us into achieving our goals, and it is even opposing the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions could bring us to our knees is the unrealistic hope of people who don’t know us at all.
The problem, however, is that the continued implementation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which the US president outlined at the United Nations Assembly earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the problem of nuclear disarmament were discussed with South Korea rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have landed at such a dead end.”
However, the tone of Mr. Ri’s speech was completely different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack on the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim “a missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said he still had a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timetable for this, saying, “It could be two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue resolutely and without exception until we recognize a complete, final and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions against North Korea to prevent funding for North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, and a few hours later North Korea criticized him, saying his demands were “gangsteric.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to demolish a missile test station and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States takes "appropriate action".
Kim said the “appropriate measures” meant the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course to learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight against the growing macho culture of “all-night” learning, in which the forces are accumulated with caffeine.
The university professor found that the students of the world’s best university often do not know the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, designed the course, which is the first of its kind in the United States.
To carry out such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to him and said, “Why do I only find out now that I’m in my senior year?”
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that he was surprised.
The course, which is being conducted for the first time this year, speaks about the key importance of good sleep habits for academic and sports success, as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says they chose such a course when they found that students significantly lacked sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dorm door where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports slippers, and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on athletic success, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We are aware that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know these facts, just as they have a right to know how cigarette smoking affects their health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present with “survived night-long learning” and adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, resulting in lack of sleep, are growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, they can also avoid weight gain – the brain, due to lack of sleep, goes into the mode of hunger, which makes students constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended one of the professor's lectures.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes to be able to ask postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme in the next phase before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm clock for sleeping as well as waking up. He also wants to alert them to the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, as they can cause an imbalance in the circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit sank the ups of Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated away: Dolly Meng in Livingston proclaimed Steven Gerrard's team condemned to defeat by 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team chased their first away win since February's victory at St. Johnstone Stadium by 4–1, but Gary Holt's team has conceded her second defeat in 18 games since leading Gerrard's team, lagging his team behind for the Scottish League lead team by 8 points.
Meng was attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the selected line of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
With this, the Rangers fell to a frequent place, and Livingston advanced to third place, but with a goal difference behind the team Hibernian
Calum Spence, a side referee, suffered a head injury when an object was reported to have flown into him from the fan site of the away team.
Gerrard made eight shifts in the team, which easily defeated Ayr and qualified for the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt stuck to the verified 11 of Livingston, who had stripped the Hearts of a point a week earlier, and was undoubtedly impressed by how his leaning team effectively neutralized any guest attempts.
The Rangers had higher possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came two minutes after the start, when Meng found Scott Pittman with the first short pass, who then set off for the goal of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder was inaccurate in his performance and missed the opportunity.
A long free-kick by Keagan Jacobs then scored Captain Craig Halkett, but the ball then his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after a collision with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the match, a penalty shot should have been awarded, but referee Steven Thomson crushed the Colombian's demands in the bud.
The Rangers managed to put together only two shots per goal in the first half, but neither Lassana Coulibaly's head shot nor Ovie Ejari's swinging ball posed any danger to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but his persistence made him well-deserved.
The Rangers failed to cash in another Jacobs long pass.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher got the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi's pass for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard acted and replaced Coulibaly with wingman Ryan Kent during the break, who immediately proved himself with a pass to Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of more passes before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead further towards the end of the match, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, then Lithgow was inaccurate after serving from the corner.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a penalty shot at the end of the game after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not recognize him.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
We present a page from the almanac of our Sunday editions: on September 30, 1882, more than 136 years ago today, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who later became a world-renowned physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
He became a regular in the scientific world, and also gained his place in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
The man said, “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter, used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect that radioactivity in materials has on atoms.”
Evans: "Holy shit, they're really talking now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
An invention with his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to Recognize Attacking Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize invading cells and destroy them
Vaccine as part of therapy teaches the immune system to recognize attacking cells
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells, which are then modified in the laboratory
After that, they can “see” the protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize attacking cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several different cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells from patients who are “teached” to target cancer cells also worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West performed a pro-Trump point with the inscription MAGA on the stroke.
The audience was not impressed.
Kanye West was whistled at the Saturday Night Live studio after a freak show during which he expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump and also said he would be running for president in 2020.
At the end of the performance with the third song of his performance, called "Ghost Town", during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great Again", West began to attack the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white person and he says, ‘How can you like Trump when he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” he says.
This year’s SNL show began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood actor mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
The recording of West's monologue was not broadcast, but was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock intended to make fun of West with this.
West complained to the audience, among other things, that he had some problems in the background due to the inscription on the stroke.
“They attacked me on stage.
I was told ‘don’t go on stage with this hat.’
They harassed me!
They say I’m lost,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that he had to put on a “Superman cape because it means no one can command me. You want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments made the audience whistle at least twice, and members of the SNL team were obviously embarrassed, but someone told Vanity: "There was a deadly silence in the studio."
West was invited at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was astonished by the video for the song "I Love It", where he wore a bottle of Perrier mineral water costume.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted, "One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING TO PARADISE."
The talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “what it is, and that’s perfectly fine.
However, I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
“We too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would henceforth be "a creature formally known as Kanye West. I am now YE."
Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy, was the first musician to change his name.
His station colleague Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion, but we can not forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then the Artist, once known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbing at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington speaks out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-shaking role as Jon Snow in HBO’s exciting medieval-colored fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, who has sharply condemned the stereotype of a macho hero, says that because of the appearance of such roles on screens, young boys often feel that they can only earn respect by perseverance.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that he thought something went wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of the #JazTudi movement.
The actor, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, admitted he has strong beliefs about the subject.
“Personally, I’m seriously wondering where we made a mistake when it comes to masculinity,” he said.
“What did we teach men when we were growing up about the problems we face now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what has been learned?
What are we taught on TV and on the streets that young boys feel they have to choose this particular side of masculinity?
I think one of the important questions of our time is, how can we change this?
“Something went wrong with the boys.”
In an interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer, he will not participate in the filming of any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones, because he "concluded with battlefields and horses".
In November, Kit will star in a new production of True West by Sam Shepard, a film about a producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose on set.
“It’s because of this series that I met my wife, so in a way, she gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual intercourse, representing a change from the past.
Typically, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials from a conference in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero.
Yet the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 per year.
Transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a very pressing problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very prevalent.
Because conservative values still apply in the country, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual intercourse in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of efforts to address the problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff released data on Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her staff posted information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A Los Angeles-based Democrat said the allegations came from individuals and far-right websites.
“Lies, lies, and more unacceptable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The data was released Thursday by an unidentified person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against supreme court nominee Brett Kanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators concluded Kavanaugh's interrogation.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that an IP address can identify a source of publication that is supposed to be linked to Senator Waters’ office and conclude that the information was posted by someone from staff, Hill reports.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false and a sheer lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by these false accusations, are in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely untrue and a sheer lie.”
The statement by Senator Waters quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press spokesman Ari Fleischer.
“From this denial a branch of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This may mean that it’s not from the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not question the motive of the person who accused him.
He must remain calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's democratic criticism, who was accused of being too obviously angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee running for Waters in the midterm elections, tweeted.
“If that’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Ms Waters said her cabinet had “informed the relevant institutions and law enforcement authorities regarding these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English as Rowan Atkinson as Undercover Agent
The search for hints of Brexit in any new British film has become a tradition, and it is also true for the revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which first came to the screen in 2003 under the title Johnny English and the sequel in 2011 under the title Johnny English 2.
Will a fun satire about how sucky we are be a new export opportunity for us?
The incompetent Johnny English with puffy eyes and unusual grimaces gets permission to mix the strings again; already his name suggests that he is a comic character created for a cinematic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
He is an awkward undercover agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a piece of Clouseau, a snippet of Mr. Bean, and a snippet of the one who contributed the final note to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, leaving behind a real mess.
The latest film presents one or two pleasant moments.
I loved it when Johnny English was approaching in a helicopter, wearing medieval armor, and the rotor leaves touched his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems a bit mild and excessively unnecessary, especially since "serious" films like 007 or Mission Impossible now offer comic elements without a bad conscience.
It seems as if humor is meant for children and not so much adult viewers, which is why Johnny English's reflections are not as innovative and focused for me as Atkinson's silent sketches as Mr. Bean.
It is now clear that the UK is in serious trouble.
A web hacker has infiltrated Britain’s most undercover agent network and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing major trouble to a competent agent, represented in a surprisingly small role by Kevin Eldon.
This is a turning point for the prime minister, a pompous figure who has already suffered a breakdown due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has made an effort to play the alleged Theresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script that she can help herself with.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies have been exposed, so she must choose one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a respected school, who unofficially teaches how to work undercover: here the screenwriters hit, because English runs a kind of espionage “rock academy”.
English is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets longtime co-worker Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotypical sports fan, in a role in which Vicki Pepperdine gets a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create even more trouble on behalf of Her Majesty's Secret Service, while meeting fatalist Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak onto the deck of Walt's yacht, and when English tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with the interior of Walt's house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and vigor it resembles a children's film.
Very average.
As with other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder: is a British film capable of giving Atkinson a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labour denies that they plan a four-day work week for Britons, and that they would be paid for a five-day work week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week and receive a five-day paycheck.
The client of business leaders wants the savings created by companies as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution to spill over to workers and give them an extra day off.
This way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high salary.
Sources say that the idea corresponds to the party’s economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of the workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day work week, as it is a way for workers to reap the benefits of a changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but the four-week workweek is a goal that we will strive to achieve with the customer’s approach to balancing the economy to the benefit of the worker and the customer’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported a four-week working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At present, the Labour Party as a whole does not support this goal.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party does not think about it.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour conference last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to tear the power out of “reckless CEOs” and “winners” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current stakeholders in plumbing companies may not regain their full stake, as the Labour party could introduce “deductions” on the basis of alleged injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on the boards of directors and to introduce equity funds, thereby transferring a 10% stake in private companies to employees, which would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the findings of the office of any Republican senator could convince the judge to withhold his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, a correspondent for 60 Minutes asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him, when this accusation came up, I asked him, ‘Did you do this?’”
He was determined, unwavering, unambiguous.”
But Graham's voice seems to be carved into the rock.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would need a very convincing reason to change him,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of those who were named by her could confirm this.
The case is 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed in any way to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event that features a truly extraordinary line of stars and has the same extraordinary mission: to end poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands of people will take part in the festival for the seventh time. They will occupy the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the true purpose of the event, i.e. the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizens Festival is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert participants had to complete a series of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, a letter to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another example of so-called “clicism” – creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or tweeting?
The Global Citizen movement says it has recorded more than 19 million “acts” by its supporters since 2011 in pursuit of a range of different goals.
He says these actions have helped world leaders make commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group said its actions were the result of 390 commitments and messages that had already paid or raised at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to “helping children realize their full potential,” who pledged $35 million in aid to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens Movement.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition into historical archives,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Partnership, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the government, after taking more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, announced that it would co-finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutritional measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizen movement responded: “It’s going to be a long and hard road – sometimes we’re going to fall and we’re going to fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid ahead, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers who will perform at this year’s event in New York. The event will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy to ‘Block’ Russian Energy Exports
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said the U.S. could use the navy to prevent Russian energy marketing, including in the Middle East, “if necessary.”
Zinke said Russia’s intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, however, there are ways and means to cope with this.
“The United States can do this, the Navy makes sure that our sea routes are open and block them if necessary, thereby preventing Russian energy products from flowing into the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group that is referred to as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it was essentially the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic possibility is more or less to influence fuels and replace them,” he said, calling Russia “a pony who knows one trick,” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is seeking to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is supposed to displace Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin a “hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that this is unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we share the same view that energy should not be a tool for putting pressure on consumers and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Interfering with a third country in our energy supply is a big problem for me,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Association (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "examine" her candidacy for 2020 U.S. presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “examine” her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
At a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider my candidacy for president.”
Warren rebuked President Donald Trump at a town hall meeting, saying he was “guiding this country in the wrong direction.”
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy is of great concern to me,” she said.
Warren has repeatedly criticized Trump and Supreme Court presidential nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election.”
But a poll released on Thursday found that most of her own voters felt Warren shouldn’t be running for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Political Research Center/Boston Globe newspaper, the senator should not run for president, with 58 percent of Massachusetts’s “probable” voters.
Thirty-two percent would support his candidacy.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick had more support for the candidacy, with 38 percent of respondents supporting it and 48 percent opposing it.
Other top Democrats who would be eligible to run in the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press, said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin at a rally in support of Donald Trump mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder of Tracko Palin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through on his return, connects me to other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and the degree of woundedness that our soldiers are returning to,” he told audiences at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son’s arrest “an elephant in the saloon” and said her son and other war veterans were returning slightly changed, hardened, wondering where the respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators and all other members of the military had donated to the state was.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and possession of a weapon in a drunken state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla police.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support rejection of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal crackdown on a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence the right to asylum.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the district filled the court lobby on Friday to support a legal crackdown on the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal politics was not disclosed.
She said her partner and “his violent gang sons” had abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Federal prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications come to the United States, as countries that constantly face problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, a new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision by the Immigrant Appeals Committee that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to file an asylum application.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “despises decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court said.
Prosecutors also said in the request that policies that deny immigrants the right of entry are damaging to the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy post.
Asylum was never meant to eliminate all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue efforts are underway to find survivors
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“It feels very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her feverish boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Rescuers are constantly bringing in bodies.
“There is a lack of clean water.”
It looked like the townspeople, returning to the ruined homes, breaking through the wet things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude quake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a back and shoulder injury, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to the constant strong aftershocks.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that rocked the hotel room on the fifth floor in which he was staying with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to save.
I think it squeezed me against the ruins of the walls,” Harris told the Associated Press. He added that he was in the city with his family for the wedding.
“I heard a woman screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Harassment' With 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after a four-page ad in an official Chinese newspaper praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Sunday mentioned a paid allowance for the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, which China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials described Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. federal election as a new phase in Washington’s increasingly intense effort to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place trade promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an intensifying trade war in which they exchange blows by imposing tariffs on imported products.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of a trade war are expected to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, "now duplicates this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government used the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see very few other opinions on the newspaper stands in Beijing, and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic path, as the media is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected an offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans lose voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the most important Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming midterm elections with the loss of voters.
Emotions are extremely high here, and a majority of Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
It can’t be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell’s University of Syracuse, for an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that pressure from Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, and they won’t forget it tomorrow, and they won’t forget it in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic news portal reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will go beyond all boundaries,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told reporters.
“People say they’re already strong, and that’s true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among unspecified voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who don’t like the president, but don’t vote often.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her accusations of sexually assaulting a Supreme Court nominee, analysts said further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Council, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the council vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh’s oath; it’s also about the way Republicans deal with it and the way they treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic-backed US Priorities Group, told the TV channel.
Americans, on the other hand, seem somewhat divided on whether to believe Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a bit more support for the latter.
A new YouGov survey found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony most or certainly, and 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh most or certainly.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or certain to have lied during the testimony, compared to only 30 percent who said so about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBA is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Council under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her intoxicated when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court showed her sex while they were together at a party, during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to start a new Internet to fight with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners’ open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to “dominate the world.”
“We decided to do it now,” he said of the new company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses the Solid platform technology, which allows users to create a "personal data storage" or POD
This can include contact information, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The peculiarity of the personal data storage facility is that the user can fully determine who can access what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment with data”.
CEO John Bruce says the company’s idea is to bring together the resources, processes, and relevant skills that will enable access to the Solid platform for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and the group “are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether they could introduce a complete change that could end all their business models overnight.”
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote on Medium on Saturday that Inrupt’s goal is to “provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Feast of the Victoria Cross of World War I
In their hometown, they have been celebrating the awarding of the Victoria Cross to the only priest of the Church of England who won it as a fighter in the First World War for 100 years.
The Venerable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was honored on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was shot by a sniper, so he never learned that he had been awarded this highest British military honor.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the colonel’s grandchildren discovered a memorial stone.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s action to earn him a medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint Quintin Canal "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire of the battlefield and machine guns."
Later, he rushed towards the firing line and with the "greatest heroism" led the line forward, then attacked the machine gun himself and hit three members of the squadron.
On 4 October 2018, just a good month before the end of the war, Lt. Col. Vann was shot by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know and could never achieve, so he teaches me humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, lay a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Vann said he felt "very honored to be part of this parade" and "that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that will be expressed by many people."
Enthusiasts of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206.
Imagine: You’ve been up all night watching a completely sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can’t see the main event.
The San Jose event included 13 fights, including six on the main floor, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked to learn that the show had been replaced by a playback of Pig Pep.
Many were not very enthusiastic, as he stayed awake until the morning due to the duel.
One Twitter fan described the switch to a children’s cartoon as “some kind of sick joke.”
“According to a government decree, this content is not appropriate at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
"Pig Peppa. Yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could sort it out,” Coker said.
“But then it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged during the switching and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix the issue; we assumed it was just a technical error.
However, the real reason was a government decree.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will endure five fights – as usual. We tried to offer fans more than expected and we saved ourselves.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “inferior” about sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he felt inferior to anyone because of his sexual orientation — but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he realized that “not everyone is like” himself when he entered high school.
Speaking on the first show, Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics decreased.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, was absent due to months of illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less worthy" than everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and differentiation are the real thing that gives me the strength and perseverance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his orientation.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an influential advocate of LGBT rights and has appeared twice at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy to be able to speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" by the romance with the man -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but says the age difference never meant a problem.
“When you’re so young,” he said — at the age of 14, he attended the first Olympic Games and three years later his father died — it’s hard to find someone of the same age who would have experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted a child in June, son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says this changed his "whole look".
“If you asked me last year, all I’d have to say is ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
The son bears the same name as Daley’s father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked was if he already had tickets to London 2012 as he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn’t tell him, “You’re not going to be in the front row this time, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally had to admit that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a home audience in the Olympics. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first selection of songs – Proud by musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in the preparations for the Olympic Games and still gives him a chill.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15am (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson sits down Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to get back in shape again so that it does not become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will take part in the biennial event for the 12th time, was allowed to sit by Captain Furyk at Saturday's four.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he was so often for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly improving his game to fix what weighed him down.
Given that even at the height of his career he did not measure the most straight, the 48-year-old does not best fit the narrow course of Le Golf National, where the long ice inevitably punishes missed blows.
And if the pitch wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will have to deal with the exact winner of the British Open Cup in Sunday’s ninth game, Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who have four games less at the start of the 12 games of the individual, had a good start, Mickelson’s match could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but otherwise he did not say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, spanked my back and hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the celebrities and has made a great contribution to the teams in the past and this week as well.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I imagined more, but it worked out that way, and we thought that was the way to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Ryder Cup career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his presence on the team also brings some intangible benefits.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to make fun of people and it’s great to have him in a team space,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun fighting him this week, which was fun to see.”
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows he could take a big advantage soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The young Dane made his debut in 1997 at a game in Valderrama, where the side captained by Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but made it through the goal with an advantage of only a haircut, with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“Remember we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost and in Valderrama where we won but barely,” Bjorn (pictured) said after seeing the team win Class of 2018 by 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and leading the field at Le Golf National with a lead of 10-6.
History shows me and everyone in the team that the Cup is not over yet.
Play it full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
The game isn't over until it's on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
He has always said that I am focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Excited about his players playing on a demanding pitch, Bjorn added: “I would never be in a hurry here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow will be the game of individuals, so it will have to be dealt with differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, your golf skills are tested to the end.
This is the message you have to convey to the players: tomorrow you have to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind, and he too must get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the turnarounds in the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the “Miracle in Medina.”
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, led his players on the last day of the game.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When this momentum gains perseverance, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We created the right layout and put the guys in a way that made us feel like we were going to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the battle and fight Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the top half of the row.
“With this group of guys, I chose this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Bjorn said of the selection of individuals.
New German warship decommissioned
The latest frigate of the German navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but due to system failures and rapidly rising costs, it will not be until at least next year, local media reported.
The surrender of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new class frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The vessel is due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is plagued by worrying post-delivery issues.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigate.
They are expected to have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealment technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – the latest frigates are expected to remain outside the home port for up to two years.
The constant delays mean that the top-of-the-line warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to influence overseas with their power, will become obsolete by the time they are put into service, the newspaper Die Ziet notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, and the German media cited a number of key "programming and technical flaws" that would render the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software shortcomings were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is considerably overweight, which reduces its capacity and limits the Navy's options for its future upgrade.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz ship was said to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – became a problem.
This is expected to reach a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, admitted that the navy was in fact “out of ships suitable for deployment.”
The official said the issue became more acute over time because the old ships were decommissioned and replacement vessels were not provided.
He regretted that no ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Fund eavesdrop on the secret life of bats
A new study is being conducted on a property in the Highlands of Scotland to discover how bats use food to hunt for food.
They hope the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Endowment for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and small bats, as well as brown eared bats and bypass bats at the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
Special recorders will be installed at key sites of the estate to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of bat calls and what kind of things they do.
They will then draw up a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior across the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s conservation advisor, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are best suited for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as flycatchers and certain types of chemical treatment of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks, are also at risk.
Bats are not blind.
Because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they help themselves more with their ears than their eyes when hunting prey.
To accurately determine the errors and obstacles on the flight path, they use a sophisticated echolocation technique.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, shelter inspections and occasional rescues.
The organization has even established the first and for now the only Scottish reserve specifically dedicated to bats on the Threave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“We have a great area for bats on Thread,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and all the quality habitat.
But there is still much to know about bats, and the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on the estates, since the possible accidental destruction of a single bat nursery can lead to the death of up to 400 females and cubs, which can mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity hospitals.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we simply don’t know how well they hold their populations.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, lawyers prepare for German magazine lawsuit
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people wanted to “promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing for a lawsuit by the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
When addressing 142 million followers on Instagram Live video several hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I’m a happy man and I wish everyone well,” the actor added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on charges they called “unacceptable reporting of suspicions about private life.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “non-pecuniary damage in an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, she was reported to have returned to the player's room after meeting with Ronaldo at Mayorga's nightclub, where he reportedly raped her anally.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was “99 percent a good man” who disappointed only in “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the sexual intercourse, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she referred to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terribly afraid of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old claims she wants to cancel the settlement because she continues to suffer severe trauma as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before moving from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, under a $100 million deal, he moved to Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' loss of carmakers
The UK “would regret forever” losing its status as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt production at a plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concerns about how a no-deal exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “right time” basis, with parts from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars arriving every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could cause disruptions at the borders, which industry officials say could cause congestion and lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to store parts for more than a day at its plant in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU “is precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.”
“We need to reach a deal. We want to reach the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers’ data is that we absolutely need to be able to continue our highly successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not comment on how long production would have stopped, but in the long run it warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of Unite at the factory, said his members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, a job lost is never recovered.”
The government spokesperson said: “We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for another week” due to the ongoing battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who examines Russian election meddling, links between Trump’s associates and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will fire the Attorney General’s envoy, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a wiretapping device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House amid reports that he was planning to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was declared Thursday.
Trump said he “would rather not” fire Rosenstein, and the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date has not yet been set for him. It could happen this week, and given everything else going on in the Supreme Court, it could be postponed for another week.
We’ll see. I always like to keep you informed.”
Sanders hasn't called a White House press meeting since Sept. 10.
Chris Wallace, the show's host, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of meetings could not be attributed to the resistance to "setting up" TV reporters, but she said: "I couldn't deny that they were setting up."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding, without mentioning the source, “We looked at the numbers.”
But if journalists can address the President of the United States directly with their question, it is infinitely better than discussing it with me.
We are trying to make this possible, and you have seen that we have done this often over the past few weeks and that you will have a conference at which you can speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared in front of the assembled journalists in an open-minded and partially bizarre way.
Letter from the Minister of Health to EU workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit-related concerns
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire to continue the work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to paying the cost of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal resumed, with decisions approaching this autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and non-EU countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit patients and the communities we care for.
You can feel completely at home in Scotland, and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie has been operated on after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of The Tennessean.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury happened just before halftime.
“He got to the edge of the playground and he kind of collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the court before placing him on a stretcher and taking him off the court for further examination.
A Tennessee State University official told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "details about the type/size of the injury are not yet known" and that Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a freshman at the university, is playing for Tennessee State University for the first time since moving from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered a total of five strokes before leaving the game, bringing his total number of strokes in the season to 18 strokes.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to help the homeless under the new plans of the Tories.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and the money raised will go to the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and greater taxation for high-income people.
The increased stamp duty will be charged to people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, and the extra money will spur the government’s efforts to end homelessness.
The surcharge – which will be charged in addition to the current stamp duty, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and broadcasting properties – could be no less than three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by imposing the measure.
It is estimated that non-UK citizens will buy 13% of London’s newly built properties, resulting in higher prices and a heavier purchase of the first property.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially the capital – have become “ghost towns” as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the cost of housing to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of raising prices by snatching land they don’t actually use, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas for affordable housing in order to repair Britain’s “housing disgrace.”
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rents and the end of forced evictions without errors.
In addition, it wants to give city councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year, I said that I would dedicate my premiere leadership to renewing the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
This also means fixing our dysfunctional housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign businesses, buying homes is as easy as for garbage British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland's chief executive, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate goal" is to one day become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of reviving North-East, currently ranked third in the Premier League, with three points less than first place.
He moved to Light Stadium this summer after St Mirren took the Scottish Championships again in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I got a B cap and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland as a child in Hampden, so it was always something that drew me back.
This opportunity would only come to me if I was successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former team boss Alloa Athletic, who had previously rejected bids from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, said he felt no fear as the successor to such great names.
“For me, success is measured by the question ‘Can I take this club back to the Premier League?’”
In terms of structure and capacity, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy road to get there, but I would probably consider it a success only if I could take the club there again.”
Ross has been a manager for only three years, after being assistant manager at Dumbarton and part of the Hearts coaching staff for 15 months.
Alloi then helped prevent relegation to the third league, and St Mirren led from the margin of relegation to the championship title next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“That was probably the real turning point,” Alloe recalled taking over.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds ridiculous because I was doing well as an actor, I was making a relatively good living and I also achieved some bigger successes.
But the game can be challenging.
There are a lot of things to face every week.
I’m still dealing with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but I just feel management is the right thing for me.
I’ve always wanted to run a club, and I’m doing it now, and I’m the most comfortable person I’ve ever been in my entire adult life.”

The ideal time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heat has boosted the revenues of hard-hitting British pubs, but there has also been increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business advisor who compiled the data, said: “The sustained sunny weather and England’s participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern to June in the previous month, when pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, only the power of restaurants was still low.
The drop in restaurant turnover by 1.8 percent in June increased further in July.
In comparison, turnover in pubs and bars with drinks increased more as turnover in restaurants decreased.
Due to the sunny weather, sales in pubs, which mainly offer food, also decreased, but not as dramatically as those of restaurant operators.
It seems that people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in one month, and food sales decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s group of leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue a trend we’ve seen since late April.
In the catering market, the biggest factors remain the weather and the impact of large social or sporting events.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the fall of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a more inopportune time for food shop owners, and only time will tell whether the necessary recovery will be brought by the milder temperatures we experienced in August.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7 percent in July, indicating slower brand adoption.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a measure of sales in the pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 business groups with total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an established industry reference.

Twenty Percent of Students Say They Have a “Main” Account Dedicated to Parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create an account on social media to hide it from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a rapid rise in fake Instagram accounts.
The news reinforced fears about the publication of sex-related content.
Twenty percent of high school students said they manage a censored “main” account that they show their parents, as well as having private accounts.

A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Principals (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom admit to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers succumb to the temptation to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” to the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Board of Athletics as non-executive director of the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete on the field and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who direct the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from her inclusion on the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I’m thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help run the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who out of a total of four Olympic medals won the 200-meter and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was left speechless after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be able to recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
An ad for a breast pump comparing mothers to cows has divided online opinions
A company that produces breast pumps has divided opinions with an ad comparing mothers to cows when milking.
To launch the marketing of the “first silent portable breast pump,” consumer tech company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad that is supposed to show mothers all the freedom that the gadget allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a barn filled with hay to a song that includes the following lyrics: “Yes, I’m pumping, but I don’t see any tails,” and “In case you haven’t noticed, these aren’t my nipples, these are my boobs.”
The choir continues: “Exhaust, exhaust, feed the babies, exhaust, exhaust, squeeze the breasts.”
But the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook website, caused considerable resentment on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it was a joke at the expense of the dairy industry’s “horror.”
“Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
“Like me, they get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen in the first few days after birth,” she wrote.

Another commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both the mother and the cub.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “The ad is completely unfeeling.”
Others praised the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "to die for funny".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it too if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I understood it the way it was meant to be.
“It’s a great product,” another wrote.
Someone commented: “This is a ridiculous ad that targets moms who run out of milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they danced with hidden pumps in their bra.
The concept of action is that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move, hold the baby and even do outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mothers, went on to comment, “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
By drawing a parallel between milk-pumping women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the focus of attention on milk-pumping and all its challenges, while in a fun way that women can connect with, to show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two took a walk on the modeling track for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of detainees of migrant children has risen sharply, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand over children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are undocumented migrants, so they fear that applying for a child would jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would be required to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large part of these are punished foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the treatment of children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, shelter workers said.
Many will show up by videoconferencing, not in person, to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those deemed not eligible will be expelled swiftly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to statements from shelter workers and reports that have arisen in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Advocates said these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornilla, where signs of a child’s distress are more likely to go unnoticed due to their size.
They added that moving children to the city of tents without emotionally preparing them or giving them a chance to say goodbye from friends could complicate the trauma many of them face.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would “treat them accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terrorism” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee their homes, was “almost over”.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have cleared Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for them to return, and blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading unreasonable fears” that persuaded refugees to stay abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
“They are turning it into a political issue, which should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive rebuilding funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last important rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity to resume political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that the military intervention will be directed against jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda, who “will be eradicated”.
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee soon, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the Syrian government's conditions for participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against meddling.
Why Trump is going to get a second term
Following this inference, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency ends prematurely with interpellation and scandal.
What would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!”
There are no signs of fatigue for the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million during peak viewing times, and MSNBC’s viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers at its peak, more than Nielsen said four years ago, when it had 1.7 million viewers, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" reached its highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on the night of important news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the host of the drama “Designated Survivors,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the acclaimed whistleblower of comedies and authors of “Only Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths About Snooping at the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different explanation.
Think of a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, the Washington story could decide the future of the Roe v. Wade case depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, watching a six-hour roundtable of experts discussing the use of a “deep-backed” source for Bob Woodward’s book Fear, a $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a thickly lined garment with puffiness,” The Washington Post said) and the aftermath of the shocking descriptions of Trump’s, kh khmya
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same again.
“Part of what he’s doing that gives the impression of a reality show is to offer something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars about the cast of Trump’s show and the daily spin-offs of the script (a duel with N.F.L., praised by Kim Jong Un).

When I was talking to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny 80 degrees (26.7 degrees C) outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was swollen inside while watching MSNBC when he was filming CNN.
There was no way he could break away, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the air.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in preparation for the closest midterm parliamentary elections
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district has seen a flood of money, with two candidates running for the same seat due to the reorganization of congressional districts.
Pittsburgh’s newly divided suburb is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election this spring in another district.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally drawn in favor of the Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th district touched on the struggle for campaign funding between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely watched March special election for the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. has been considering sanctions against El Salvador for its support of China.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization’s leadership.
Foreign ministry officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission leaders in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decision to end recognition of Taiwan,” ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
Sanctions were being considered on El Salvador, which is estimated to receive $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including anti-narcotics aid, development aid and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial assistance and targeted restrictions on visas, would severely affect this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, top government officials had explained they wanted the conference to continue, ending considerations on penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing attendees of the conference now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the U.S. government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hardline messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about them on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judiciary, about which there is now a lot of evidence in the public records.
Mr Mueller is also alleged to have directed the investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the attack on the U.S. election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to the authorities, and perhaps even to the jury of his colleagues, just as he prepares to address his constituents again.
There are a lot of questions in this, and I do not want to say that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable, and neither are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight can take.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West rebelled against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We did not succeed, thus missing the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
At such turning points, the course of history is changing and the implacable march of democracy is being accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are facing many of these challenges right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that it suggested secretly filming the president last year and speculated about his inadequacy for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will demand Mr. Trump's accountability?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she told me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
How can we not be so optimistic about our future?”

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with it being clear that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a convincing position for qualifying from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing before a 2–2 draw against Villarreal for the first time in the season, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard for greater achievements.
“It was a well-deserved point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We came into the game with the belief that we could achieve something and take a point.
You might be able to win in the end, but in general, a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we showed up and we were better in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they scored a good result in the last game, but I am confident with the crowd behind us that we can do our best to achieve a positive result.
“The last year has undoubtedly been difficult, given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes at the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place right now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.”
Women sleep poorly because of fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people talk about it with their family members.
Half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t bother to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start in the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare a family to take care of you if you don’t talk to them about it in a timely manner.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in the cost estimate.
Involve a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the transition.
Choose a health representative by designating a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure that the professionals take into account your health preferences if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider authorizing a person for their finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills will be paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this information down in your action plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about your finances. Do you know doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
I have this plan ready.”
In Ilfracomb, a man was shot several times with an air rifle.
A man returning home at night was repeatedly shot with an air rifle.
The shooter, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was repeatedly shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m., as a "random act".
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening, but police called in potential witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
With communications cut off, rescuers from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude quake, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some key information about Palu and Donggala in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province that lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and is estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a landscape that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi are aquaculture and agriculture, especially in the central region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but most of it takes place in Moravia, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggalo have been hit repeatedly by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Natural Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit northern Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the earthquake-active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes occur regularly here.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian estimate, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that flooded its southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height, destroying dozens of villages and causing the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Jay’s regency in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not trigger, but the buildings that fell caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused the death of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency said on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin’s acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, took the phone from her hands.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su Pre-Casual Institution and is in custody under an unsecured $500 guarantee, the KTUU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded “certainly innocent” when asked about his defense, the network reported.
Palin was charged with three Class A offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with one class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with reporting domestic violence, and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
When a tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people held a beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented delivery truck to carry out an attack on a cycling lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan when he ran over several pedestrians and a cyclist in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice on the death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the cause of the death penalty can be any of the charges.
Weeks after the attack, Saipo’s grand jury was briefed on a 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of assisted blackmail, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and intent,” prosecutors said, describing Saip’s behavior as “disgraceful, cruel and perverted.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Paganucco" in the novels on Alejandro Damián Paganuczo.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District Court handed down the last death penalty 10 years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers and finally turned his sentence into life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last handed down in New York City in a federal case in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
After the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
Police also said he demanded the display of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
On 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "apparently disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea in exchange for a life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events,” Patton said.
Saip’s defense group had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks, says Tory MEP
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” at a Tory conference.
A former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics when one of May’s own MPs suggested she should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK “would be out now” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in coordinating her deeply divided species has been highlighted by Tories, who are in favour of rejecting Brexit and who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is seeking to keep her plan on track in the midst of attacks by Brexit advocates, opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that May would try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and a "caos".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull to “get rid of Chequers.”
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as our interlocutor and give him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
This Wellingborough MEP added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: “We did not fight in world wars to be servants now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexiteer, also attended the meeting and told the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are active in the streets and even lead us to elections.
Please quit Chequers and start listening.’”
In a message addressed to Ms. Maye, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should be given a “feel of heat” if they intend to issue a decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’”
In a message to enthusiastic crowds, he added: “I want to make our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit betrayal, feel the heat.”
“We are mobilizing this country’s people’s army, which has secured us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, the remainers marched through Birmingham, where they then held a two-hour assembly in the city center.
A handful of activists have waved Tory flags against Brexit since the group was formed this weekend.
Labour nobleman Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security issues in using the party's app after the conference opened.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the border without delay, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren says possible presidential bid will be 'examined in detail'
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “take a close look at the race for the presidency” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
She is at the center of speculation that she could deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which demands a woman at the top.”
Arrest after LSU Sims's death in a shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of Friday’s shooting and asked for help identifying the person in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the interrogation that he was at the scene, that he had a gun, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starters in the last season, averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton was approaching the World Cup title, and the team ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettl
On Saturday, the moment Valtteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong influence on the race".
Bottas started well at the start and almost left Hamilton on the dry as he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettl to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to drive into the box and let Hamilton drive on the tail of the traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes drove into the pits later and left him behind Vettl, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that the Ferrari driver's reluctance left the inside open and risked falling behind after two defensive moves in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last row of the net and was in seventh place by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then drove most of the game without a tyre change, as he intended to make a quick finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and taking fourth place.
He finally got into boxing in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri drove fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman when he left me behind.
The team has done a really great job to reach first and second place,” Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence on not revealing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch on Ford’s testimony before a Senate committee of inquiry, but instead said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil, corrupt and lying.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days is that we can see the anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,” he said.
“When you look at posts and disclosures and people say, ‘No, I didn’t do it.’”
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... you uncovered a document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
Okay, hold on a second.
We have revealed it to us... No, we have not,” he added regarding the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and was revealed to the media in early September — but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t reveal her letter,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me for confidentiality and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
Her denial, however, apparently did not suit the president, who said at a rally on Saturday night: “I tell you, that was really bad body language.
It may not be, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behavior, the president hinted that Democrats were abusing the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power by all possible means.
“You’ve seen evil, you’ve seen disgust, you don’t care who they hurt and who they have to run over to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundees.
The Dundee Stars have redeemed themselves for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's match in Dundee by 5:3.
The Giants scored two goals with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home page, then Dwyer again scored for the Giants.
François Bouchard tied for the Dundees before two goals from Lundvald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 in the back on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the game in the fourth minute with 3:35 assisted by Kendall McFaull, and Beauvillier, who scored four minutes later, was passed by David Rutherford.
In the intensive opening game, Sullivan took the home page again at 13:10, and Matt Marquardt gave Cowny a tie at 15:16.
Dwyer took the lead of the Giants in the break when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The home side gathered again, and Bouchard made up for the lag with a violent goal at 27:37.
Together, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen lead Dundee in the lead at the end of the second third and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his half-time team, and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team in the half of the last third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
An air traffic controller killed hundreds of people on the plane and allowed them to escape from the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he sacrificed his life so that the plane with hundreds of people could take off safely.
Friday's earthquake on the island of Sulawesi, followed by the tsunami, killed more than 800 people and many are missing.
The area continues to be shaken by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained there so that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian media outlet ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter to transport it from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It breaks our hearts to hear that,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand, as the country’s disaster mitigation agency said access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutonga was limited.
“The death toll is expected to increase further as there were many bodies under the rubble, but many of them could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, was ravaged by waves as high as six meters.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo and addressed the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing after it was initially reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a post on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
They did not immediately respond to the request for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at an airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said eight passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had landed very low.
“It’s very good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to get through lane-to-belt water to emergency exits on a sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury himself.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were repairing the nearby pier also came to the rescue, using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in air accidents in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but this is the first accident that has happened to Air Niugini.
Analyst determined the time of night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented its evidence in a retrial on Saturday to a man accused of burning alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contradicting his previous claims, the Clarion Ledger newspaper reported.
When records showed that his cell phone was at Chambers’s at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said that he "was lying because [my] truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone footage shows they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers’ texts, calls and contact details from his phone during the time following Chambers’ death.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the trial was to be judged by a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The Hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, based in Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its original political and social commitment.
They want to go back to his roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
NYC babysitter sues couple for firing her for ‘racist’ message
A New York nanny is suing the couple for discriminating against her after receiving a misspelled message from her mother, who complained she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies racist behavior and compares the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment in 2016 when she found out that she was black when her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived.
“NEEEEEEE is just one more black woman,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After finding her slip-up, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “uncomfortable,” fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, was doing a poor job and wanted to hire a Filipina, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work, and then she was sent home by Uber.
Maurice is now seeking compensation from the couple in court of $350 a day for a period of six months for performing the job for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, you don’t do things like that,” she told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by arguing that Maurice’s dismissal was reasonable, fearing that they would no longer be able to trust her after the insult.
“She sent me something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We’re not racist,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
“Come on.”
Comparing the lawsuit to “emigration,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
Are you going to take on someone that way?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the court proceedings are still pending, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks for their behavior and way of thinking.
Publishers of Paddington Bear Stories Fear Readers Won't Connect With Talking Bear, New Letter Revealed
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s acceptance, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to find out now that Paddington has become a huge hit.”
She said her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he got inspired to write a children's book about the little toy bear, would have been outraged by the rejection of his work, adding that after his death last year, the book's 60th anniversary was "bitter-sweet."
Regarding the bear, Paddington, who she described as “a very important member of our family,” she said her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You are proud of him, even if you’re not really doing it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed success to the bear Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“She called Nad regularly to say she was really feeling bad, that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nada. He told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by the doctors to keep her heart pumping slowly faded and left her system.
She had been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit and wait, knowing all this was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the trial she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had my head bowed down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women glue posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to discourage others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys glue posters on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can contact for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he fell into depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminates every room.”
However, before his death, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a sibling when he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered.”
Ms. Davis made the posters to let other people know that there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if they’re a friend.
Don’t sit quietly – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been Davies's friend for many years, lost Marka, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the children opened the gifts, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma for them, but they have to rework it: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She tore us apart.
But we have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the air at the start of an FBI investigation
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – by the length and scope of a limited investigation, it might unify us,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the world would “disintegrate” because of the party’s stalemate.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
The midterm elections on Nov. 6 are only five weeks away — if Republicans cut short as expected, it will greatly weaken them in their attempt to elect the man they want to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has repeatedly telephoned senators to lobby for the support of Mr Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr Bush and who was introduced by him to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, the Vice President, a breakthrough from the stalemate and an election to the Supreme Court.
North Korean Refugees Decrease Under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said 1,127 people fled last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in the price demanded by human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not yet commented publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to pursue a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho attributed the US sanctions to a standstill since then.
“Without confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm,” Mr. Ri said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was “characterically unsuitable” for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything else but to call a woman, if she behaved like that, ‘hysterical,’” Kavanaugh’s testimony before a Senate committee of inquiry on Thursday was commented by Pelosi.
Kavanaugh denies allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the recital, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost yelling and choking when discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the commission and called the accusations against him “grotesque and coordinated defamation” organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he should not be appointed as a supreme judge, as it showed that he was biased toward Democrats.
“I think that with statements like that and the way he handled Clinton and the Democrats, he has been discredited,” she said.
When Pelosi is asked if she will try to bring a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, she becomes one for a moment.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh’s possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’”
And women have to snag him.
This is a just outburst, after months and years of outbursts of anger, and cannot express it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“That’s rare, don’t you think?”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere the director, who also cried when she was angry, but who developed a technique, namely, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I’m angry.’
Then she simply continued.
I thought it was top-notch.”
Tears are partly allowed as a way out of anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories of my early career, when I was still working in an office dominated by men, and I once found myself crying in unspeakable rage, was when an older woman grabbed my neck – a cold leader who was always a little afraid, who dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
"They won't understand that you're angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they beat you up.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over the fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to step out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply depressed, realized that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me in a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the game and one more was the last thing we needed.
Someone called the game ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.’”
Since the latter joined the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the game unless she collected $ 2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, her emotions—gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism—became so overwhelming that she began to choke.
“You would think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled the reaction of the media.
“You’d think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
‘Did she cry?’”
How the U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial salvoes of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and although the battle has long since ended, experts say the split between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has taken revenge each time with equivalent retaliation, most recently with tariffs ranging from 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to face the U.S. eye for an eye and is unlikely to wink soon.
In order for Washington to yield, China would have to agree to his demands, but a public submission by the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing can make the right moves, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic upheaval in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centered think tank at the Center for New American Security.
Syria ‘prepared’ for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al Moualem said the situation was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer due to the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily lives and livelihoods are now met.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
He said he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup against the US with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled through most of the championship, threw the ball into the water at the 16th hole in the pair-3 game in his initial kick, which forced him to hand over the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all the rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 at any time since the start of the championship in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten by 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranking player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The top-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played the last time in the Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of Ryder's eight Cups, became the most successful European player of all time with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it today.
This year has been tough.
I am very grateful to Thomas for lifting me up and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that we won the cup again.
It’s a team and I’m really happy to be able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The relay is handed over to compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1 in individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud that I was able to defeat Tiger Woods. When I was growing up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now holds a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time to win 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent a week trying helplessly to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the championship.
The American captain said after a bad performance for his team: “I am so proud of these guys, they fought.”
In the morning, we put a bit of pressure on Europe.
We've failed.
Hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to get back together, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to move on.
I really love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
Hat off.
They beat us.”
Red tide news: Concentrations on the coasts of Pinellas, Manatee and Saratosa counties are decreasing
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) shows an overall decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
The FWC has reported more diffuse flowering in the Pinellas, Manatee, Saratosa, Charlotte and Collier districts, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles from the coast of Pinellas County's north to Lee County's south.
The patches look about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
The red tide was also seen in Pasco County.
Last week, medium concentrations were reported in the Pinellas County and along its coast, low to high concentrations along the Hillsborough County coast, base to high concentrations in the Manatee County, base to high concentrations in the Saratosa County and along its coast, base to medium concentrations in the Leigh County, base to high concentrations in the Charlotte County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in Northwest Florida over the past week.
