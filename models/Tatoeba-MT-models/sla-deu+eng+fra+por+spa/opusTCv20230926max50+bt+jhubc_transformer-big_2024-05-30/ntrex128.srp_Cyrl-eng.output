Welsh MPs concerned about 'similarity to Muppets'
Some Members of the Assembly (AM) are appalled by the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was because it was planned to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of all political parties worry that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that the abbreviation "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means crazy, and pwp means crap.
A member of the assembly from the political party "Plaid" said that the group as a whole "is not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A Welsh member of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to name change, but noted that the MWP is pronounced similarly to the Muppets.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to that of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on the draft law on the introduction of name changes, made the following statement: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh government law gave the Welsh Parliament the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the generally accepted proposals for the appointment of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it came to the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission opted for the option Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the widest support in public consultations.
MPs are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be a headache for chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft bill on the changes within weeks.
Laws on reforms will also include other changes in the manner of work of the Assembly, including rules for disqualification of members of the Assembly and the plan of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will eventually vote for their own title during the debate on the aforementioned law.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country’s name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to accept the country's new name "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of a neighboring northern state represents its territory and has persistently opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Djordje Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin have subsided, and the churches in Haarlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I spoke to say that there used to be cafes and churches on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today there is no one else.”
For him, the lack of coffee is understandable.
“People are getting along differently these days,” he says.
“Cafés no longer play the role of living rooms from neighborhoods that people go to on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as executives expect “and sooner or later it will be back at the beginning.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of the kind of people who will not help the remaining shrines from the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that will accelerate the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that most of those people who move into these residential buildings will become members of them.”
Both churches built communities made up of whites before Haarlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist community moved away in the 1930s.
A black community that performed a worship service nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but since Father Johnson's parishioners decided to rebuild it, they commissioned the organ.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the organ “the organ of the poor.”
The expert who played the organ in July called them differently: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that these were the first organs in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather has stated that St. Martin has not replaced him.
What has happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were brought by secular leaders of the church, and others by the diocese of the bishops.
The parish administration – the governing body of the parish, composed of secular leaders – wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would seek to pass on the costs” to the parish administration, although the parish administration was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs that the diocese did.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old During Lobster Hunting in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the town of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy's calls for help, and then rode to him with the group to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just the excitement of the lobster catch, but then "he realized he was yelling 'She bit me!
It bit me.”
Members of the Assembly of all political parties worry that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
“I shouted to everyone out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
It is not known which species of shark attacked it.
Rescue supervisor Larry Giles said in a press release that a few weeks earlier, the shark had already been spotted in the area but had been found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had sustained traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
For reasons of investigation and security, officials closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to the Swami's area in the city of Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's is becoming a competition for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department stores with professional assistants.
As part of a significant breakthrough in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market in the UK, with that figure rising as sales in the fashion and home equipment markets decline, larger cosmetics departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and next year will open in more stores if they show up as a show.
Investing in cosmetics comes as supermarkets find ways to use shelf space after lawsuits for televisions, microwaves and home furnishings.
Sainsbury's has announced it will double its cosmetics offerings to as many as 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing product range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with areas for certain brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching the Boutique makeup palette to make most of the products suitable for vegans – which demand is on the rise when it comes to younger buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test points of sale at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second one opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and switching to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets have to make extra efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coop, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said the department’s outlet will increasingly resemble self-service as the supermarket chain tries to retaliate against sales outlets with large discounts from Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has opened Argos outlet departments in hundreds of stores and numerous Habitats departments since it bought both of these chains two years ago, saying it has boosted food sales and purchasing profitability.
A previous attempt by this supermarket to modernize the departments for cosmetics and pharmaceutical products ended infamously.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after winning a win in the distribution of revenue from pharmaceutical stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes into effect after Sainsbury’s sold a 281-store pharmaceutical company to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is said to play a role in this plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide a better environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at your service to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an indispensable destination for cosmetic products that sets new standards for the way we shop.”
Peter Jones ‘freaked out’ after Holly Willoughby withdrew from <0xC2><0xA3>11m job
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons Den series, became furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from the $11 million business with his personal brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Vilobi has no time for their brand of home and accessories Truly.
The couple's company collaborated with the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old announced her departure this morning via the social networking site Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons series Den, by pulling out of a lucrative deal with their brand at the last minute to focus on her own new lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the source, Jones was "furious" when a TV screen favorite during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to new offers worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m, there was no more time to dedicate to their Truly brand of home and accessories.
The company collaborated with actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was projected to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced via Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones went from Britain to one of his cottages.
According to the source, "Holly put the Truly brand at the very top of her priorities.
That was supposed to be her long-term plan to make money from over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch date.
The warehouse at Marlow Headquarters is packed with ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home equipment, as well as possible further delays of the launch date.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Kapova in 2016, and in March Jones, 52, joined them as the company's CEO.
These couples spend the holidays together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production house.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ent McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
After the hard words “sympathy was shown”
He has been criticized in the media for comments that some say are “not worthy of a president” and for his positive stance on the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump withdrawing so much?
Trump said imitating the voice of a TV commentator.
“I’m not withdrawing from anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump praised their initial June meeting in Singapore as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization, however, stalled.
MOSCOW (Reuters) - More than three months after a June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that there was no “appropriate response” from the United States to North Korea’s initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he stressed, the United States does not lift sanctions that exert continuous pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are making great progress with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would suffer.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He noted that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – missile tests have ended, hostages have been released and the remaining US troops have returned home.
He defended this unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be a good president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd right in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so we are facing certain difficulties,” Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palo, it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Given the constant earthquakes that are shaking Indonesia, it is sad how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shores.
The loss of life was probably also contributed by the apparent failure to sound the tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect.
Traveling between numerous Indonesian islands is otherwise a challenge.
Natural disasters further hamper logistics.
A hospital ship stationed on the island of Lombok to assist earthquake victims is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of another disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure and did not save money for roads and railways.
However, the lack of financial resources has hit Mr. Yoko's administration, and next year he faces re-election.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure that creates long-lasting sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cruel weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starridge, Liverpool player, manages to score a tie point against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starridge received a pass from Gerdan Shaqiri 27 metres from Chelsea when his team lost 1–0.
First he moved the ball to the left side, then kicked to the farthest part of the net.
The ball went high above the goal in the direction of the top right corner of the net.
She eventually flew over goalkeeper Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to catch her and fell into the net.
I was just trying to set myself up for the shot, and players like Shaqiri are always playing forward as much as possible, so I just tried to fight for as much time as possible," Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, I touched one ball and he just kicked, without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1–0 in the half after the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The striker returned the ball to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> with the fifth, then turned in the middle of the field and ran to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> exchanged a few short shots in the middle of the field.
Then he pointed a brilliant centrifuge, leading Azar towards the goal.
Hazard overtook the defense and directed the final shot with his left foot to the farthest part of the net next to Alison Becker, a Liverpool player.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meets Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Tuesday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia jumped to 832, according to the disaster management agency on Sunday morning.
Numerous reports have arrived for people trapped in the rubble of buildings hit by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Indonesia on Friday and triggered waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was buried with the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Burkenhead, Merseyside County.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. stabbed in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have summoned people in the area who have seen or heard anything to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would call anyone who has been near John Street in Burkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a camera on the dashboard to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lives in Burkenhead and was found on the property.
This afternoon, friends who feel they know this woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are currently informing the victim's closest relative.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him everyone was banned from entering and leaving the building.
He was left speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told that they would be allowed to return in a few hours.
Rumor has it that a police officer told a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the spot.
She kept saying, “This is terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon with another van in the front.
Several police officers stood in the cordon watching the blocks of flats.
Everyone who has some information is invited to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and provide a record 247 dated September 30th.
A statue of Cromwell in front of the parliament building is the subject of the latest debate on the monuments because of the quarrel about the “falsification of history”
Its removal would be poetic justice for its Taliban-style destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to falsify history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Palace of Westminster was an inevitable target in the ongoing debate on the removal of statues.
Cromwell neither issued an order nor conducted iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hameau Turnicroft testifies to a 19th-century opinion and is part of the historiography of a figure that, according to many, still deserves to be glorified.
Mr. Goldsmith made the following statement to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
The authenticity of this description has been the subject of constant debate throughout history.
What is certain is that this mid-17th-century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell as an individual is a recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His successes as a Lord Protector also deserve to be praised and kept from oblivion."
A murderous pig inflicted fatal injuries on a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty in the town of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.
The owner of a pig farm is preparing to inject pigs in Xinying, Qinghai Province, China.
He allegedly came Wednesday with a cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
A relative found him dead the next morning and noticed that the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the pigsty that had blood on its mouth.
Forensic investigations have confirmed that a 250-pound pig inflicted fatal injuries on the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and crippled,” said a relative named “Wu,” according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Juan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so it would not attack anyone again, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Juan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, there are already recorded cases of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, injuring a man critically.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig held a Welsh farmer nailed to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon peasants were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba peasant told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be a trigger.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread showers to the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, the Rosa will bring showers to the north of Maxix and the southwest of the United States, which will lead to flooding.
The dew, with winds of 137 km/h, was a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday morning at 5 a.m. Eastern Time and was located 620 km southwest of the Punta Eugenia settlement in Mexico.
Ross is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure field begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastwards, towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push high tropical moisture northwards, towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity due to contact with a low-pressure field approaching will lead to widespread showers in the southwest.
The amount of rain from 2.5 to 10 cm in local areas will cause dangerous torrential flooding, the spread of rubble by water and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
High tropical moisture will occasionally cause rainfall of about 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 cm of rain is also expected in some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Tumultuous floods are possible with a sharp deterioration of conditions due to the unrestrained nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely reckless to walk into the desert as tropical rains threaten.
Due to heavy rainfall, canyons can turn into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to stormy winds and dust in the air.
The approaching low-pressure field will bring locally strong rain in some parts of the southern California coast.
Precipitations of more than 1.5 cm are possible, which can cause less waterborne debris and slippery roadways.
This will be the first rainfall in the region for their rainy season.
Mystical tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and on Monday evening and Tuesday the rains will cover a wider area.
The showers will extend to the southwestern Colorado, southeastern Utah, northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, high temperature fluctuations across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, while in the tropics the weather will remain fairly warm.
This sometimes causes huge temperature differences over short distances.
A great example is the dramatic temperature differences in the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees.
The long-lasting summer heat will grow and spread again in the next few days.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected with temperatures of 27 degrees Celsius across much of the country, from the southern plains to the northeast.
Temperatures in New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Bret Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court justice nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blazey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurring in the 1980s, on six television channels on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political crisis has continued, with television companies cutting off Friday’s regular programming due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake under which the FBI is to conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Cavanaugh was groping her and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a touching testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it hadn’t happened.
That was probably watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to a Nielsen report.
She calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that displayed this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
At the same time, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of viewers in offices.
By comparison, that number of viewers can compete with the audience following a playoff football match or an Oscar.
The Fox News Channel, with the hosts of the show "Opinion" who strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, recorded the highest viewership of any network with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
This process aroused great interest even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama that unfolded on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office said it would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning filmed protesters yelling at him as he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee hearing.
He stood for a few minutes looking down as he was insulted, which was broadcast live by CNN.
“Here I am standing in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said to him, ‘You have power, and so many women are helpless.’”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he had more to say at the committee's hearing.
All the cable and television companies were broadcasting live hours later when the Judiciary Committee was supposed to vote to forward Kavanaugh's candidacy to the full Senate.
However, Flake said he would only agree to this on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the nominee over the next week, a demand persistently made by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Koons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was weighted because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of 'playing politics' in Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is attending a Conservative Party conference on September 29, 2018 in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview besides the one with her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Brexit Checkers plan, calling the proposal for a single customs zone between Britain and the EU “completely meaningless”.
The murder of Wade Simms: the police arrested the suspect Dateon Simpson for the death of a player of the University of Louisiana
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old University of Louisiana basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a WAFB channel connected to the CBS network.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to Wade's fatal wound with a gunshot.
He was given a $350,000 bail, a lawyer said.
The parish pathologist's office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report Friday citing a bullet wound through the head to the neck as the cause of death.
The department attributes credit for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrests to the Louisiana State Police Operations Unit for the capture of fugitives, the State Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department, and local residents.
The head of the University of Louisiana’s athletics department, Joe Aleva, thanked local law enforcement for its “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Simms was 20 years old.
The 2-meter-tall wingman grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
The previous zone scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“It’s something we’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano Ejects Ashes on Mexico City
The ash that erupts from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes due to increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
This center has recorded more mild seismological activity.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in Mexico City municipalities, such as Hocimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters clashed with the interventionist police, while thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations on the first anniversary of a Catalan secession vote that divided the population.
A group of masked separatists, restrained by the intervening police, threw eggs and dust paint at them, and dark clouds of dust formed in the streets usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, there was also a brawl that police officers restrained with buckles.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" in the face of protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received help for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
Tensions have not faded in the independence-ridden region even a year after a referendum held on October 1 that separatist Catalans are celebrating, even though Madrid declared it illegal.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, although the turnout was small as a mass of people opposed secession boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Independence groups camped out on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police force.
The demonstrations were held, but the route had to be changed.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who accompanied his wife to protest the separatists, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the brightest moments.
“My parents were crying with joy that they were able to vote, but now we are in a deadlock,” he said.
Despite achieving a key but narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan pro-independence parties have had difficulty continuing in the same spirit this year, as many of their most famous leaders have either been in self-imposed exile or in detention in a referendum where they await their bodies' trial.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to record a protest in support of police, said the clash was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is all tense,” he said.
Oriol Hunqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since late last year, has announced he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"Highlighting the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after crashing car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing into a Londoner home.
The incident took place on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent Street at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said the entrance and the building itself were damaged.
It is also possible that at some point a crossbow was fired at the house.
Score Menge brings Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Meng wins first goal for Livingston
Livingston surprised the Rangers by forcing Steven Gerrard to admit only his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Manga brought a change with his goal, as Gary Holt's team equated with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team this season remains without a away win in the Premier League, and next week they meet with the leaders in the table of the Harts, behind by eight points.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the division's unbeaten streak to six games, with head coach Holt not yet defeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against uninspired guests
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before the goal he scored, as the offensive game caused problems for the Rangers at all levels.
Scott Robinson broke through, but wore the ball in front of the goal, so Alan Litgow kicked it past the net after slipping in to receive a header kick from Craig Hulkett in front of the goal.
The hosts gladly let Rangers players play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to cause difficulties to the visiting team with the actions they played.
That’s how they scored the goal.
The Rangers made a foul, and Livingston opened the game after a free kick by employing Declan Gallagher and Robinson by a combination of Meng, who passed the ball to the goal from the middle of the sixteenth.
In the previous part of the game, the Rangers dominated possession, but could not break through the home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have any major problems,
The same style continued in the second half, although Kelly had to defend one shot from Alfred Morelos.
Alan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, repulsed Scott Pittman's attack and Litgow scored next to the goal in Livingston's second-placed action.
Livingston defended several centers, and two penalty kicks were denied – following Halket's objection to replacing Glenn Middleton and one for playing handball.
Livingstone's "Phenomenal Game" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
All players, without exception, were outstanding and again exceeded expectations on this upward trajectory.
Since returning to the front lines, they have not even almost changed the style of play and people, but one should give great credit to Holt for the way he brought liveliness to the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett was unsurpassed in leading a highly organized defense, while Meng kept Conor Goldson and Joe Voral on alert all the time.
However, the Rangers were not inspired.
No matter how good he used to be under Gerard, he fell well below that level.
They couldn’t score – they only broke through the host’s defense once – and it’s a kind of alarm bell for the Rangers, located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan stumbled upon a mixed reception in Cologne
The meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) during breakfast in Berlin was accompanied by mixed reactions.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This city is home to the largest part of the Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many supporters found themselves nearby to see their president.
There were also calls from hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of whom were Kurds – who condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting protests reflect a divided view of the visitor, who some Turks in Germany call a hero, while others accuse him of being an autocrat.
Road accident in Depford: Cyclist killed in car crash
In a car crash in London, a cyclist was killed.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics showed him help, but the man died on the spot.
A few months before the collision, another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the Saturday collision, which the driver hit and fled.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six prison police officers were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, the prison facility said.
The riots, which are still ongoing, occurred at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. British summer time.
A team of Tornado specialists was brought in to deal with the unrest, which was reduced to one wing and in which eight prisoners took part.
Police officers were shown assistance on the spot due to minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison officers have been brought in for the current incident at Her Majesty Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received help for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and our position is clear that those responsible will be reported to the police, which is why they could be held behind bars for longer.”
Her Majesty Long Lartin’s prison has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the state.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the interventionist police were summoned to prison for serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
The cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened by Hurricane Rosa with torrential flooding (which can come in handy to areas affected by drought)
Tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but is likely to occur early next week as Hurricane Rosa moves across the desert in the southwest, bringing with it the risks of torrent flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make direct landfall in Phoenix on Tuesday, with her approach announced by rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression at 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) hit a region 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm, with amounts up to 15 cm in isolated places, such as Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
In other desert areas in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5–5 cm, with possible totals in isolated areas of up to 10 cm.
For areas where there is no fear of torrential flooding, the rains that the Rosa will bring can be a blessing since the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious cause for concern, rain will be welcome in some parts because the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Surveillance Agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit at least by extreme drought, a category of second-class drought.
The route of Hurricane Rosa first leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning still had hurricane strength with maximum winds of 135 kilometers per hour, is currently 620 kilometers south of the Punta Eugenia settlement in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it has lost its force.
That is why it is expected that the landslide in Mexico will occur when the storm reaches the intensity of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is possible, which carries a significant risk of flooding.
"A total rainfall of 8 to 15 centimeters is expected from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora state, with a possible 10 centimeters," weather.com reports.
The dew will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then moving upward through Arizona and arriving in southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or its remnants is very heavy rain in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the American desert in the southwest," the National Hurricane Monitoring Center said in a statement.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening torrential flooding and the spreading of debris by water in deserts and landslides on hilly terrain.
Midsomer Norton City Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
After a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Sommerst, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The injured teenager was found on Excelsior Terrace in the town of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
During the night, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the town of Radstock, police Avon and Somerset said.
Police have asked anyone who may have footage of the event on their mobile phones to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and shameful tactics,” Trump said in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
In a vigorous and emotional testimony before Congress on Thursday, Cavanaugh denied claims by Christine Blazy Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At this hearing, Ford also testified to her claims.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw all the ingenuity, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“A positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-rate biography in public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination during a speech on the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“Although I’m not running personally, I’m actually running,” he said.
“We’re all fighting for great candidates.”
Trump has concluded that Democrats are on a mission of “resisting and disrupting.”
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected no later than Friday, according to a senior GOP executive assistant to CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia left hundreds dead, and the number continues to rise.
At least 384 people were killed, many by giant waves that hit the beaches when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on Friday for a beach festival when six-meter-high waves hit the shore at dawn, taking many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When he threatened a tsunami yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach, instead of immediately escaping and thus becoming victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency BNPB, in a press release.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses and hit everything on earth,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster mitigation agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The quake hit the coastal town again on Saturday.
In an area where 2.4 million people live, an earthquake struck.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said Friday's devastating earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographic features of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, contributed to the development of a greater severity of the tsunami," he said.
Nugroho said the damage was "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said more losses and damage were possible along the coast 300km north of the city of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
Communications “were completely cut off and there was no information” from Dongal, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” the statement said.
The agency received criticism from various parties on Saturday that it did not issue a notice that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared via social media, a man on the top floor of the building is heard shouting from stained veins, warning people on the street of an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still needed food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport is reopened only for incoming help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
World Vision staff arrived safely from Dongala to the city of Palu, where employees are hiding in waterproof canvas shelters set up in the office yard and on their way to the city they were greeted by scenes of destruction and devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is extremely bad.
Even when aid groups began taking the first steps in mitigating the disaster, there were complaints that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of overseas funds, supplies and people is possible only if the place of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still characterised as a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When state institutions declare a national disaster, we can enable international assistance, but so far there is no such status.”
When the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that befell it on Friday, friends and families of the missing continued to cherish the hope that their loved ones would somehow miraculously escape the sad fate of the victims of natural disasters.
The boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
Rescuers on Sunday freed a woman from underneath the rubble who had been trapped next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse reached the paraglider community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who were participating in a beach festival.
However, his messages wore only one gray marking, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was charging an ATM at the Newport on the Levee facility on Friday morning, according to the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and was preparing to put in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “runs behind the back of a Brink’s employee” and steals a bag of money he was supposed to put into an ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is invited to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to "Ye".
Announcing the change on Saturday on his Twitter account, he wrote: “It will once be known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, so he used it to name his eighth album, which was released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to announce a new album, Yandhi.
He was invited to the show instead of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible and it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am all of us, that is us.
From the name Kanye, which means ‘one’, I have moved to just ‘Ye’ (you) – which is the personification of all that is good, bad and vague in us.
This album is basically a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, known by his nicknames Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, said this year that he would like to be referred to as "Love" and "Brother Love".
West's former associate, Jay-Z, used the nickname with or without dashes and capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians on the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in a square in Tlatelolco that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
Troops fired on peaceful protesters gathered in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were based in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving financial aid to those who study every month and opening up more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and the inability to get an education push young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double artificial intelligence funding
As China becomes more active in the development of artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount it spends on research in this area, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various foreign governments announced the development of artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy for doing so.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the AI research budget, as all other countries are so lagging behind the United States, and we are striving for new progress in this domain,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Super-Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, works as the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent+ artificial intelligence companies, Face.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later served as director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee paid tribute to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the U.S. Department of Defense’s “Robot Challenge” agency responsible for the development of new technologies (DARPA), and asked when the next one would take place to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state scholarships, Lee said.
“It’s not academic leaders going to China, it’s going to big corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent minds from universities to work on developing artificial intelligence.
Lee points out that changes in immigration policies could help the U.S. strengthen its pursuits in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council unveiled a plan to develop a new generation of artificial intelligence.
The China National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, with the quality of academic work lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which will include partners from the sector and the academy, while the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called “Next Generation Artificial Intelligence.”
On the other hand, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than 100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that required the establishment of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country’s name
Macedonians on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", ending a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked their bids for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring northern state represents the ownership of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would jeopardize the ethnic identity of the Macedonian, mostly Slavic population.
President Djordje Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach a minimum of 50 percent, as needed for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question on the ballot paper reads: "Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying in exchange for membership in alliances such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
While this is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would comply with the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters went to the polls.
"I went to vote because of my children, because our place is in Europe," said <0xC4><0x90>o<0xC5><0xA1>e Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, with his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country’s name, which should open the country’s path to NATO and European Union membership.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and places chairs in front of the tents set up by opponents of the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join upright heads, not through the entrance for the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after the vote.
He added that the “for” result would be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will go to the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, concluded that 57 percent of voters will vote in the referendum.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote “yes.”
In order for the referendum to succeed, half of the registered voters plus one are required to vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling defeated Brighton 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
That seemed too easy when Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the pitch from where the attack began.
He ran between Brighton's three defensive players and mowed them all down in an open field.
Then Aguera was surrounded by four green shirts.
He outplayed one defending player, then overtook several more on the edge of the goal of Brighton.
Then he kicked the ball to the left, finding Sterling.
The English wingman immediately returned the ball to Aguero, who with his right kick defeated goalkeeper Brighton Matthew Ryan by kicking to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has certain problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, Manchester City manager, told reporters.
“We agreed to play for 55, 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
However, the initial advantage of the Sky Blues in the Premier League meeting was brought by Sterling.
He scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He made a beautiful pass to Leroy Sein on his left flank.
Shane had several contacts with the ball before hiring Sterling on another tripod.
The Sky Blue striker threw the ball into the net, then immediately slipped out of the field.
Manchester City meets Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in a group match of the Champions League at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against Rocky in a non-competitive game for the Nationals
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there were not many reasons to insist on another game.
However, competitive Sherzer hopes to take the position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have one game of advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers, are still in play for the playoffs.
The Rockys secured a wild-card spot Friday night with a 5-2 win over Nationals, but are still trying to win the division's first title.
“Although we can’t win anything, at least we can go on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team will probably be at the highest level against any point I’d play this year.
Why shouldn’t I take part in such a competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for the week, but are reportedly considering letting Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th time to open the game, held training on Thursday and will throw on Sunday when he normally rests.
Washington's right-handed player leads 18-7 this season with an average of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation of his candidate for Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, during a speech on the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have achieved will be put at stake in November.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the biggest ones – although I am not running personally, I am actually running and that is why I am fighting for great candidates on all sides,” he said.
Trump continues: “Look at this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s happening now.
They are determined to regain power without choosing the means, see the wickedness, dirty games.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of “resisting and disrupting.”
“You could see that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, vile, disgusting and dishonest.”
He mentioned Democratic senator and member of the Judiciary Committee Diane Feinstein by name, which caused a loud outcry from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Ugh, what.
No, no, I’m waiting for it – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my censorship, it almost didn’t surprise me.
I’m just the last in a row of Labour MPs who were told they weren’t welcome – just because we expressed our opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan River, went through a similar thing because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship initiative followed criticism for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe – the irony is that these are similar topics on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
A notice for a meeting at the Labour Party in eastern Nottingham on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive.”
Since I was a Labour MP for eight years, the General Committee meetings on Friday evenings have generally been just like that.
Unfortunately, meetings in this spirit are rarely held today, and the promise of a “nobler, more moderate” policy has long been forgotten, if ever such aspirations.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged according to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared similar political views began to expect me to change them from the ground up and take positions I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was national security or the EU’s single market.
Every public address I make – regardless of what I say – follows a tyranny of abuse on social networks that calls for the annulment of my election, condemns the policy of the center, says that I have no place in the Labour Party.
I’m not the only one with that experience.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day without ever being distracted by it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that various types of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The true truth is that we no longer accept different views and with each vote of no confidence or change of election rules, the party becomes more and more blunt.
Over the past two years, I’ve often been advised, inviting me to lower my head, keep my opinion to myself, and then “be tuned.”
But it's at odds with my political goals.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago from school, provoked by the negligence of the government by Margaret Thatcher who let my school classroom literally collapse, I have strived to fight for better public services to those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or minister in government.
I never hid my political commitment, not even in the last election.
No one in eastern Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political beliefs and topics on which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this initiative on Friday, I would just say that, at moments when our country is rushing towards a Brexit that will threaten households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
Yet my only message is not to Momentum of Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of nullifying my choice or political tricks will prevent me from acting in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the ambassador for East Nottingham.
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Air climbs to the top
The two late essays may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr took a well-deserved victory in this exciting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
Now they are at the top of the table, as the only undefeated side out of a total of ten.
In the end, the home team took over thanks to the superior defense, as well as the greater number of chances used and coach Peter Murchy had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in the games so far and we haven't lost yet, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose team said, "All praise to Ir, they've used their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute essay, turned by Frasier Klimo, gave Ira an advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was pulled out of the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage.
Klimo penalized Ira's lead, before he scored and converted a solo essay in the half so that Ira could score 17–5 on the break.
However, Melrose had a good start to the second half, and the essay by Patrick Anderson, who was turned by Baghot, reduced the lag to five points.
There was then a prolonged standstill due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was carried out on a stretcher, and Ir further increased his leadership with an essay by Stafford McDowell, who was converted by Klimo.
Subsequently, Deputy Captain Ira, Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the player's advantage more by Bruce Colvin failing to turn the essay, after a brief fierce pressure.
However, the host side returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for wrestling with Clima without a ball, from the penalty area, McPherson scored a point-down behind Mall Ira in the attack.
Klimo turned the essay, which he did again almost immediately after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth home page essay.
“Still Game” star is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning he’s been named CEO of a company that owns licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old portrays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, in which he writes and stars alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the series and Kiernan seems to be making plans for life after Creglang.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "successful restaurant sector" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia deprived of access to the sea hopes courts will allow it access to the Pacific again
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
On public buildings the flag of the color of the ocean is whirling.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the slogan: “We have a full right to the sea.
We owe it to him.”
In Bolivia, deprived of access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of coastline in the bloody resource conflict with Chile in the 19th century, and with it the longing for another voyage in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the biggest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice’s decision on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia’s current developments are in favour, it is governed by a spirit of unity and calm and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calsadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of talks, Chile is under an obligation to negotiate the granting of a sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial re-election battle next year – the verdict to be handed down on Monday also carries many risks.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and that little would change even if it happened.
The Dutch-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and said it would not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the verdict of the International Court of Justice is delivered just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only has the case of Bolivia not progressed, but the previous four years may have set it back.
“The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has killed off any affection for Chile, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagreed with the claim that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given an “extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – who remains one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the question of the sea as a political backbone.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“This verdict is an opportunity to see the necessity of overcoming the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it doesn’t trust the US
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never end their nuclear weapons program if they don’t have confidence in Washington.
Ri delivered a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on promises made during a summit in Singapore in talks between conflicting leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to restart deadened diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons more than three months after meeting with North Korean Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri says it’s just a dream come true that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to accept the declaration until Pyongyang makes significant steps in the disarmament process.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang’s renouncing its nuclear arsenal, which its country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest lines of bulky head covering accessories you’ll soon see on the nearby Main Street
If you want to enrich the collection of hats with more bulky models or to completely block the sun, the quest is over.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown on the runway presented a series of crazy huge head accessories from their spring/summer 2019 collection that overshadowed everyone at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats set Instagram on fire this summer, and these designers displayed their impressive creations on the catwalk.
Among Valentine's pieces, the most prominent was an over-accented beige hat decorated with a wide rim resembling feathers that swallowed the model's heads with its size.
Other bulky accessories include jewelled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple—but they’re not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also presented a collection of bizarre masks – at the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sutured lips and were more suited to Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled a scuba gear complete with a snorkel and a mask, while the other looked like melted ice cream in a cornet.
And if you follow the trend of attracting attention with bulky fashion details – you’re in luck.
Those who follow the trends predict that huge hats could soon be worn along nearby main streets.
The bulky hats follow the appearance of the popular straw hat "La Bomba" with a two-meter-wide rim that has been walked by many celebrities - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult etiquette on this impractical hat, which overwhelmed social media, stood behind another great creation depicted on the runway—straw beach bags almost the same size as the model in the swimsuit she was wearing.
Jaquemousse’s collection “La Riviera” for spring/summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week featured the most prominent orange-colored raffia bag, trimmed with raffia and a white leather handle on top.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive at the main street next summer – since the designer made such a boom, it would be hard to ignore such a demand for bulky accessories.”
John Edward: Language proficiency is crucial for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland boast outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding test scores, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service for students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, a chosen career and a place in society as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject of choice for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language that they understand, it will get into their head.
If you speak his native language, it will touch his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s tests, we see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students got a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72% of those learning German, 69% of those learning French and 63% of those learning Spanish also got an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland value foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject of choice, given the same importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
In a 2014 survey of the UK Commission on Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited as the main problems in filling vacancies were attributed to lack of language skills.
That is why language skills are given more and more importance in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given the multiple potential business opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because they possess a skill like this for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person who speaks more languages above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent said they did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language to be spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
Knowing more languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
At each school in Scotland, different languages will be taught.
Some schools will focus on more classically modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are skilled in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever awaits them in the future.
It cannot be denied that in today’s global business environment, languages are still crucial for the future of the country, so they must have their place in education as well.
Modern languages, in fact, should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice, diversity and outstanding achievements.
It's going to be fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is coming to an end for fans who want to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his exact minute has yet to be determined.
"There will be more than one, and fewer than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to have a limited time.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off a series of rallying in his election campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five Trump rallies planned for next week, with holdings in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote postponed to confirm his candidacy for a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans face the risk of losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
What time will Trump hold a rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia below online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over allegations of sexual harassment, with the expected Senate confirmation vote postponed by a week until the FBI completes its investigation.
However, this series of rallies is held primarily to help Republicans gain support ahead of the November election.
As part of President Trump’s campaign, the five rallies to be held next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“The importance of congressional control is so great for his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible at the start of the crowded campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, with media coverage from Pittsburgh," West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump's visit to West Virginia, a state where he won the 2016 election with more than 40 percent points, will be the second in a month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican senator Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come in to try to raise him in the polls,” Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Resolve to Fight to Stay in Game to Meet Sunday’s Singles Matches
After three one-sided sessions, a Saturday afternoon doubles tournament may be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
Although momentum variability is a fictional sporting concept, players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, on whose side would you say it's a momentum now?
“They had a lead of six points, and now four, so you can say that the momentum is on our side,” Jordan Spit said.
Europe, of course, is ahead of us with four points of advantage and another twelve in the game.
Although Americans, according to Spita, get a little wind in the back and have a lot on their side, especially the form of Spita and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each has three points out of four.
Spit was murderous from the first to the last blow and gave everyone homework.
The exclamations of delight grew louder during his round, until he eventually played a key final kick and received a fourth match with the same result when he and Thomas lagged two after two.
His final blow to the 15-hole match was greeted with a similar scream, reflecting the belief that the American team did not fall out.
“Basically, you just have to do your best and take care of your own match,” Spit said.
That’s all these players can do.
18 holes to leave a seal.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly the story of the Ryder Cup.
The unusual and at the same time charming European couple won all four matches and played without error.
The Molywoods were the only couple who did not play the punch gods on Saturday afternoon, but avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the second half on Friday morning.
The game they have shown so far and the way they exchange energy with a noisy audience have cemented them as Sunday’s top favourites and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory at sunset over Le Golf National’s pitches.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Beetle Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Serge Garcia, the morning hero in a four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The gods and double gods in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they never even managed to emerge.
But on Sundays, there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
The four-ball game and tournament pairs are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the tips they give and the tips they don’t give and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has a great lead before the final day, but this session of the doubles tournament also showed that the US team has a desire for a fight that some have doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of final day in Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead, as after Saturday's matches in the four-ball game and in the doubles tournament, it gained an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspiring couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, took the lead with two wins over the disgruntled Tiger Woods, boosting the score so far at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Björn's European side, which fought to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the inaccurate American side in the morning four-ball game and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. provided greater resistance in the doubles tournament, winning two matches, but could not narrow the gap.
Jim Furik's side must score eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in the first four matches.
After running over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then teamed up brilliantly and defeated the pumped-up Woods and American debutant Bryson Deschambeau with an even more convincing 5-4.
Woods, who sneaked through two matches on Saturday, shone for a moment, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in a four-ball game and in a doubles tournament and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the doubles tournament and suffered a 2-1 defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka – first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not go as planned on this pleasant, clear day southwest of Paris.
Majors triple winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They struggled to win 2–1 over John Ramm and Ian Pulter in a four-ball game, only to return later and beat Pulter and Rory McElroy 4–3 in a doubles tournament after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back after a four-point gap to the singles matches, although Furik's side, which is defending the title, is tied enough to keep the trophy.
However, after already two days in second place, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday would be beyond their means.
North Korea says 'no talk' of unilateral disarmament unless trust is established
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen its mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong-ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures" over the past year to show goodwill, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and vowing not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, there is no appropriate reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no question that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri has echoed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for step-by-step steps, his statement was significant because it did not exclude unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent U.S. president and North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work to “denuclearize the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with a security crane.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also defied calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is not giving up 'denuclearization first' and is increasing the level of pressure with sanctions in order to achieve its goal by force, even resisting the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The fact that they think they can bring us to our knees with sanctions is just the empty dreams of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the extension of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If we were negotiating this denuclearization issue with South Korea rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a dead end.”
Despite this, the tone of Rio’s speech differed drastically from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea’s land-based missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps for disarmament, but said there was much more to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had not set a timeline for this, saying: “If it’s going to take two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be strictly and unrelentingly enforced until complete, final, confirmed denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously backed sanctions against North Korea, which have been in place since 2006, in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made and that North Korea would condemn him for making “gangster demands” after just a few hours.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle the missile range and nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on How to Get Enough Sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students to sleep more in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning “all night long with the help of caffeine.”
One academic noted that the world’s number one university students are often ignorant of basic self-care.
Charles Chaizler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has devised a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea of this course came after a speech he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl finally came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my final year of college?’
She said that no one ever told her how important the dream was – which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
In this course, held for the first time this year, students are presented with the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports results, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says the university decided to introduce this course after it was noticed that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course encompasses a range of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a room in a student dormitory and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second part, participants listen to how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as everyone has a right to know what the health consequences of smoking cigarettes are,” added Professor Chaizler.
The culture of pride in “sleeping up all night” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation becoming a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and quality, should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess weight, since due to lack of sleep, the brain goes into starvation mode, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Chaizler design the course, after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says that this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate for its maintenance at the level of the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be for all graduates to be required to pass a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chaizler recommended that students think about setting their alarms at bedtime and wake time, and take care of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga defeated Gerrard's team with a goal
The Rangers suffered another downturn when Dolly Meng kicked Stephen Gerrard in a 1–0 loss to Livingston.
The team from Ibrox Stadium sought to win their first away win after a February 4–1 win at St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only inflicted Gerrard's second defeat as manager in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unattainable leader Ladbrokes.
Meng kicked seven minutes before the half, and the Rangers' uninspired line-up never came close to a tie.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston is climbing third behind Hibernian only because of the goal difference.
The Rangers may face additional problems after line judge Calum Spence had to seek help for a head wound after being side-kicked with an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ire and qualified for the semi-finals of the Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, opted for the same eleven Livingston players who scored a point with the Harts last week and would have been delighted with the way his well-trained squad pushed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
He was close to scoring a goal just two minutes after Meng sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Alan McGregor with the first pass in the empty space, but the midfielder missed a big chance and kicked past the goal.
Kegan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Hulket with a deep free kick, but his defensive partner Alan Litgow kicked next to a goal on another tripod.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last line gave more hope than faith in themselves.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lawles collided, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored only two goal kicks in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, without much trouble defended the head shot by Lasana Koulibaly and tame the shot directed by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the real balance of forces during the game, no one can deny that he was deserved if for nothing else, then for the effort he put in.
The Rangers were once again unable to cope with Jacobs' deep-seated action.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pulled the ball through to Slot Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard responded to the break by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Koulibaly, and the replacement was almost immediately successful when the wingman hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to induce guests to play just the way that suits them, with the long balls of Litgou and Halket.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor held well and defended the Jacobs attack, then sent Litgow from the corner with his head past the goal.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers' replacement, at the end of the game was looking for another penalty when he got into trouble with Jacobs, but Thomson again did not react.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger devised a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the main pillars of science, Geiger's counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Coronada Bell", starring the seemingly incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: “What is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's really heard!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to Recognize Damaged Cells
A New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to Recognize and Kill Perverted Cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells as part of treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein that is common in many cancers, and then inject them again
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients suffering from various types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells, ovarian cancer withdrew for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein that occurs in many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells has worked well in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined in fierce attacks in defense of Trump, wearing a MAGA-labeled hat, after a guest appearance on the SNL show.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was scouted into the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unrelated speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for a political office in 2020.
After performing his third song, “Ghost Town,” with the slogan “Make America Great,” that night, he delivered a fierce speech against the Democrats and again backed Trump.
“So many times I’ve talked to white people who would say to me, ‘How can you support Trump when he’s a racist?’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show aired a sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blazy Ford's sexual abuse allegations.
Although not aired, comedian Chris Rock posted a video of West's violent speech on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West with this announcement.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
“I was threatened behind the scenes.
They told me, “Don’t go out with that hat.”
They threatened me!
And then they say I sank,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see what that looks like?" adding, "I'm going to put on Superman's cloak because that means you can't command me.
Then spread the love."
The audience whispered his remarks at least twice and seemed uncomfortable to members of the SNL cast, Variety reports, while one of the attendees told the magazine: "The whole studio is in turmoil."
West replaced singer Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMuller, passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with his performance of "I Love It", disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not stepping down before the evildoers."
However, TV host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “his own and it’s absolutely beautiful.”
“But my choice is NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) who I believe embraces and loudly exalts an ideology that is bad for my community.
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper posted on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "sometimes known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name – before him did Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pippi Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Leone and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to a performer previously known as Prince.

The Public Prosecutor's Office will consider the allegations.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington condemns macho culture
Keith Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones, a medieval fantasy full of violence.
However, the 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that because of such roles on the screen, young men often feel like they have to be rude to gain respect.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith expressed his view that "something went wrong" and addressed how to deal with the problem of a pernicious macho culture in the #JaIsto era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he had a “strong need” to talk about the issue.
“I’m personally rather concerned right now with the question – where did we go wrong with the representation of masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men growing up about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of a disastrous macho culture because of the portrayal of characters posing as male.
He added: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is it that we are taught on TV and in the streets that makes young men feel they have to fit into a certain mold of male behavior?
I think that’s actually one of the major questions of our time – how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the young man.”
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the prequels or sequels to the series "Game of Thrones" after its end next summer, saying that he "was finished with the battlefields and horses".
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard’s theatrical play True West – a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers dating his current wife, Rose, to be the best thing that the series “Game of Thrones” has brought him.
“In this series, I met my current wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love partner of Keith's character John Snow, in this fantastic series that won an Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in cases
China has announced a jump in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS of 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the virus was transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of transfusions of blood infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sex is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Studies estimate that, due to conservative beliefs in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually marry women.
The transmission of the virus often occurs due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff released data on GOP senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff posted personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those lawmakers.
A Democrat in Los Angeles pointed out that the claims were placed by experts and websites of the “ultra-right wing”.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Bret Cavanaugh.
The disclosure came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts is associated with Waters' office and has released information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these false and inaccurate claims – is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online condemnation, which was also made by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is infuriated,” Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He mustn't be impudent.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of acting too furious at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee who ran to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
“Great if it’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said her office had notified "the relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities of these false claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and accountable to the law for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English – Again in Action – a soft satirical spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for Brexit subtext in every new British-themed film, which can also be applied to this continuation of the Johnny English satirical action comedy franchise – which began back in 2003 with the realization of “Johnny English” and came back to life with “Johnny English”.
Will the ironic autosatisfaction about what we are obviously garbage be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the gloomy, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber-faced face has been given a new opportunity to mess things up – with his name more than anything suggesting that it is a general comic creation designed for territories whose cinema audience is not native to English.
It is, of course, about a cunning secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to the highest glamour, carries a little Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and a crumb of the guy who played only one note in the thematic melody of the achievements “Chariots of Fire” at the London Opening Ceremony in 2012.
It was also originally based on a traveler and a mysterious man in an international setting that Atkinson once starred in now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
In this latest sequel to Johnny English, there are also several scenes worth mentioning.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly buzzed at his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather lukewarm and unusually superficial, especially given that "serious" film brands, such as "007" and "Mission Impossible", now regularly include comic elements as well.
Humor seems to be intended for children, not adults, and, to me, Johnny English's freak accidents are not as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's silent-film-style gags when he interpreted Bean.
It is now a very topical topic that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cybernetic hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of an agent on duty – unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and combative character, who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to the fall of political popularity: Emma Thompson masterfully played this character modeled after Theresa May, but the script is rather poor.
Intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised and that she will have to hire one of the retired.
It's the head-and-bearded Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but unofficially teaches lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English provides an academy for spying in the spirit of the movie "The School of Rock".
English urgently returns to Whitehall for instructions and reunites with a former patient assistant, Bau, re-interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bau is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, in the interpretation of Vicky Pepperdine which is somewhat superfluous.
And so the foolish and incompetent Batman and Robin are back in action in Her Majesty's secret service and meet the beautiful femme fatale Olga Kurilenko, Ofelia Buletov.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of comic adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a sparkling French restaurant, create chaos by smuggling into Walt's luxury yacht, and English stirs real anarchy by trying to get acquainted with the interior of Walt's house using virtual reality headphones.
Obviously, a great deal of effort has been put into that last sequence, but as cute and cheerful as it may be, the whole film feels like it was made for children.
Pretty average quality.
As with other Johnny English films, I cannot help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with any role for Rowan Atkinson that would justify his talent?
Labour denies making a plan for Britons to work four days a week and be paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan under which Britons will work four days a week – and be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to shift the time they save to workers thanks to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them an extra day off.
Employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend – but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would “fit” into the party’s economic program and plans to improve working conditions and workers’ rights.
The move to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the volatile economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: "It is expected that a review of the census will be announced by the end of the year.
"The change won't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits in with the approach of the battalion to re-launch the industry's grip on the workforce, the worker, the worker, the worker."
The Labour Party is not the first to adopt such an idea, the Green Party has complained about the four-year working week of such a campaign for the general election in 2017.
However, such a quest is not currently shared by the entire Labor Party's battalion.
The Labour Party's Portparlament says: "The four-year working week was not part of the party's program, and the party does not consider it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell has used the last-ditch conference of the Labour Party to expose his vision of the socialist revolution at the time of the event.
Mr. McDonnell reiterated his determination to regain power from "unlike directors" and "profiters" in public undertakings.
The shadow minister's office also agrees that the current water-guarding companies' water-managers may not be able to obtain their entire share of the shares, because the Labour Party would not be able to do so.
He also confirmed the plans for the transfer of 500 workers to the administrative offices of the company and the creation of the Inclusive Ownership Funds, through which 10 workers would be transferred to the capital of the company, and 10 workers would be transferred to the capital of the company.
Lyndsey Graham and John Kennedy are speaking on "60 Minutes" to see if they could change their minds over the FBI investigation into the Cavanaugh case.
An FBI investigation into a charge on the basis of an indictment against Judge Bret Cavanaugh, and it's been the least of a week of a final vote on his name's indictment on the article.
In the interlude of Sunday's broadcast, reporter Scott Palley asked Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if they'd be able to get the FBI to do something about it.
Kennedy was open to his colleagues in South Carolina, and he's not.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said, going to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when the indictment came forward, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, he was determined, he was meaningless."
However, it seems that Graham's voice is encased in a rock.
"I have made my decision on Bret Cavanaugh and would not change it with the most explosive of charges," he said.
"I don't know what it was about Dr. Ford, but here's what I do know: Brett rejected everything," Graham added, thinking of Christine Blasey Ford.
“And no one that she has mentioned can confirm that. . .
That's 36 years ago.
I wouldn't say there's anything new going on."
What is the festival “Global Citizen” and has it ever contributed to the reduction of poverty?
THIS SATURDAY NEW YORK IS GONNA HOME TO THE GLOBAL CITIZENS FESTIVAL, A YEARLY MUSIC EVENT WITH A LONG AND IMPRESSIVE LIST OF PERFORMERS AND NOTHING MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THE IMPRESSIVE MISSION
The seventh festival, the Global Citizen's Day, and the grand grass-land, the Central Park, will be visited by dozens of thousands of people, and they won't be the only ones to enjoy the performances of the spy.
Festival of Global Citizens, which was held for the first time in 2012, presents the continuation of the Project of Exploitation of Global Raw Materials, an international group of philanthropists and philanthropists.
In order to receive a free ticket for an event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to do a series of works, namely, an “action” by way of volunteering, or by way of volunteering.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been, having in mind the 12 years left to achieve the goal? I don't know.
Is the idea of building a free-of-charge concerto the right way for people to get involved in demanding a call to action, or is the idea of building a free-of-charge concerto the right way for people to get involved in demanding a call to action, or is it just one more case of a so-called "click" in question?
Organizers of Global Citizens claim that since 2011 they have neglected more than 19 million actions of their supporters aimed at achieving a number of different goals.
They claim that by 2030, these actions have helped world leaders to make announcements about their goals and project the value of over 37 billion dollars that would affect the lives of 25 million people in the future.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had set 390 set goals and announced proceeds from its shares, for which at least 10 billion dollars had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected so far have directly affected over 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key programs also include Programs of the Fourth Amendment, Programs of the Fourth Amendment, Programs of the Fourth Amendment, Partnership of Investors and Executors conspiring in the UK in order to "incite children to emerge in their full potential"
"With the support of the government of the UK, the donors, the national governments and the civilized world in the same way as you, the social injustice in the form of non-feeding can also be transformed into a state of affairs.
The group has also suggested that, after more than 5,000 actions, the United Kingdom has also been called upon to improve the intake of mothers and children. The government has also announced that it has taken more than 5,000 actions to improve the intake of mothers and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on his website, which reads, "Why do you think we can't eradicate extreme poverty?"
He said: “It will be a long and difficult journey, and there will be failure and failure on its part.
But as great human rights have been upheld before us, and as they have managed to move against the Apartheids, we will succeed, and we will, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mandez, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae are some of the performers who are performing at this year's New York City event, where they're going to be.
The U.S. could use the Navy to block Russian energy exports, the interior minister said in a statement. . . .
Washington may also "need" to rely on its own navy in order to make it possible for Russian energetics to reach certain markets, including the Middle East, the U.S. and the U.S., and the U.S., and the U.S., and the U.S., and the U.S., and the U.S., and the U.S., and the U.S., and the U.
Zinki insisted that Russia was engaged in Syria – where, in particular, it was more interested in calling for legitimacy – a mask for exploring new energy markets.
“I think that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to make a sale of their energies, just as they do in Eastern Europe, in the south of Europe, in the south of Europe, and in the south of Europe.”
And, according to this official, there are ways and means in which it can be prevented from happening.
"The United States has the power, with the help of our navy, to secure the opening of the sea lanes, and after that, it will also be used to block them, if it is possible to block them," he said.
Zinki addressed the audience at an event in the organization of the Council of Transporters of Energy, an unprofitable group that calls itself the "voice of the Transporter of Energy".
He further compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, arguing that they are essentially the same.
"The ECONOMIC OPTION for Iran and Russia is, less or less, exploitation and the exchange of energy," he said, saying about Russia that he was "a man who knows about three things."
These statements were made at a time when the Trump administration was attempting to retrieve from its liquefied natural gas in Europe. He was replacing Russia with Russia, which he had been trying to retrieve.
In order to achieve this goal, officials from the Trump administration, including the US President, Donald Trump, have been attempting to "infiltrate" Germany in the first place, and the United States has been attempting to "infiltrate" the United States.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, needs to be built to double the capacity of the country's 110-millimeter-dollar nuclear power plant. It's the only gas station in the world.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce resistance to this project is one thing that is simply outweighed by economic disruption and serves as an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that the Russian government's energy is to be used as a means of executing pressure, and that the shippers should have the power to elect the government," he said.
The state of the United States has provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to this project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the U.S. not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and the EU’s energy policy and the EU’s energy policy.
“I am very much hindered by the interference of third-country nationals in our energy management,” said Dieter Kempf, the president of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) in a press release.
Elizabeth Warren will "think well" about her 2020 presidential candidacy, Massachusetts senator says, according to the Washington Post.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think well" about running for president after electing a half-mandat candidate for the presidency.
At a meeting with the city administration in Holloc, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and get our dysfunctional government in the middle, and that includes a woman on top,” she said, according to the Hill newspaper.
"November 6th, I'm going to think about running for president."
It was during this meeting with the city administration that President Donald Trump criticized Trump, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Now, it's open to the critics of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Bret Cavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote: "We certainly need to investigate the FBI before we can vote on it."[13]
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that even in her own constituency, the majority of the voters did not consider that Warren's 2020 should be the date of the election of the majority of voters.
A decade ago, I heard from a number of "credible" voters in Massachusetts saying that the senator shouldn't be running for office, and that the polls that were filed by the U.S.
Thirty-two grades supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Devalo Patric, with 38 percent support for the presidential nomination and 48 percent voters voting against it.
Other sounding names from the ranks of Democrats who have been mentioned in connection with a possible 2020 Candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden, and the Senate, who is currently in office.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, handed over to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic stress shift of Trace Palin at a rally by Donald Trump.
Trac Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
On Monday night, he was brought in and charged with an incident of violence in his family. I'm sorry.
"It's through what my son is going through, it's through what he's going through after a relapse, I can understand other families that are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and it's through what he's going through, and it's through what he's going through, and it's through what he's going through, and it's through what he's going through, and it's through what he's been through.
Palin's story is about him, and he's also describing his story as an example of a big problem that everyone ignores, and he's saying about his son and other war veterans, "they're coming back to the other guy.
He's been arrested on a Monday in Vassilis in Alaska, and charged with family-based violence on the occasion of an assault on a woman, and he's been arrested for reporting family-based violence, and he's been charged with murder.
Eighteen federal states and the District of Columbia have maintained a review of the new regulations on the provision of asylum.
A number of federal states and the District of Columbia have maintained a proper review of a new U.S. census that foresees the refusal to grant asylum to victims who are on the run.
Representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia handed in a filing in Washington on Friday via a “court friend” as an expression of support for an asylum seeker who wants to oppose the transcript.
There's a lot of complaints filed by the complainant at the Grace Anti-Counterfeiting Office, a secret that the American Civil Liberties Union has not uncovered against a sworn census.
She said her partner "and his sons, gang members" were abusive, but U.S. officials refused her asylum request on June 20.
She's being held in Texas.
The state attorneys who provide legal support to Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, the countries from which a large number of asylum seekers are arriving in the United States, as well as the U.S.
The new U.S. asylum order is an invalidation of a 2014 decision made by the U.S. Immigrant Refugee Board, which is an undocumented immigrant who is on the run from the U.S. to the U.S.
The supreme defender in the District of Columbia, Carl Racine, said on Friday that the new transcript "ignored decades of the state's, its, its, its, its, its, its, its, its, its, its, its, its, its, its, its, its, its."
The “Constitutional Law” requires that all decisions on all asylum requests be made on the basis of particular facts and circumstances, as stated in the “request”, and thus the “principle” of the
The detainees further ordered in the document that the census by which the immigrants were deprived of entry to damage the U.S. economy, saying that they were more likely to become entrepreneurs.
Chief Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June that they no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing from infancy and domestic violence. I'm sorry.
"Asylum is accessible to those who leave their group's homeland due to a motive or fear of a motive on the basis of race, religion, nationality, belonging to a family, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion, religion.

Desperate rescue attempts are underway in Palo Alto, and the death toll is doubling as the race to rescue the survivors continues.
The survivors were faced with an increasingly awful situation.
"It's very uphill," says 35-year-old mother Reese Kusuma, as she soothes her baby boy who is crying in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“An ambulance is bringing the bodies in every minute.
There's not enough clean water."
They've been seen by residents returning to their destroyed homes, re-examined for evidence, and trying to save everything they can to get away with it.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who had suffered a fracture of his spine and shoulder, were lying in front of a military hospital in Palu, where the patients were confined to a third-grader hospital in the city of Palu.
Eyes full of tears tells how he felt as the earthquake violently shakes the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“It was not the time to be saved.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city to celebrate the wedding.
“I heard my wife help me, and then I heard silence.
I don't know what was going on with her and my kid.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Abusing Propaganda Advertisements”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily, highlighting the sharpened uses of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. Embassy in Washington, D.C.
U.S. President Donald Trump's 6th U.S. presidential address mentioned last Wednesday the China Daily's paid allowance to the DeMoyne Registry - the most handed-over list in the state of Iowa - the U.S. state of Iowa - the U.S. state of Iowa.
Trump's allegations that Beijing attempted to interfere in the U.S. election are based on what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new phase in the U.S. military's Washington campaign.
While it's normal for governments to publish commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in the midst of an escalating trade war in the midst of an escalating trade war in the midst of an encirclement.
The goal of China’s tariffs in the early phase of the trade war was to strike Iowa-like proxies from the state, which maintain Trump’s Republican party, the SDA said.
Terry Brunstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said he also said Beijing had damaged the country's economy.
As Brunstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the DiMoyne Registry, China "is now additionally announcing to us the promulgation of propaganda admonitions in our own society."
"By spreading its message, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, publishing a paid ad in Dimoj. The press release reads:"
"On the other side, at a newsstand on the street in Beijing, you'll find a little bit of opposing voices, and you won't see any real representation of opposing thoughts. " ---->>>
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused an offer to publish" his article, but did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating themselves from women's voters in front of an election to a half-mandat because of the devil with Judge Cavanaugh.
Whilst many of the Republican Party's top officials have been holding and defending a candidate for a member of the Supreme Court, Bret Cavanaugh, who is facing multiple sex-related charges in the United States, the United States, and the United States, the United States, and the United States, the United States, and the United States, the United States, and the United States.
The emotion associated with this situation is exceptionally significant, and for most Republicans, they already know they want to give him their voices.
Such things are impossible to carry out," said Grant Richer, professor of political science at the Maxwell faculty at the University of Syracuse, in an article published in the Hiltuan newspaper.
Richer has raised suspicions that insisting that Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) investigate the FBI in the last minute will be enough to soothe the acrimonious voices.
"Women will not forget what happened last night -- they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and head of state, in a statement on Friday.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "New York is Coming!" while they were in the Senate House of Representatives, despite the fact that they were Republicans, who were controlling the Judicial Court of the United States.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach an unforeseen level,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political activist on the news site.
“People say it’s already at a high level, that’s right.
But they can continue to grow, often among indecisive female voters from the suburbs and younger voters from the ages of 18 to 29, who often do not vote. "
Even before the public testimony in which Fordo's public testimony was written in detail, the report on sexual misconduct by the party of the candidate for the position of a member of the Supreme Court of Justice, was filed by the Supreme Court of Justice.
“This has turned into a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News last week.
"It's not just about the vote of an ombudsman or a final vote, or whether it's going to end up in court, it's also about the manner in which the Republicans came to be here, and it's not just about the vote of an ombudsman or the final vote.
However, it seems that the Americans have come to be divided on the question of who they believe in following the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, with a few more of those who are with the latter.
A new poll that was filed by the South Gov's agency shows that 41 of the respondents definitively or credibly believe in the Fed's testimony, while 35 of them say they believe in the Fed's testimony.
Along with that, 38 of them said they thought Cavanaugh was likely or definitively lying in his testimony, while only 30 of them thought the same thing about Fordo.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.

The Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Launch a New Web to Counteract Google and Facebook. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup project whose goal is to become a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The newest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open booth at the Solide code. It's called "Inrupt".
A solid user base makes it possible for them to choose where their data will be stored and how they can access the information they hold onto it.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that he was the intent behind the Inrupt project's "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said for the startup.
“This is an historic moment.”
The application uses the Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal space for online data storage", or POD, for example.
It may contain mailing lists, job lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all simultaneously available in a single browser.
What is unique to the personal space for the online storage of data is that it is solely up to the user who is able to access the information that he or she holds.
The company calls it "personally based on data-driven insights."
The idea behind the Insurrection, as Director-General John Bruce says, is for the company to provide the resources, the process, and the responsiveness of the arts to do all the work it can to help the world.
The company is currently meeting from Berners-Lee, Bruce, a secure platform purchased from IBC, a few of the permanent programs of engagements, and a few of the most important ones.
Starting this week, software developers around the world may be able to make self-deciphered applications with the help of tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they will introduce a complete change to the law that will affect all of their affairs in the future.
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In an announcement on Saturday at the Media PLATFORM, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "has a mission to provide commensurate energy and an exoplanet that will also help to keep him alive."
Berners-Lee was the founder of the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been one of the influential voices in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even if he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about looking at this new era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Honoring the Priest of the First World War, the bearer of the Victorian Cross
The only priest of the Church of England to whom the Victoria Cross has been assigned as a fighter during the First World War, is honored in his native city 100 years after the First World War.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Van served in this decoration on September 29, 1918, on the occasion of the invasions of Belangles and Leocourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, and he never knew he had been awarded the highest British military distinction.
His two grandchildren uncovered a metal plate on Saturday in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plate had been uncovered exactly 100 years after the advancement that his grandfather had been doing for his life.
On September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van told his battalion through the channel that Saint-Quentin was "through a very thick fog, and underneath a very thick fog."
Then he rushed to the line of fire and with “the greatest youthfulness” led the attack before he independently attacked the artillery guns and threw the gun out of the machine-gun three times.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I would never be able to do, but something that causes a lot of respect.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also created a wreath in the wake of an operation led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra in Brentwood.
Michael Vaughan said he "remembers a lot of honor because he participated in the show," and added that "the unveiling of the true hero was a demon-structured human being."
MMA devotees stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead got Pepa Press.
Imagine if you were to stay awake all night to watch the White House 206, and if you were to be unable to watch the main event, you'd be able to stay awake all night.
The event at San Jose involved 13 fights, including six in the main event, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK overnight.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gagard Musashi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, spectators in the U.K. were left unaware when the transfer was made to Pep.
Some of them were disappointed in the way they stayed awake until the next morning because of this fight.
One admirer described a child's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke."[13][13][13][13]
"As per the state census, the contents at 6 a.m. were not attached, so they had to pass it on to the children's census," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the
"'Peppa Prase', yes."
Company president Bellator Scott Cocker has said he's going to work on his pre-Greece scheme to incorporate future UK audiences.
"I think, as far as the rerun is concerned, I think we'll probably be able to do that," Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to do that until a week after our time, a Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to sort it out, we thought it was a matter of technical inconvenience.
But it wasn't. The problem was the state.
I can promise you, it won't happen next time. It's okay.
We’ll stick to the fifth fight instead of six – as we usually do – we’ve tried to make it more fun to provide more of the usual and one-of-a-kind thing we’ve done.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels "Inferior" About Sexuality.
Olympic scuba divers Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority in relation to another because of his sexuality — but that’s what motivated him to succeed.
This 24-year-old says that up until the seniors of the founding school did not realize that "not everyone is like him".
In an interview on Radio 4 in the first issue of the television show Desert Island Discs with the conductor Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights in order to "give it to others".
He also said that he has been less concerned about winning the Olympics since he became a native.
The traditional host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took it away for a few months due to illness.
Giving the impression of a rejected person on LaVerne's first airing, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than the others as long as he was distracted by the fact that "he was social.
He said, "Until today, this feeling is that I am less valuable and that I am different, these were the real things that gave me the power and the ability to succeed."
He wanted to prove that there was "something and something," he said, in order not to disappoint everything when it came to his sexuality at the end of the day.
A two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics has become an outspoken fighter for LGBTQ rights and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Austria. He has also used his performance at the Olympic Games in Austria.
He says he negotiated because he felt lucky to be able to live openly, without a trace, and because he wanted others to "hope."
The three-time world champion says he "surprised" his fall in love with a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley got married last year to an Oscar-winner 20 years older than him, but he says that the difference in years hasn't been a problem at all. I'm sure.
“When you pass through so much of it at such an early age” – at the first Olympics he left at 14 years old, and his father died from the river three years later – he said that he was still alive.
The two became parents in June, adopted Robert Ray Black-Day's son, and Daley says that he's "readable perspective" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been just ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
Robbie is my gold medalist at the Olympics."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was discovered to have a brain cancer.
Daley says that his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of his last questions was whether they already had the cards for the Olympics – he was in London in 2012 and that he was in London for the first time.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t live to be in the first place,’” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and until when he stopped breathing and when he died, I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed about all my life – that there was no better feeling in front of the home crowd at the Olympics. . . .
This feeling also inspired his selection of the first song “Proud” by Heather Smol, which he had been resonating with in preparations for the Olympics and from which he was and continues to be.
The Desert Island show is being debated on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British summer time.
Mikkelson, due to the fallout from the form, was put on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil McKelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he'll be forced to re-enter the form to avoid the opportunity to do so.
Michaelson, who is taking part in this two-year event for the record-breaking 12th time, Captain Jim Furyck sent to the bench for Saturday's games with four balls and games in between.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he was so often in the United States, the five-time champion will, in part, lead the game as a cheerleader, and in part, as a leader.
Since at the height of his career he wasn't the most specific in distant donations, this 48-year-old is not the ideal candidate for the narrow terrain of "Le Golfe National", a high-profile golf course.
And if I'm not alone in the field, I'm not sufficiently disappointed, Mikkelson is in the ninth match of the week he's facing champion Brittish at the French Molinare Open.
If the U.S., whose four-times-remains-complete-dozen-matches-have a hard start, Mikkelson's sword could absolutely be judged.
Furik insisted that he had confidence in his man, though he couldn't say anything much differently.
“He fully understood the role he played today, he patted me on the back, he hugged me, and he said he was going to be ready tomorrow,” Fourik said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
His name's in the Hall of Fame, and that's how much he's contributed to these teams in the past, and so it's been this week.
I probably didn't plan on him playing the two-sword game.
I planned more, but that's how it turned out, and that's the way we decided we should go.
He wanted to be there, as much as anyone else."
Mikkelson will beat Nick Fuldo's record for the most matches of the week in the Ryder Cup.
That could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that just never made it to the height of his personal record. I don't know.
Mikkelson had 18 wins, 20 draws, and seven draws, but Fourik said his absence felt bad on the team.
“He’s amused, sarcastic, funny, likes to joke with people and it’s great to have him in the teamroom,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed the opportunity to tease him, and this week, which was amusing to watch.
It's a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Tomas Bjorn knows that the greatness is about to be overwhelmed.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a significant preponderance is on the eve of the last day of the Ryder Cup's single-player matches, so it's easy to get back to the mainland.
The tax was made in 1997 in a match at Walderama, where the party he led to Seve Ballesteros had a preponderance of five to five over the U.S., but it's not the same as the U.S.
"I'm constantly reminded of the 10th and 6th of 2018 when we had a great deal of leverage on Valderry; we had a great deal of leverage on Brooklyn, where we lost, and on Valderry, where we won, we had a lot of leverage.
So, the story will show me and everyone on this team that there's no end to it.
Tomorrow, we're going full steam.
Let's get out there and do everything the way it's supposed to.
Nothing's ready until you've got some money on the table.
We have a goal, and it's to try and win this trophy, and that's where the focus will be.
I keep saying this, I’m focusing on 12 players from our side, but also on how we’re consciously standing up to the other side – the best players in the world.”
Delighted with his players playing on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never run in front of an ore as far as that is concerned.
Tomorrow, it's something completely different.
The next day, the individual effect comes to expression, and that demands a different game.
It's nice to be there with a partner when things are going to turn out the way they should, but when you're there alone, then your full golf capacitor is in the exam.
It's a message you have to pass on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're keeping your partner behind you, and he just as much has to get out and get everything out of him."
In contrast to Bjorn, rival team captain Jim Furyck will be looking at his players for a better one-off performance than the one they've done with the partner, with the exception of the three-parter.
And Furik himself was on both sides of those big turns of the day, first as part of the winning team in Brooklyn, and then as a loser when the European team did the "Miracle"
"I remember literally every word," he responded to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, a captain from 1999, raised the moral with his players while they were getting ready to go.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but it would be good to have a quick start like the one you saw in Brooklyn and the one you saw in Medina.
When that union moves into one of the lawns, a lot of pressure is exerted on the midfielder's sword.
That's why we're doing our job, and we're getting the boys out the way we think we should, you know, try to do a little magic tomorrow."
Tomas was given the pretext to try to lead the counter-attack and face Rory McIlroy in the final match, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, and John Royce, and Paul Casey and Justin Rose.
“I started with this group of guys in that job because I think that’s how we’re going to cover everything up to the end,” Bjorn said, pointing out his selection for the Sword of Unity.
A new respite for the new German warships.
The newest battalion of the German Navy was supposed to enter service in 2014 in order to replace the old warships from the time of the Cold War, but the new battalion of the new battalion of the German Navy, the new battalion of the German Navy, the new battalion of the German Navy, the new battalion of the German Navy, the new battalion of the German Navy, the new battalion of the German Navy.
It's going to be Rhineland-Palatinate, leading the ship of the new frigate class Baden-Wurttemberg. Now it's due to go into the first half of 2019. It's going to be the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems of the ship's postponement proved the future of this ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, commissioned by the Navy in 2007 to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that a powerful squad, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, will be inherited, as well as a certain style of technology, such as a small-scale radar, a small-scale radar, a small-scale radar.
Other important characteristics include longer periods of operation without maintenance – they should be able to conduct the newest frigates up to two years in the course of the flotilla’s life. The newest frigates should be able to conduct their work for up to two years.
However, the constant reluctance to do so means that these most modern warships – which was supposed to enable Germany to project its might onto the sea – will be in place for the rest of the world.
The unfortunate F125 frigate landed in a news report the previous year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the ship in order to return it to the ship.
It was the first time a ship had returned a Mornari to the shipyard after it had been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have ordered more crucial "defects on the software and the hardware" that would have made this warship a successor to the United States Navy's warships.
Software deficiencies were of paramount importance, as they would sail the class of Baden-Wurttemberg operated a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the number of men and women in the fleet.
Also, it turned out that the weight of the ship was drastically diverted, which would reduce its performanence and limit the Mornari's potential to reach him later on in the day.
It is thought that the Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons twice as much as the ships of the same class that the Germans used in the Second World War.
In the face of a phallic hardware, the price of a whole project – including the training of the staff – also began to pose a problem.
They say that it has reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – out of the last 2.2 billion euros.
Problems with the most recent frigate are often coming to the fore in the light of recent warnings about the declining of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Burtells, the chief of defense of the German parliament, confirmed that the Marines had just "concluded the service of the ships of the world."
This official insisted that the problem was getting more and more serious with the passage of time, because the ships were dismantled without the introduction of swap ships.
He expressed regrets that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to join the Mornarica.
NATIONAL FUND LISTENS TO THE SECRET LIFE OF BLIND MOUSES
The new investigation, which is based on one property in Scottish Highlands, aims to uncover how blind mice are using geographic features of the terrain in search of food, and how they can be found.
Researchers are hoping that they will be able to throw new lights at the behavior of these unique flying mammals and assist in directing future activities for the sake of their safety. ---->>>
The research of scientists from the National Foundation for Scotland will follow the usual and dwarfed blind muscles, as well as the brown long-eared lilies and the evenings in Inverness.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in a wide range of properties in order to track the activity of the blind mice during this season. . . .
The staff and volunteers of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) will also carry out a number of hand-held interrogations of the detectives.
An expert sound analysis from all the recordings will determine the frequency of the voices of the blind mice and what kind of things they do.
Then a detailed map of the station will be prepared with a report in order to obtain a picture of their behavior in the area's affairs.
Rob Duarte, conservation adviser to the Foundation, hopes to be able to discover which areas of the station are most important for the blind mice and the ways in which they are made to be found.
This information will contribute to the determination of the importance of the arrangement of the habitat through the creation of the meadow, as well as the way in which the best way to do it can be to direct us to the forests.
The number of blind mice in Scotland and the wider UK has declined markedly in the last century.
They are being stripped of construction and development works that affect nesting and loss of housing.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, as well as adhesive tracks for flies and some types of chemical treatments of building materials for homes and homes.
Blind mice are not actually blind mice.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They're relying on a sophisticated technique of echo-locating to determine the exact position of the insects and the obstacles on the flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is charged with the care of over 270 buildings of historical significance, 38 important strongholds and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about this.
The foundation has a dozen trained professionals who have been doing research for a while, checking the nesting ground, and, later, savings actions.
This organization has even made the first and only dedicated reservation for blind mice in Scotland, on the property of Trev in Dumfries County and Galloway County, which is home to the eight-year-old Dumfries County.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says that this property is the ideal territory for them to be in.
"Here in Treeve, we have a dedicated space for blind mice," she says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good station in the whole.
But a lot of that about the blind mice is still unknown, so we'll be working here and on other people to help them better understand what they need to know." We need to be able to do that.
He emphasized the importance of the inspection of the presence of the blind mice before the execution of the work on the maintenance of the property, because the accidental destruction of one of the nesting sites was the result of the destruction of the nesting site.
The bats are protected and it is against the law to kill them, multiply or harass them and destroy their nesting grounds.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Protection Fund, encourages the public to include her contribution as well. - What?
She says, "And it still takes a lot to learn about our blind mice, and for many of our species, we still don't know how the numbers are."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against a German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to talk to themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are pressing charges against the German magazine The Spiegel, which published you in the lead-up to the case.
The attacker of Juventus and Portugal is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then paid her $375,000 so she wouldn't talk about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday. - What?
Addressing 142 million of his followers at Instagram Live in a video following the announcement of the charges, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
That's what they said today, fake news," the five-time Golden Ball fighter said in the camera.
“I want them to speak up by using my name.
That's normal.
They want her to become famous, so she's gonna make my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is in order," the footballer added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the Spiegel over an order they described as an "unacceptable report on suspicions in the area of intimacy," the spokesman said.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the footballer would seek an "indictment of moral damage in the amount that corresponds to the severity of the offense, which is believed to be indictment of the offense."
The incident took place in June 2009 in the suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, California.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga were forced back into the player's room, where he was forced to go on a rape drive, the court said in a statement to the District Attorney's office.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knee after the lead incident, claiming that he was a "99-something-good-boy" but that he had given up because of those "one-one-somethings".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was on a voluntary basis.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police with photographs of her injuries committed in the hospital, but that she eventually accepted the extrajudicial order because she felt she was “severely hurt”.
These 34-year-olds say they now want to terminate the order because they're still traumatized by the guiding incident.
Ronaldo was in the lead-up to the raid on Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the raid, and this summer, for 100 million euros, he was transported to the United States for $100 million.
Brexit: UK "would never overlook" loss of car manufacturer's car
The UK "would never be too overwhelmed" if Brexit loses its status as a world leader in the automotive industry, according to Greg Clarke, the minister for economic affairs.
He added that he was "concerning" about what Toyota UK had said about the BBC that in the event that Britain would abandon the EU without understanding it, it would temporarily re-establish the relationship with the BBC.
"We need the understanding," Clarke said. "We need the understanding," Clarke said.
A Japanese automaker has said that standing at the border in the case of Brexit without understanding would cause the loss of jobs to be caused by the loss of jobs.
The factory in Bernaston – which produces this auris and avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that we will have a production facility in the factory if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota's factory in Barnston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BM-Ve, and Jaguar Land Rover, have been haunted by the fact that they have left the EU without a clear understanding of the operation.
B-M-Ve, for example, will say that Brexit will close its factory in Mark Meaney in Oxford for a month's time.
The main reasons for concern are the risks associated with the chain of custody in the case of the unaccounted for Brexit, according to the automakers' report.
Toyota’s production line operates on the principle of “exactly on time”, where the parts for the ordered cars arrive every 37 minutes from the receivers from the UK and the EU.
If the U.K. leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, it could come to the border for what industry officials say could lead to delays and lack of availability, and it could lead to the U.K. leaving the EU without an agreement on March 29th.
Toyota would not be able to store an investor for more than one day in its factory in Darbyshire, the company was generalized, and the production would have been stopped.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan is related to future EU dealings "precisely calibrated to avoid such checks on the border."
"We need a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth-- a fourth---
"The testimony is not just from Toyota, it's from him, and from other vendors, they say that absolutely we must be in a position to do what's right, but what's right, it's shown as right."
He couldn't say how long it would take to stop the extradition, but he cautioned that for a longer period of time, the accumulation of costs would reduce the concurrency of the factory, and he warned that he would not be able to do so.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and who is a functionary of the Union of the United States in the factory, says that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience, my experience, is very important.
The government’s spokesman said: “We have come up with a precise and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House said in a statement.
It's an important meeting of Donald Trump's office, with the deputy state attorney Rod Rosenstein. He could be "deposited for one more week" while he's still in office.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, the ties between Trump's aides and Russia's aides, and the powers that be.
The question of whether Trump is going to overthrow a supreme defense attorney or not, and thereby endangering Mallory's independence, has been the subject of an attack on yours for months now.
Earlier this month, the new york times reported that rosenstein was talking about the wearing of eavesdroppers for the recording of a conversation with trumpom and a potential 25th presidential election.
Rosenstein has rejected that injunction. I'm sorry.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, despite announcing that he was getting ready to step aside.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations at the time in New York, was announced on Thursday. - What?
Mr. Trump has said that Mr. Trump's case "wouldn't have been dismissed" by Mr. Rosenstein, but then Mr. Trump has been ordered to avoid being smuggled into the United States in order to be heard by the U.S. Attorney General's office.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Mr. Cavanaugh, further delaying the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's press office, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News Channel on Sunday night. I'm sorry.
On the question of Rosenstein, she responded: “There is still no fixed date, it could be this week, it could be another one, it could be another one, it could be another one, it could be another one.
But we'll see, and I'm always insisting that the press be timely informed."
Some reporters may be able to support this claim: Sanders has not held a press release in the White House since September 10th.
D.A. Chris Wallace was asking me why.
Sanders said: "The reporter's wish to "attract attention" was not a consequence of the reporter's wish to deny publicity, but she said: "I would not deny the reporter's wish to do so."
Then she announced that a direct contact would be strengthened between Trump and the reporter. I'm sorry.
"The president has a number of jurisdictions in which he responds to questions from any other president before him," she said, without citing the source: "Credible allegations."
And there will continue to be publicity, Sanders said, but “if the journalists have the opportunity to directly put questions to the President of the United States, that’s what was inadmissibly done.
We're working hard to do it often, and you've seen that we've done it in a lot of times over the past few weeks, and it's going to happen instead of a press release on the stamp.
Trump regularly responds to questions on the occasion of leaving the White House or when he participates in open sessions or news conferences with visiting officials. The President of the Republic of Srpska
Self-contained conferencing on the stamp is rare.
This week in New York, the president may have pointed out the reason for this, since he's gone to the press today, and he's gone to the press today, and he's gone to the press today, and he's gone to the press today, and he's gone to the press today.
Health Ministers Letters to EU Workers in the National Health Service of Scotland Leading to the Anxiety of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to the staff of the European Union, who works in the National Health Service of Scotland, in order to expose the gratitude of their country and to allow them to stay in the country.
Scottish MP Jean Freeman sent a letter at a time when she was less than six months away from the UK's departure from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering up the cost of resolving complaints about the residues of EU citizens who work in its incumbent public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “Negotiators on the UK’s exit from the EU were held all this summer, going to the expected decisions in the fall.
But the U.K. government is also working on preparations for a possible scenario without reaching the point of understanding.
I know this must be a disturbing time for all of you. I'm sorry.
That's why I now want to renew my appreciation for the contribution of every member of the family, without regard to nationality.
Our colleagues from various EU departments, and beyond, have contributed to our valuable experience and skills which are based on and promoted by the work of the public health service, for the benefit of the public health service, and for the benefit of the public health service.

CHRISTIAN ABERCROMBY IMMEDIATELY OPERATED AFTER HE SUFFERED A HEAD BURN
Lynnbacker Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie has been operated out of an emergency after he suffered a head injury on Saturday night due to the result of a 31-27 from Vanderbilt.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rhode Reed, told the re-porters that something had happened to the head injury before the halving.
“He came out of the line and it was just collapsing,” Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen in the car before they put him on a stretcher and took him in for further interrogation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been transferred to the Vanderbilt Medical Center to be operated.
Harris added that "there is still no detail on the type/seriousness of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it came to the injury.
Ambercrombie, the red jersey of the second year, is currently in the first season with Tennessee State after the Illinois tranfer.
On Saturday, he had five knockouts before he left the game, which puts his total number of knockouts in the season down to 18.
The cost to the buyers will be increased by the amount of taxed real estate on the occasion of the purchase of real estate in the UK
I'm going to pay for it to my customers, because of the large amount of tax-deductible for the occasion of buying real estate in the UK, and the additional income will be used to help the homeless in the warehouse with the new plane.
This will then not neutralize the success of Corbyn's stance in attracting younger voters to the polls.
The increase in the amount of taxable damage will apply to those who don't pay for the car in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
The cost to the buyers will be higher due to the amount of taxable small amounts due to the purchase of real estate in the UK – and the additional income will be used to help the homeless, Teresa May will not be found.
This will be interpreted as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in making it possible to attract younger voters, and I'm going to make it a point to promise to provide them with accessibility, and I'm going to make it a point.
The increase in the amount of taxable damage will apply to physical and legal persons who do not pay for cross-border payments in the UK, and the additional money will be used as a contribution to the fight against terrorism.
An additional reversal – which is added to the already existing taxable amount, including and will already be introduced two years ago after the second home and the purchase of the immovable property – will be introduced two years ago.
The Trezor expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, thanks to this step.
It's estimated that 13 of London's new builds are buying non-residents of the UK, which raises prices and makes it harder for people who buy their first home to get to the mainland.
Many wealthy parts of the earth – often transients – have become “cities of the spirit” because of the large number of individual customers who spend most of the time leading out of the earth.
The new transcript comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax brackets to help the youngsters come to their first-ever meeting in the city of New York.
He accused the big construction companies of "holding the prices of immovable property high" because they were leaving the country, but they weren't using it, and he pleaded for May's premiere to drop the quotas for access.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable array of reforms, including a lease control and the end of unjust eviction.
He also wants to give his approval to the council for the construction of new homes. I'm sorry.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year, I said that I would dedicate my prime ministerial mandate to the pursuit of the British dream – to make life better for every new generation.
And that's what I mean by solving the problems in our housing market, too. What's going on?
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build their lives here. I'm sorry.
However, it may not be conclusive that the purchase of immovable property will be easy for individuals who do not live in the UK and the country of the company as much as it is for the good of the British building.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, while the degradation of homelessness has become too real."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.”
Sanderland's chief, Jack Ross, says it's his "land of ambition" to, at some point, become the Scottish Representation's manager.
Forty-two-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of a revival of the Northeast club which is currently in third place in the Premier League, three points from the top.
This summer, he moved to the Lighthouse Stadium after St. Mary's returned to the Scottish Premier League last season's Premier League.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was on the B-team re-run and that's it," Ross told the Scottish BBC's SportSound show.
"But I grew up watching Scotland often on Hampden with my father when I was little, and that was something I'd always been coming back to.
However, such an opportunity would only come if I succeeded in running the club."
Ross' preschools as Sanderland's managers include Dick Advocate, David Mojiz, Sam Alderdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gass Poyet, and Paul.
The former head of Aloa Athletics said he wasn't afraid to come up with such big names at such a big club after he turned down bids from Burnsley and Ipswich.
“The measure of success at this point will be ‘whether I will be able to bring this club back to the Premier League.’
Due to the structure and capabilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get him there yet, but I think I’ll be able to see myself succeed only if I can get the club back to where it belongs.”
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, after a period that he translated as an assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15 months that he was transferred to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Then he helped Alois recover from his fall into the Third Division, and St. Mirren was brought from the edge of the fall into the lower league to the winner of the championship in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton's academy.
"It must have been a true crossroads," he said, recalling the takeover of the Alois Club.
“I really believed that the manager was doing the right thing for me, more of the gameplay.
Sounds weird because I wasn't a bad guy, I made a lot of money from it, and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing games can be tough, you know?
He's got a lot of stuff to do through which you'll have to go on a weekly basis.
And I'm still going through it in terms of stress and job pressures, but the management just keeps telling me this one thing.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, in all my grown-up life, I haven't felt more comfortable with him now."

Temporary opportunities and the impact of major social and sporting events are still the main factors when it comes to selling on the market outside the home.
It is not surprising that the groups in the restaurant are putting up a tough fight, even if at the time of the sale of 4.8, compared to the annual figure, it will be usually painful with the already present guests.

Each of the five children has a secret message on social media that he's been hiding from his parents.
Each of the five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – has a secret message on social networks that he hides from his parents and educators, reveals the research he has been doing.
Research that has sparked more than 20,000 high school students of the founding school has found a gap in the number of “false Insta” pages.
These news have intensified the fear of the publication of sexual contents.
TWENTY-FOURTH OF THE SCHOOL SAID HE HAD A "MAIN" ORDER TO INDICATE PARENTS
Each of the five children – some of whom are less than 11 years old – is responsible for the social networks he hides from the grown-ups.
Research that involved 20,000 senior students from the primary school has revealed a sudden surge in “false institutions” of the law – which has been relayed to the website for the purpose of creating a new website.
This news has intensified the fear of the publication of sexual contents.
Twenty-two years later, the school said it possessed a clean "main" order, which is shown by the parents, but they also have a pleasant order.
One mother who ran into the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl who she calls others by the words "rape me."
Investigations conducted by the UK’s Digital Awareness Organization and the Confederation of Directors and Directorates (CMC) of Independent Schools have revealed that there have been 40 cases since the beginning of the 1990s.
HMC President Mike Buchanan says: "It will be annoying to see so many teenagers coming in tempted to do so."[13] The school's internal space and the school's native space are also being used as a means of communication.
Aylee Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” at the Scottish Athletic Committee.
Aylee Doyle has been elected a member of the Scottish Athletic Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of that governing body.
Doyle is Scottish athletics' most valuable asset. And presiding Ian Beatty described this trip as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the country and gain access to the land from the Scottish athletics' assets.
"Aylie enjoys a great deal of respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are sure that the athletic community in Scotland will have enormous uses from her membership," the article reads.
Doyle said: "I want to be an athlete's voice and I hope to be really able to contribute and help lead the squad in Scotland."

I'm talking about a milk pump in which the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers.
The company that manufactures pumps for the purpose of extortion has divided the opinion of the Internet with the statement that it is more likely to harm the cows of the muses.
In order to defuse the launch of a firing spur, which he described as "the first inaudible firing spur pump to be worn from underneath the chest," the source of the firing spur was a firing spur.
Four real mothers dance in the shade between the shadows and the cows with a song whose text says: “Yes, I am a musician, but I don’t have a tail” and “Maybe you didn’t notice, but that’s not my name.”
“Pump, pump, I feed my babies, pump, pump, I muse myself,” said Refren.
However, the ads posted on the company's Facebook page caused an online counter-terrorism.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of commodities, the video sparked a variety of glacier reactions, while many have said it diminishes the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“The use of blood to advertise this product has been a very bad decision to make. . . .
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and go to produce milk, but with them all of their babies will be gone for some time after the birth," he wrote.
The pump for Elvie's extortion discreetly stands in the breastplate for breastfeeding (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why wouldn't they use it to advertise a pump for the mothers who can keep their babies?"
Somebody added, "That's an unthinkable ad."
Others stood on the sidelines of the story, and one woman admitted that her song was "urnebean".
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I'd like to do this if I were still breastfeeding.
You know, pumping makes me feel like you're in a bloody state.
She said it was a little crazy, but I just figured it out the right way.
"This is a brilliant product," he wrote, "and it's a great idea."
Someone else commented: “This ridiculous ad is aimed at moms who are milking (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and they feel ‘everything’ about it.
"This is not a word that the dairy industry has taken or gone to."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced with discreet pumps hidden in their breasts.
The premise of the sentence is based on the knowledge that many of the mothers who are milking her milk say they feel like they're going to be cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, there's no wire or tubes, and she's standing in the breastplate for nursing, giving the woman the freedom to move, holding her baby out, even out.
Anna Ballarin, a partner and executive creative director at the Mother company, commented: “Pump Elvie is so much a revolutionary product that it serves the cause and the cause of life.
By drawing a parallel between the female and the lactating cows, we wanted to highlight the youthfulness and the challenges it brings with it, as well as to present the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides in a way that is fun and with which women can connect.
This is not the first time Elvie Pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Moved to Temporary Camp on Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies to make it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
As a rule, the sponsors themselves were mostly illegal immigrants without documents and feared that they would jeopardize their own possibility of staying in the country if they stepped up and looked for a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, confirmed last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of underage care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who have been sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are criminally prosecuted foreigners.
That’s why we’re still chasing those people,” Albens said.
According to the refugee workers, in order to prosecute the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of within 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Most will use a conference video to apply for legal status to an immigration judge instead of being present in person.
Those who are found not to meet the conditions for release will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, according to shelter workers and reports from the system over the previous months.
Lawmakers say concerns about this are raised in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where indications that a child is being tortured can easily be overlooked due to size.
They add that moving children to a temporary settlement without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on refugees from Syria to return home, even though the war in their country has been going on for the eighth year.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said before the assembly.
Muallem said the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions have fled their homeland.
He also said Damascus would continue to “carry on its holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly trained and advised by both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Ashad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground of a war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Muallem said that there are satisfactory conditions for their return and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that keeps refugees out of the country.
“We have made an appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help their return,” he said.
“They’re making politics out of something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to place a vacuum zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created opportunities for further development of political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has diverted attention from the large-scale attack by Syrian forces that enjoy Russian support in the province of three million people.
Muallem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the target of military actions will be jihadists along with fighters from the Nusra Front, affiliated with al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition will soon be convened with the aim of drafting a post-war constitution that would allow Syria to hold elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to reviewing articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump could win a re-election in 2020 unless, as a large number of liberals probably hope, accusations and scandals end his reign before then.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final episode of a presidential career in history!”
For now, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
The peak-time viewership has more than doubled since 2014, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled from 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million on prime time, more than the 1.7 million they had four years ago, according to Nielsen, while MSNBC's "Rachel Meadow Show" ranks first on cable with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the day of the most important news.
“It’s an element that people get drawn into because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Behr, the lead producer of ABC’s “Acting” series, which talks about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the destruction of the Capitol in the attack.
Nell Scovel, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Fun Parts: And A Few Painful Truths About Hollywood Behind the Scenes, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked him why.
Miss Scovel says he replied, “Because it makes me laugh.”
Chaos also contains the value of fun.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the plots that come from Washington could determine the future of women’s right to decide on abortion, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.
Turning off programs is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, it goes a little beyond being an informed citizen when you catch yourself as you are already six hours into a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward, in his book Fear, places information as facts, on Paul Manafort’s ostrich-leather pilot jacket of $15,000, Trump’s description of this (“a piece set with pride,” as the Washington Post called it).
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“One part of his behavior that makes everything look like a reality show is that he offers us content every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the show “Pension Stars”, on the subject of changing characters and the daily plots of the plot in the Trump show.
You must not allow yourself to miss any episodes, otherwise you will fall behind.
When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, there were sunny 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and he was watching MSNBC live and CNN was filming.
He couldn’t get off the screen, not while Brett Cavanaugh faces the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
“I remember at the time, when we were doing all those crazy shows, people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” says Mr. Fleiss.
“I thought they were joking, but I guess they were right.”

The influx of foreign money in the middle of a tense race for early elections in the Presidential House
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district has been receiving inflows of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that have led to two deputies each fighting for the same seat.
That’s how Conor Lamb, a Pittsburgh suburban district Democrat, recently fell out, winning a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is in a race with another lawmaker, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were drawn again after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had unconstitutionally rigged the election results in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th launched a campaign funding competition between the largest party funders, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely followed March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the election by 20 points.
Political experts have given Trump a slight advantage.
U.S. Considers Penalizing El Salvador for Supporting China, So It Withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the penalties applied only to El Salvador, which in 2017 received US aid in an estimated amount of $140 million, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The imposed punitive measures, which include financial aid cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would hardly fall to a Central American state that already has a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings continued, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic progress to accompany a similar gathering last year that they saw as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made it clear they wanted the conference to take place and put an end to all questions about penalizing El Salvador.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence will attend the conference, the new term of which is mid-October, which indicates the importance that the administration attaches to the gathering, according to diplomats.
And so the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal issues on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, also anonymously.
Study the history
The next inevitable thing is likely to be a report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, of which there is already significant evidence in public sources.
Mueller is also reportedly launching an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in connection with the election attacks.
If Congress were to take over, Trump would face responsibility in that body, as he prepares to go before voters again, and possibly before the courts of colleagues.
That’s a lot of unconfirmed possibilities, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s defeat is inevitable – or the defeat of his equivalents in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, need to make decisions that will determine how long the difficulties will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, if the West were able to resist him and deter the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed to do so, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the massacre that ensued in the years to come.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who runs the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been caught in the crosshairs since the paper reported that it suggested last year that the president be secretly filmed and commented on his unfitness for office.
Rosenstein says the Times' statement is incorrect.
“How should we react when the newly launched investigation of Brett Kavanaugh at the BBC is neither complete nor fair, or if it gets the approval of the Supreme Court, despite reliable allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress that considers Mr. Trump trustworthy in early elections?
If we fail these exams, democracy will have a long winter ahead.
But I believe that we will not fall thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorans of the Rangers optimistic before meeting with Rapid Wien
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive tie with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, would have brought them a firm position for Group G Europa League qualification.
Graham Doran, a midfielder, due to a knee injury could not appear in the season until a 2–2 tie with Villarreal, but believes the Rangers can use that score as a stepping stone for larger goals.
“It’s a good point for us because Villarreal is in a better position,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game with the belief that we could win something, and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten them in the end, but taking everything into account, a leveled result is quite fair.
They were probably better than us in the first half, but we came back in the second and took the lead.
Thursday is approaching and it will be another great evening for Europe.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they had an excellent result from the last game. Although, with the audience on our side, I am sure that we can get a positive result.
The past year has been very difficult, with everything that has happened to me with injuries and changes in the club itself, but the current position is satisfactory.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it, the training is good.
We hope that now we can get a grip, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
Women Overwhelmed by Savings for Retirement
Despite the fact that the study participants clearly knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, very few of them discussed it with families.
About half of those surveyed in the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them say they’ve talked to children about it.
“People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationwide.
Here’s how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family for nursing if you don’t introduce them to your wishes well in advance.
Together with your counselor and family, decide where and how you want to receive care because these are choices that greatly affect costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can help you find a way to cover those expenses.
Your long-term care financial decisions may include common long-term care insurance policies, a hybrid life insurance policy that involves money and value to cover expenses, or self-insurance from your own property, as long as you have the money.
Organize your legal documentation: prevent litigation.
Get a health care assistant to have a trusted person you can entrust with taking care of your health care and ensuring that health care professionals are aware of your preferences in case you are unable to make a statement for yourself.
Also, consider granting authority to manage finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the bills are paid on time if you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent comes into a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you give answers to questions about medications and allergies?
Give these details in writing so that you are ready
“It’s not just finances that are at stake, it’s questions like who the doctors are,” Martina asks.
“What medication does he use?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan for all of this.”
Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was returning home from the exit.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in a section of Ilfracoma in Devon called Oxford Grove when he was shot in the chest, stomach and fist.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. British summer time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
Injuries are not life-threatening, and police have asked witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise, according to official sources.
Due to the cut-off, emergency assistance officials were unable to obtain information from the Dongale regency, an area north of Palu that was closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are the most important facts about Palu and Dongali on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was in the middle of a 40th anniversary celebration at the time of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongal is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, a lower-level administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the province of North Sulawesi relies heavily on fishing and livestock farming, especially in the coastal area of Dongale.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in the Morovali area, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulevasi.
Palu and Dongala have experienced multiple tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In the 1938 Dongal tsunami, more than 200 people lost their lives and thousands of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami struck western Dongal again in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies on the seismic fire belt of the Pacific and is a regular target of earthquakes.
These are the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half the population of Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people lost their lives on the island of Nias opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Zaparna Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra and triggered a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A minor-depth earthquake hit the Pidijai regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on harassment charges.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as allegations of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged offenses, he took her phone.
Palin was held in custody in Mats and was given a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and said he was "certainly not guilty" when asked, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, meaning he could face a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offense punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently in court for Alaska veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of criminal reporting, and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) caused by the war in Iraq.
Tsunami Caused by Indonesia Earthquake: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck only central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifoul Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rented truck to attack a bike lane along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October and mowed down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
According to the court document, both points carry a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed 22 indictments against Saipov, including eight counts of racketeering and murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “abhorrent, cruel and corrupt.”
"Saifulo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries and loss of life to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Laur Dicat, Deren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruccio, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Panuccio."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been 10 years since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is originally from Uzbekistan, did not repent in the days and months after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
The indictment alleges that Saipov told authorities that he was prompted to carry out the attack by ISIS videotapes on his phone.
Police said he had sought and displayed an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Péton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "apparently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty plea with life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Petton said.
Sayp’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be in Charge of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at a Conservative Party conference on Monday.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should face euroscepticism – as one of May’s MPs suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative backward MP Peter Bone told a meeting in Birmingham that the UK would have “already left” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
However, the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her divided ranks has been highlighted by the views of conservatives who are in favour of staying and joining the city’s separate anti-Brexit protest.
The prime minister is struggling to follow the Chequers compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, supporters of the remainder and the EU.
Allies insist on continuing to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction – and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its offer and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said at Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should become equal and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If I were responsible, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to reject Chequers.”
Stressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely incorrect.”
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative MP and Brexit supporter, also attended the protest and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular with our party and our activists who actually take to the streets and put us first.
Play Chequers and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their seats when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that politicians must face problems if they decide to issue a decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we’re not going to let them get away with it.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on its way to betray Brexit, to feel the coming tide.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that won the Brexit victory and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the remains strolled through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Many activists waved banners of “Conservatives Against Brexit” after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, the leader of the Labour Party, mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they had with the party’s application since the conference opened.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can deploy the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus solution, for the friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.”
“A good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider entering the race for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "well consider entering the race for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in the town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Dill, a Republican who co-chaired the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign.
It has been speculated that Warren could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Hollocau was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to rebuild a shaken government, and that includes a woman at the top.”
The suspect who shot Sims, an LSU player, has been arrested.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that they had arrested the suspect who shot and killed LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m. ET at the conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Simms, 20, was killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms was shot in the head and instantly passed away,” Murphy J. Paul, the chief of police, told the news channel 247sports.
Wade defended his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present, possessing a gun, and killing Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
With a height of 198.12 cm and growing up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average time of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team would play a big role in this race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his colleague.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to plunge into the crowd at the end of the lane, which was supposed to be decisive.
The Mercedes departed later and came out in front of Vettel, but Hamilton overtook the wheel after riding the wheel, which inadvertently left the Ferrari driver in danger of retreating after a double defensive movement on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and reached seventh place at the end of the first lap, on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race to score a quick finish and took fourth place to Kimia Raikkonen.
He went into boxing in lap 44, but could not increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen stayed in fourth place.
This is a tough day because Valteri drove great all weekend and as a true gentleman he missed me.
The team did a great job of winning the first two places,” Hamilton said.
That was bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she did not release a letter from Christine Blaze Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people are “bad, rude and dishonest.”
“The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, rude and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the posts and the leaks, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you make that public?
Remember her answer...did you release the document – “Oh, please, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we publish it... No, we didn’t,” he added, referring to the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked to the public in September. Feinstein rejected the claim that information had leaked from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish her story,” Feinstein told the board.
“She asked me to keep the story confidential and I kept it as confidential as she requested.”
But her denial did not seem to appeal to the president, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know what, that was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president said Democrats were using those accusations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to restore power by any means.
You see evil, disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control,” Mediaite said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday in a 5–3 rematch in Dundee.
The Giants took advantage of two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowlie.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought home field advantage before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lucas Landvod Nielsen's two goals secured victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe, who came to beat Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener reached 3:35 in the fourth minute with Kendall McFaul assisting, with David Rutherford securing the assist after Bowley doubled the lead four minutes later.
At the time of the busy opening, Sullivan regained the advantage of playing at home at 13:10 before Matt Marcuis assisted in a tie by Cooney at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead in the first third when giving scored a second goal at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard tied with an excellent goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran helped Nilsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and ensured their team's victory in the fifth half of the final half.
The Giants, which have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Died to Save Hundreds of People on Plane From Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after allowing a plane with hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong blows continue to shake the area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues being evacuated, 21-year-old Antonis Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower that collapsed at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the city of Palu.
He remained to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, had taken off safely.
He then jumped off the control tower when he saw the tower fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sire said the decision Antonis made may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken because of this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as the National Disaster Management Agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong was restricted.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nagroho said.
Waves that reached up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “At any moment, an ambulance brings bodies.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Ian Gelfend, director of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the state military: “I ask you to work around the clock to complete all rescue tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lamboko earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini reports one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said one person was missing after it said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it had not been able to find a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find passengers.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew as the plane crashed while attempting to land at the airport on Chuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew low.
"That's an extremely good thing," said Janes.
Janes said he and others managed to break through the water to the waist to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses panicked and shouted and he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on repairs to the docks also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters under the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in crashes of airlines registered in the PNG in the past two decades, but none of them was Air Niugini.
Analyst Shows Chronology of the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
Prosecutors ended their retrial on Saturday of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rawlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury that he used cell phone records to merge the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Roulet said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellys was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with a cell phone belonging to Chabers for the time period when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came to testify on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellys was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because the truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records show that they only knew each other for seven days.
Roulet said that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellys deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to make its final statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to continue during the day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop that raises awareness?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative image of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots – political messaging and solving social issues.
They want to return to their roots and restore the popularity of socio-political hip hop.
Artists such as Fujiz and Common have again become current in the UK thanks to performers such as Akala and Louki.
Another black person?
Nanny in New York sues couple for firing after ‘racist’ message
A nanny in New York sued a couple for discrimination and dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that the nanny was “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and equates the lawsuit with “extortion.”
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that the new babysitter, Gisele Morris, was a black woman when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEE is just another black person,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a note to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
When she realized the mistake, "disturbed" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that her current nanny, who is African-American, was not doing a good job and that she was expecting a Filipina instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid one day of work, and then Uber was invited to take her home.
Morris now sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and seeks compensation of $350 per day for the six-month job they were originally supposed to perform living in their home, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t do things like that,” she told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple dismissed the claims that they were racist and said Morris’s hiatus was a reasonable move because they feared they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t plan to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists." husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But why would you give your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, please."
Equating the lawsuit with “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the court of public opinion quickly renounced the couple on social networks and condemned them for their behavior and logic.
In a newly revealed letter, we learn that publishers of Paddington books were afraid that readers would not be tied to a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s very fun now to know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before a little teddy bear inspired him to write this children's book, would be optimistic even if his work was rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "simultaneously bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she said her father was discreetly proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man and did not boast,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, he felt like people had a child who accomplished something: they were proud of him when they didn’t actually do anything.
I think Paddington's success was more or less like that.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Ned regularly called to say that the condition is very bad, that he does not expect to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperus.
“Then I got a call from Ned telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effects of the medications given to keep her heart beating stopped slowly and the medications left her system.
She died some time before that and this was actually a shutdown of the entire system.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t moan or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to hold on.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who did not know what hell she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I bowed my head and tears dripped through my face all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but over the summer I felt immense compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning put suicide prevention cards on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide work to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys set up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with great potential and a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated the room.”
However, he quit his job before his death because “everything was dark.”
After taking his own life in 2014, he was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be consequences."
Mrs. Davis made the cards “to let people know that there are people you can contact and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you need to talk to someone.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davis's for years, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He touched the bottom on Christmas day – when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
She said his death was a major trauma for them, but that they had to deal with it: “It leads to family discord.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to keep going and fight.”

Bret Cavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we really got something similar to what he was asking for — an investigation with limited time and limited scope — maybe we could come to some kind of agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “disintegrating” amid strong party pressure.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their opposition came about because of timing.
We are only five weeks away from the midterm elections, which take place on November 6 – if, as expected, Republicans go badly, they will be significantly weakened in their attempts to bring the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been inviting the senators and lobbying them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to overturn the decision and refer him to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea "fallen" under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean deserters who have fled to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byong-seg said there were 1,127 defections last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter controls at the borders between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smuggling were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from North Korea eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross due to the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have visibly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delaying denuclearization talks.
This came after a June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without any confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security and under such conditions, there is no chance that we will unilaterally be the first to disarm,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Cavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not fit to serve in Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament made him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribunal Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but get the impression that if a woman ever behaved like that, they would call her hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when they were teenagers.
During the introductory talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling and squeezing his throat as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the commission, calling the accusations against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on personality” orchestrated by liberals angry at what Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was perceived to be biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated to give an answer when asked if he would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if he was admitted to the Supreme Court and if Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll tell you this: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he shouldn’t be in the Supreme Court, he should be in the court he’s currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh verdicts against the Affordable Care Act or the Rowe v. Wade Act because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the subsequent hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not the time for one hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say how wonderful that is,” Pelosi said.
And women should be proud of that.
It’s a justified criticism, months and years of overwhelming anger, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's a rare occurrence, is it?"
She continued, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive at a company and who said she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that implied that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to would say, ‘Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And then she would just keep going.
That sounded great to me, too.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger in part because people basically don’t understand them.
One of my strongest memories is when, in a previous job in an office that was mostly men, I once cried out of unspeakable anger and was grabbed by the neck by an older woman—a cold manager whom I was always a little afraid of—and dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They'll think you're sad and they'll be glad they hit you like that."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called "Monkey Affairs" and dropped out of the race, a deeply frustrated Miss Schroeder realized that there was no reason why she couldn't try to enter the race for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
With the campaign already advancing, she ran out of funds and vowed not to enter the race unless she could raise $2 million.
That battle was doomed.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I get a discount?” she asked.
When she gave a speech in which she said she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration at a system that made it so difficult to raise money for target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism – that her throat squeezed.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Miss Schroeder about the way the press reacted to her.
“You’d think Kleenex would be my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How a U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial shots in the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening and while the battle is not even close to ending, the gap between the countries may be good for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week came with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods arriving in the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time with the same measure, the last time by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to repay the U.S. with the same measure, and it does not appear that the world’s second-largest economy will change its stance any time soon.
In order for Washington to retreat, it needs to bow to its demands, and publicly agreeing to the terms of the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of a trade war with the US could positively affect China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that making a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to start an economic downturn in either of those countries is actually much more dangerous than observers had previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centered research associate at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by the war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the regime in Syria would gladly accept aid to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financially supported the rebellion.
Europe wins another Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European type won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States suffered its sixth consecutive defeat on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the victory with the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scoring the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, threw the ball from the tie into the water on a par-3 shot at the 16th hole, thus handing the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all rounds, becoming one of four players to ever win 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was overtaken by 5&4 by the lowest-ranking player in the European team, Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The best-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, was beaten 2 and 1 by Ian Palter of England, for whom this may be the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran who played in eight Ryder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the European with the most tournament victories with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we won the cup again.
The team is the most important thing and I am happy that I was able to help,” said emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He passed the torch to his countryman John Rama, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
I feel an incredible pride to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him,” Ram, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches he played in France and now holds the record of 13-21-3 points in his Ryder Cup career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled with making good moves throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finow, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyck said of his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning we almost reached Europe.
We've been trying hard.
All the best to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We must bow down.
We're beaten."
