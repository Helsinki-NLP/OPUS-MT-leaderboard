Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they “look like muppets”
Some members of the Assembly are astounded by the proposal to change their title to "CHUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members from across the political spectrum are worried that this could become a laughing stock.
One Labour official said his group was concerned that the new name "rhymed with Dumb and Hollow."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, this is definitely offensive.
According to one Plaid party member, the whole group is "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was “not biased” about the name change, but noted that the new name MWP has a certain verbal resemblance to a “muppet”.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting a bill to change the name, made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found broad support for the Assembly to become the "Parliament of Wales".
As for the position of its members, the Commission prefers “members of the Welsh Parliament, in short ‘CPU’, but the ‘CPU’ option has received the most support after a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternatives, but reaching a consensus will clearly be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft bill for the amendment within a few weeks.
The reform bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the very design of the commission system.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to discuss the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has an administrative region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor’s name represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is an opponent of the referendum on changing the country's name, has ruled that he will not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the country's name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Shut Down amid Harlem Church Difficulties
“If you look at the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally at every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, both are gone.”
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People today are socializing in different ways,” he added.
“Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where everyone meets regularly.”
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the assets will not be enough for as long as executives expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same situation."
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments where people live who do not help the survival of the other shrines of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist flock moved out in the years after the 1930s.
Then the building became the property of black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin was taken over by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main market street, because they didn’t want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe damage in a fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners drew up a plan for its restoration, during which they ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them the “poor bells.”
The expert, who used the bells in July, has a different description: “Cultural treasure” and “indispensable historical tool.”
Relevant expert, Tiffany Nguyen of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell system in the world to be used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather mentions that St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has unfolded at St. Martin’s over the past few weeks has been a complex tale, woven together by architects and performers, some brought in by secular leaders of the church and others by the diocese of the bishops.
From the vestry – which is the governing body of the congregation, consisting of secular leaders – they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese “would be willing to transfer the costs to the vestry” even though it had no role in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old boy injured by shark during lobster hunt in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday as he snorkeled for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and rushed along with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought the child had caught a lobster and got excited, then realized he was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hamel said that when he reached the boy, he realized that the entire area of his collarbone had been torn.
“I called everyone out of the water because there’s a shark!”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's hospital "Radi" in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but it was judged not to be of a dangerous species.
Giles said the victim suffered traumatic injuries to her upper body.
Authorities have blocked access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury is planning an offensive in the UK market for beauty products
Sainsbury faces off against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty booths at its sites, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of a significant offensive in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, while sales of fashion and household products continue to decline, the biggest beauty booths to date will be located in 11 stores across the country, after which, if the initiative succeeds, similar ones will be found in more locations.
The investment turnaround in the beauty industry is taking place at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the shelves, previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the number of beauty products it offers to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space, similar to the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also releasing its boutique range of makeup so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test discount programs at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will open in Cely Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shifting focus on shopping for smaller amounts of food every day at convenient times mean that supermarkets need to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, Sainsbury’s chief executive, said the sites would look more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggled to beat the Aldi and Lidl discounters by offering more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury’s has Argos in hundreds of stores, and has also opened Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago – which the company says has boosted grocery sales and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to redesign its sites for beauty and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint effort with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company’s facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan, providing a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty booths to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on the ground.
The range of brands we offer is designed to suit every taste and all the needs in a captivating environment with a convenient location, making this combination an attractive destination for beauty products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'infuriated' over Holly Willoughby's refusal to sign <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has “grown up” after television host Holly Willoughby dropped an <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the Truly brand of household appliances and accessories.
The couple’s business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of “This Morning” announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons Den star Peter Jones “boiling” after pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute – and to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones “was furious” when the TV’s “golden girl” admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m – meant there would be no more time for his brand of household products and accessories.
The business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, with rumors that it has doubled Willoughby’s fortune, which is projected to be worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain by plane to head to one of her vacation properties.
One of the sources shared the following: “Truly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave boiled everyone completely unprepared.
No one thought this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe that's full of products waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s host, one of Britain’s most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the massive investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also delay the launch of the brand.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby herself co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016, with Jones, who is 52, joining as chairman of the company in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand’s “ambassador” for M&S and will also replace Anne McParlin as host of I Am a Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult negotiations leading to a “warming up of relations”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news outlets for making comments that would be considered “unsuitable for the president” and too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his own humorous “journalistic” way.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as a "great step towards the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons".
Negotiations for the elimination of these weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Jung-ho, told the UN General Assembly that North Korea “does not see a reciprocal attitude” from the United States to its country’s first steps on the path to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
In his speech, Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things.
“Our relationship with North Korea is excellent,” he said.
“We were headed to war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
We are now enjoying a wonderful relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending missile tests, releasing hostages and returning the bodies of U.S. servicemen home.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there,” Trump said, pointing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island and kill hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population was forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases there is an unequivocal view that no international assistance is requested, which makes things a bit challenging,” Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is forming a team to head to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the reconstruction efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not a common view on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this logistics even more.
A hospital ship previously stationed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims was heading for Palu, but it would be at least three days before it could reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has placed the improvement of Indonesia’s backward infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign by investing heavily in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances constantly harass his office, while Joko goes to the urns again the next year.
Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturge brought a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturges received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He set the ball on his left foot, then fired a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty area and headed for the upper right corner of the grid.
She transferred the plongished Kepa Arisabalaga and entangled herself unrescuably in the net.
“I tried to take a good position to get the ball, because players like Shaq are always looking for passes in the front positions, so I just tried to earn as much time as possible for a good shot to the goal,” Sturidge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, I pushed the ball and I just shot without thinking much.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after a goal of his Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The striker of the "blue" served with a fifth to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> exchanged a quick double serve in the center.
Then he fired a quick shot, bringing Hazard to a clean spot in the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 this Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea’s next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the quake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Multiple people are trapped among the ruins of buildings that collapsed after a 7.5-magnitude quake struck the country on Friday and led to waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is dotted with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Burkenhead, Mercyside.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds from Grayson Meows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the perpetrator of the murder.
Police are asking for help from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I beg everyone who has been close to John Street in Burkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
“I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something with their cameras on the dashboard, to contact us as they may have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Burkenhead and that she was found on private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends who thought the woman was acquainted with her arrived at the scene and asked where she had been found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Meows tried to get back to his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
The man remained silent when he found out about what had happened.
Residents were told that it would be hours before they were allowed to return home.
One police officer told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She keeps saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans passed through the cordon, while another van was left outside.
Police are stationed in the cordon to monitor the block of flats.
All those with information are asked to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue Becomes the Newest Memorial Hit by "Rewriting History"
Her ban would be poetic justice for his almost Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “madness” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's to the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be turned into a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent performance of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still regard as deserving of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph the following: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, this is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is the mid-17th-century conflict that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly identifiable face that represents one side of the division that occurred.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worthy of commemoration and commemoration.”
Pig Killer Injures Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his last name as Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered in blood near a junkyard in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer was preparing to inject his pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Xinjiang, Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door to the next-door trash can open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a bloody zurla in the shed.
Forensic examinations have confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer deadly, the report said.
“My cousin’s feet were bloodied and disfigured,” said Cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The killer animal didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so it could not attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence from the crime scene.
It was also reported that Yuan's family and market leadership were negotiating compensation for the death.
Although they are rare, pigs have previously been reported to attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured after the attack.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had chained a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer reported to CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not meant to hurt anyone.
But one must also treat them with respect," the man concludes.
Weakening hurricane Rose will cause frequent and torrential rains in the southwestern United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane counted at 5 a.m. Sunday Eastern Time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rose approaches the Baha California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep north into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching synclinal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At the local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, wreckage streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected, especially over most of Arizona.
Lightning floods may occur in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely imprudent to travel a handful in the desert when tropical rains threaten.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to raised dust and gusty winds.
The approaching synclinal will lead to heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to get rainfall of more than half an inch, which will lead to bearable small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rainy season.
Late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin approaching Arizona before rain sweeps into a larger zone late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October may bring large temperature fluctuations to the U.S. as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of the dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There's a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures of around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh’s hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the fascinating spectacle of the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued, with the networks interrupting their regular turnaround programs in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and under which the FBI was to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Cavanaugh was making out with her drunk and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely certain that such a thing has never happened.
It is likely that even more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen saw the testimonial on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate data available on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also traditionally struggled to measure the number of people watching from their workplaces.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football match or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him on Friday being whistled by protesters as he tried to grab an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
During all the harassment for several minutes, he never lifted his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here, standing in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the government?
“You have the power, while many women are completely helpless,” they continued.
Flake replied that his office had already come out with a statement, and before the elevator doors were closed, he announced that he would make a further decision during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks provided tight live coverage a few hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh’s nomination to the attention of the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominees next week, which Democrats in the opposition are pushing for.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Koons and a few senators, Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political play' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called “lady’s game plan” for Brexit, suggesting that collecting UK tariffs on the EU and vice versa is “completely absurd”.
The shooting of Wade Simms: police arrested suspect Deethan Simpson for the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Deaton Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, with police reporting that Simms lost his glasses during a fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson’s DNA on them, a CBS WAFB affiliate said.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shot against Wade.
The bail is set at $350,000, Advocate said.
The Eastern Baton Rouge Forensic Service released a preliminary report Friday citing a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police’s fugitive search unit, the police crime lab, Southern University’s police and local residents for their assistance in the investigation, which contributed to the arrest.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for “timely justice.”
Simms was 20 years old.
The six-foot-and-a-half-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade reported that the team was "collapsed" and "shocked" after Wade's death.
Wade said, “It’s something that worries a person all the time.”
Volcano scatters ash over Mexico City
Ejected from the volcano Popocatepetl ash reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash ejections were recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center has observed numerous tremors and tremors.
Photos posted on social media showed a thin layer of dust covering the windshields of cars in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Hokimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie as thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing secession vote.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began throwing eggs and dust paint at the peacekeepers, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, there were other clashes with the police, as the police resorted to their batons to control the situation.
For hours, independence-supporting groups shouted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while pro-independence groups responded with “Spain forever.”
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical care for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region even a year after a referendum held on October 1 was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority voted in favor of independence, although activity was low as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the polling stations in the region in a series of violent clashes.
Independence-seeking groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it was forced to go on a different route.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer has any hope for Catalonia’s chances of gaining independence.
“Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they were able to vote, but now it looks like we’re at a standstill.”
Despite an important victory, even with a slight difference, in the regional elections last December, Catalan political parties supporting independence are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are either in self-imposed exile or are arrested pending trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that “it’s getting more and more tense.”
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested awaiting a preliminary trial last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
He argued that “my candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing from the Spanish government.”
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said there was damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The newcomer to the Premier League, Livingston, surprised the Rangers and inflicted only a second loss on Steven Gerrard in his first 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive, and the team of Gary Holt equaled points with the second in the standings Hibernian.
Gerard's team remained without a victory on foreign ground in the Premier League this season, and the next Sunday faced the driver Harts, from which he is behind by eight points in the standings.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without a loss in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of the loss since changing office Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a good opportunity against the idle guests
Holt's team had to lead the score long before he scored a goal, and his direct playing style made it extremely difficult for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his blow went sideways, after which Alan Litgow fired past the beam after Craig Halkett turned the ball headlong towards him.
The hosts left the Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously make it difficult for guests from static positions.
And that’s how the winning goal came about.
The Rangers committed a misdemeanor, and Livingston played well as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined with each other and brought out Meng, who led the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
Until now, the Rangers had more possession of the ball, but faced the impenetrable defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
The Rangers goalkeeper saved Scott Pittman's kick, and Little's head went past the door after another static position for Livingston.
In the penalty area of Livingston were centers, which, however, were easily cleared, and the referee twice did not respect the claims of the guests for the penalty – first after a single fight between Halket and Glenn Middleton Reserve, and then in case of doubts about playing with a hand.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays simply superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve its performance.
The style of play and squad has hardly changed since the team’s return to the Premier League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halket was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga constantly kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warhol under pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard’s leadership, they demonstrated some great things, but in this case they were well below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, and only once managed to split the defense of the hosts – this loss should wake up the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to repair relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship has cooled due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s admission to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters flocked around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s own policies and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the fault caused by one visitor, who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
A cyclist died after a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but the cyclist died on the spot.
The crash comes a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by an escaped driver on Childers Street, located near a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police announced that its officers were working to identify the man, after which they would notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and motorists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, the Prison Service said.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at close to 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to master it, special officers from the Tordano detachment were summoned, who will have to deal with eight prisoners, such as the rebellion itself, confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to their faces and received medical attention on the spot.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: “Specially trained officers have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it very clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended.”
The Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack by a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, riot police officers were summoned to prison to deal with a severe riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens flash flooding of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (although arid areas may benefit)
Arizona is seldom hit by a tropical storm, but there is a good chance that this will happen early next week, as the slimming hurricane Rose sweeps through the desert to the southwest, bringing with it the risk of lightning floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established lightning protection posts on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a different route over Finisk on Tuesday, and late Monday may bring rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rainfall possible in some places.
For those not threatened by flash floods, the Rose rain can actually be a blessing as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain is likely to be useful as the southwestern part is currently in drought.
“According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second most severe category.”
First, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to land reaching the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which on Sunday morning still boasts a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the drought near Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over part of Mexico can be severe and lead to a significant risk of updates.
"Total rains are expected from as high as 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and waste-carrying streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in Midsemer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remained “stable”.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Aven and Somerset said.
Police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered from the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Every vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote that rejects the treacherous and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered from the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations from decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the indictment hearing.
The president made a statement on Saturday that "today the American people have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities" of Kavanaugh.
“Every vote in support of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service,” the president told a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our time.
“While I’m not a candidate, I’m actually in,” Trump said.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting for the good candidates."
Trump said the Democrats have set themselves a mission to “obstruction and obstruction.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, one senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis, death toll rises
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were swept away by gigantic waves when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when in the evening the coast was swept away by waves up to six meters (18 feet) high, taking many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami hit after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t immediately flee, causing many to fall victim to the disaster,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), during a briefing in Jakarta.
“The water had dragged cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything in its path,” Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
“Some people climbed the trees and managed to escape from the water,” he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and twisted bridges, and a water-surrounded mosque.
Secondary tremors continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area populated by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) has declared that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographic location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “huge” and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the quake's epicenter.
He also added that “communications have been completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala.”
The Red Cross said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already made their way to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticized for not informing about the Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement of the message.
Shared on social media amateur videos show a man on the top floor of a building shouting panic warnings to people on the street about an impending tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall crashes into the shore and carries both cars and buildings.
Reuters was unable to confirm the video's authenticity in a timely manner.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala managed to reach Palu safely, where they found shelter in tarpaulin shelters stretched out in their office yard, they walked past a number of scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me that they had seen countless houses destroyed.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the rescue and recovery efforts, some complain that foreign rescuers with extensive experience in such situations have been prevented from reaching Palu.
Pursuant to Indonesian regulations, funding, dispatch of personnel and supplies from abroad can only begin if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“The disaster is still at a regional level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government announces that this is a national disaster, we can accept international assistance, but they have not yet declared such a status.”
While Palu falls on the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those still missing continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel reached the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the racers in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue ticks, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he added.
Thieves steal $26,750 while charging an ATM in Newport, Levy
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was charging an ATM in Newport Levy, according to a press release from Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to charge it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “approached running behind the back of a Brink employee” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, the statement continued, but police did not specify the number involved in the theft.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspects should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Along with announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has been using it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who quit “for emotional reasons,” the show’s creator told us.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’ or ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It passed from Kanye, which means only one person, just Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are.”
The rapper is one of many famous in his field, which has changed its name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and titles, including Puff Daddy, P. Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preferences for the pseudonyms Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's previous collaborators, Jay-Z, also presented in a version with or without dashes and/or capital letters in his nickname.
Mexico's president vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force. This happened as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President López Obrador vowed “never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, as student movements with left-wing political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador swore an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for AI development
At a time when China is becoming more active on the front of the development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its budget for research in this field, according to AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various units of the US government made statements on the topic of AI, although the US as a whole does not have an official strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: the country aims to become number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI development budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make further breakthroughs in terms of AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could also double the chances of the next major AI achievement coming from the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Melon Lee worked on an AI system that beat America’s most successful athlete, then served as CEO at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee paid tribute to the federal government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Competition, and asked when the next one would be helpful in identifying new visionaries.
“Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government funding,” Lee said.
“It is not China that takes away academic leaders, but corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university lighthouses to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its AI program.
“I think doctors in AI should be automatically offered green cards,” he said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI development.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, hasn’t seen any activity in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonia's citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which is blocking Macedonia's EU and NATO membership.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents claims against its territorial integrity, and therefore imposes a veto on its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gheorghe Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while a boycott campaign casts doubt on whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognize its validity.
The question on the ballot papers is: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying in order to achieve the entry of the country of Macedonia, formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have decided that they will comply with the result to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
To change the name of the state, two-thirds of parliamentary representatives must vote on it.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the urns.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gyose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country’s name, which will pave the way for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of the tents stretched by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the servants' door," Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to the investments Macedonia needs, as unemployment in the country is above 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, because more than 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his own vote.
The minister also said that the positive result will lead to “affirmation of the future of our people”.
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute of Political Research published a survey findings that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the required activity.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian TV Thelma, revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is unsuccessful, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the defense of Brighton and brought the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the pitch.
He overtook three defenders from Brighton before sprinting the ball into the empty space ahead.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left the others behind on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he passed to the left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch turned the ball back to Aguero, who with a blow with his right foot overcame goalkeeper Brighton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his goal.
“Aguero is struggling with some injuries in his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We wanted him to play for 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that point.”
But it was Sterling who secured the Sky Blues' initial advance in this Premier League game.
He signed in the 29th minute.
In the situation for the goal Aguero received a pass deep in the half of Brighton.
Immediately he released a pulling pass on the left flank towards Leroy Sané.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The striker of the "sky blues" managed to score close, shortly before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhein Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies
Since the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, it makes little sense for another game of the title starter pitcher.
Still, the always-ambitious Scherzer hopes to be the titular on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies if the match is relevant to the Rockies, who lead one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies have secured at least a wild card match after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still uncertain whether they will win their first division title.
“While we are not fighting for anything ourselves, we want to end the season with a good game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game of the year for them.
Why would I want to miss a game like that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a launch pitch for Sunday, but are expected to allow Scherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he would have practiced on Thursday and would have had the normal rest time until Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump wins supporters in West Virginia
The president hinted obliquely at the situation with his Supreme Court-elect Brett Cavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
“This is one of the biggest moments in our history – I also say that while I’m not a candidate, I’m actually participating, and that’s why I’m fighting hard for the right candidates,” Trump said.
“You all see this scary, scary radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourself are witnessing their ruthlessness, their malice.
They don’t care when they can hurt, who they have to run over in order to cling to power and government, because they are only interested in power and government, but we will not give them.”
The Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves the goal of "interfering and obstructing".
“What we’ve all seen over the last four days,” he continued, calling Democrats “angry, nasty, mean and unfaithful.”
The president recalled the Senate Judiciary Committee, referring to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused strong whistles from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I waited – it was really bad sign language – maybe the worst I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last Labour MP to have been told he wasn’t welcome – just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement in the days of previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings to involve everyone and be fruitful.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, Friday’s meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of a “smooth and measured” policy have long been forgotten, if ever on the agenda.
It became increasingly clear that different views were not tolerated within the Labour Party, and that each opinion was judged on the basis of how much it pleased the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues for whom I had previously worked thought that they shared similar political views began to expect me to take a reverse turn and take positions that I would never agree to – whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I say – there follows a whole offensive tirade on social media calling for a recall, a rejection of moderate politics, statements that I do not belong to Labour.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I even got more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the comments for me are at least mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist rhetoric every day without being afraid of it.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-spread, with every sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becoming more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I have received many advices to keep quiet, not to talk so much and that then “everything will be fine”.
But that’s not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Thatcher government, which through its neglect led to the literal collapse of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or as a minister.
I have never concealed my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political stance and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state heads for Brexit, it will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in reality, my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of recall or political excommunication will prevent me from acting in the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Unbeatable Air Leads the Rankings
The two late essays may have changed the easy final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent Premier League match.
The team is already leading the standings and the only one of the ten teams is without a loss so far.
Better defense and better use of opportunities proved decisive in the match, from which coach Peter Murchy and his team can be very pleased.
"I'm happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the past matches and we are still without a loss," said Murchy.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their position better than we did."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frazier Clima, led Air forward in the result, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to catch up on the result.
Klimo increased the lead for Air from a penalty kick shortly before the half-time, marking an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the extra kick, thus making the result 17-5 for Air on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful extra hit by Baghot, reduced the lead to only five points.
There was a prolonged suspension of the game due to a severe injury to Ruarid Noth, who was carried out on a stretcher, and after the resumption of the match, Air increased their advance after an essay by Stafford McDowell and a successful additional blow by Klima.
Then the acting Air Captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by exerting strong pressure and realizing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts regained the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down Clima without a ball, from the subsequent penalty McPherson carried out an essay using Air's advancing offensive line.
Klimo realized the extra kick, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and took the wing Gregor Henry on the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kearnan seems to have headed for a more direct and warm industry after it was revealed that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis on the BBC’s popular show, which he also co-wrote and co-starred with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the show, with Kearnan seemingly already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kearnan was planning to join Glasgow’s “best-selling restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia hopes that the ship will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are constantly patrolling the rigging of La Paz Marine Headquarters.
An ocean blue flag flies over public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – as is the call to sail again across the Pacific.
In fact, that hope is currently the strongest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a judgment by an international court on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"The strength is in Bolivia, there is a sense of serenity and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's claim and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia who is set to head to a contested re-election battle next year, also put a lot of weight on Monday's judgement.
“We are very close to regain access to the Pacific Ocean,” Morales said last August.
But some analysts believe that the court's likelihood of deciding in Bolivia's favor is quite small, and even if it did decide in her favor, it would not change things in reality.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to seize Chilean territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the international court’s verdict is just six months after hearing the latest arguments indicates that the case is “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually hurt her.
“The problem of access to the ocean has been exacerbated by the current government of Bolivia,” Zarate said.
He then hinted that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric had wiped out Chile’s remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have a normal dialogue after what happened.
The two countries have not held diplomatic missions to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court’s decision was being taken unusually quickly.
He said on Monday Bolivia would have "an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides".
Kalzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales — who continues to be one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the problem of access to the ocean as a “political crutch.”
“Bolivia will never relinquish its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first unless it is able to trust Washington.
Ri delivered his speech to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises it made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comments come after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of restarting a deadlocked diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri called “vain hope” the idea that continued US sanctions and objections to a declaration to end the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture on the path to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal, which it sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest scream on massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun's rays, you do not need to look for more.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that captivated the catwalk during Paris Fashion Week.
Quite impractical hats caused a wave on Instagram in the summer, as designers sent their eye-catching creations to stun the fashion community.
Valentino’s standout proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide periphery that literally engulfed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a witch hat, and even a pineapple—but they weren’t meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and reminded not so much of high fashion as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a full snorkel and glasses scuba gear, while another looked like a melted ice cream scoop.
If you’re into fashion, you’re in luck.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
The giant hats come very soon after “La Bomba” – a straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on everyone’s heads – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that took over social networks led to the appearance of another huge design of the catwalk – a straw beach bag, almost as big as the one wearing a swimsuit model.
The orange-colored raffia bag, with raffia fringes and nailed with a handle of white leather, was the eye-catching item in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitide told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer made such a big impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for bulky accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, continuing in 2018 with another excellent performance of exam scores that is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports disciplines, art, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen careers and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can draw up and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language that you understand, your words will reach them.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year’s exams, we see that languages are the most successful for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A score.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students scored A in Chinese, with the same score being scored by 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice on the part of students receive the same treatment as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Work Skills Commission found that 17% of employers found it difficult to find employees because of insufficient language skills.
Therefore, proficiency in foreign languages is becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more job positions require the proficiency of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill, which remains for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multilingual person one breast ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, and French was the only language whose proficiency reached a double-digit rate of 15%.
That is why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ from one language to another.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more important to the UK in a future plan by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child may have, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers being specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages should be really considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
It's going to be fair.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are eager to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in the team's first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is unclear how many minutes he will play in the match.
"He will be on the pitch between one and 48 minutes," Walton said jokingly on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would likely play relatively few minutes in the match.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of pre-season preparation for the Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the new season,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five planned rallies, which include stops at familiar locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing a confirmatory vote on his election to fill a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to back the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when casting votes in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below through the live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to review this week’s hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in which tensions arose over allegations of immoral sexual acts, delaying the Senate’s affirmative vote for up to a week while an FBI investigation is pending.
The main goal of this series of rallies, however, is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
That’s why President Donald Trump’s campaign announced that these five rallies next week aim to “enhance volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so essential to its agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season full of commitments,” a Trump campaign spokesperson told Reuters.
The rally tonight, scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and grab the media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will make his second visit this month to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
"Ryder Cup" 2018: The US team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue “foursome” matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what the “Ryder Cup” needed.
Changing the advantage in the sport is a rather subjective concept, in which, however, players believe unreservedly, even more so in competitions like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
“They were six points in the lead and now it’s only four, so I guess we got a little bit of momentum,” Jordan Speight said at the end of today’s race day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points with only twelve more to allocate.
However, as Speet says, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope, if we have to judge by the sporting form of Speet and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them scored three out of four possible points.
Speet shows excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
The cheering voices of the fans grew stronger as he advanced in the round, in which with a precise punch he equalized the result in the fourth match, after he and Thomas lagged behind by two punches after the first two holes.
His blow, which won them the match at the 15th hole, was met with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost for the American team.
“It’s important not to think about anything else and focus on your own game,” Speight says.
That’s all these players have now.
18 holes to remember.
The only players with more points than Speight and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe won four out of four and everything seems to be working out for them.
The Mollywoods were the only couple who didn’t make “gods” on Sunday afternoons, but they also didn’t make “gods” either on Saturday mornings or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These successes, as well as the way energy seemed to flow between them and enthusiastic fans, reinforced the view that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari that will bring a potential victory to Europe as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talks about European fame, however, turned out to be a bit premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly coped with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the “fourball” matches of the morning, while he partnered with Alex Noren.
"Gods" and two "doubles" on the first nine holes put the Swede and the Spaniard in problems that they could not cope with.
There is no other way to solve your problems on Sundays.
“Fourball and Foursome games are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any time.
The Europeans played better team and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of “foursome” matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight to the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup, leading the United States by 10-6 after playing the matches of the formats "fourball" and "foursom" on Saturday.
The inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari started with two wins against the inconclusive Tiger Woods, bringing their assets at the Le Golf National race to four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Björn’s European team dominated the morning four-ball matches over the Americans, who made a mistake after a mistake, and in the end Europe won the series with 3-1 wins.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the four-way games, where they won two victories, but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs 8 points out of 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari, nicknamed Mollywood, became only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after that sensational weekend.
Having beaten Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball games, they were extremely motivated to beat broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambu with an even stronger 5&4 score.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally showed flashes of his genius, but so far he has lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome games, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning "fourball" matches, partnered with Henrik Stenson in the "foursome" clashes in the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka - number one and number three in the world, respectively.
However, the team of Europe failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas returned hopes to the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult 2<0xC2><0xA7>1 victory against the Spaniard John Ram and Ian Polter in the four-ball matches, and later returned to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the four-way matches, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team made up for a four-point deficit before the singles, and according to the regulation, the team of Fourik will keep the trophy even in a draw.
However, after being beaten in two consecutive days, their chances of a turnaround on Sunday do not seem particularly great.
North Korea says 'no way' to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened distrust of the United States and there was no way the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong-hou said “significant goodwill measures” had been taken over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying a nuclear test site, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without trusting the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances will we be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri expressed North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “step-by-step” approach to eliminating nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking step-by-step measures, his statement seemed meaningful as it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for “nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula” and Trump gave assurances of North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States is pushing for ‘nuclear weapons first’ and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can make us fall to our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don’t know us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “evil President” Trump called Kim “a man-missile” on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with “complete destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea removes its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no deadline for this and said: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “implementation of the Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament takes place.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in a bid to halt funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of making “gangster demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to destroy a missile site and nuclear complex if the U.S. takes “appropriate measures.”
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is causing all students to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning “all night long” with the help of caffeine.
A faculty member found that the world’s number one university students often don’t even think about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has prepared what he believes is the first course of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came to me and said, “Why are they telling me this now, in my last year?”
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, explains to students the most important things about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of a dorm room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
Another part of the participants described how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” added Prof. Keisler.
A culture of pride in “all night learning” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate and quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he says – even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, causing them to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler draft the course by taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining a competing institution.
Professor Kaysler recommended that students think about setting a sleep and wake alarm and know the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal crushed Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's jester broke Steven Gerrard's ideological team and won 1-0 for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as a guest from a February triumph with 4–1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only inflicted Gerard's second defeat in his 18 games as manager, leaving his team with eight points less than the breakaway team of Harts, the leader of La Broca in the Visegrád.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, devoid of constructive ideas, at no time seemed close to equalization.
After the match, the Rangers disguised themselves in sixth place, and Livingston are already third, lagging behind the second Hibernian only by a goal difference.
For the Rangers, there may be additional problems, as side referee Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livingston 11 who scored a point against the Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team resisted all the actions of the opponent.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did better on the rarer occasions when they owned it.
They should have scored in the second minute, when Menga led with a single touch Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a good opportunity.
Later centering on Keegan Jacobs from a foul found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow diverted the ball away from the rear beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a penalty in the 15th minute when he collided with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thompson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers scored only two precise shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily handled the head-on shot by Lassana Coulibaly and the weak shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livy’s goal in the 34th minute was surprising in terms of possession of the ball, it was fully deserved.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pointed the ball at Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly passed to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by swapping Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this swap almost immediately led to a result when the wing handed over to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingston, however, continued to force the guests to play in a home-friendly style of play, with Litgow and Halket constantly knocking off the long balls sent forward.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last minutes, but McGregor managed to cope with the blow of Jacobs, and in the subsequent corner Litgow shot with his head past the beam.
Reserve Glen Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty at the end of the match after a one-man match with Jacobs, but Thomson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science since then, the Geiger counter also became a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, featuring the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, was released.
Man: "What the hell is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure he cares right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to “see” foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory.
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and are re-injected into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injected into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription “Let’s make America great again”, while participating in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was whistled in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a pointless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat that read “Let’s make America great again,” he spoke out against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people a lot and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began the show featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault complaints made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's performance was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“I was trapped behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They harassed me!
And then they say I’m on a sinking ship,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that he will put on his Superman suit because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
The comments sparked at least two whistles from the audience and the SNL team members looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one saying: “The whole studio has shut up.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
TPUSA leader Candace Turner tweeted: “To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR CONfronting the crowd.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West was just "being himself, and that's wonderful."
“But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I think welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That’s what we are,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and now “is officially known as Kenny West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Puffy Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrates' Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
'Game of Thrones' star Keith Harrington opposes toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as the sword-wielding Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the macho character’s stereotype, saying showing such roles on screen often makes young people think they have to be “crude” to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed “something went wrong” and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admits he feels “strongly convinced” that the issue needs to be resolved.
“At the moment, I am personally firmly convinced – what have we gone wrong in terms of masculinity?” he said.
“What are we teaching adolescent men about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that makes guys feel they need to become this particular type of men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how can we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, claiming that he was "finished with the battlefields and the horses."
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's "True West" re-enactment, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that acquaintance with his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in "Game of Thrones".
“I met my wife in this series, so that’s how he gave me my future family and determined my life for the future,” he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the girl Kit Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China reported a jump of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China’s health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in KGBT communities is widespread.
According to studies, due to conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sexual contact with men end up marrying women.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies there has been a leak of Republican senators, denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of her team posted personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia’s lawmakers’ pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and websites of the ultra-right wing.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on allegations of immoral sexual conduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts is linked to Waters’ office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
“This unsubstantiated statement is completely false and is an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unsubstantiated statement is completely false and is an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“There is anger in this denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“That suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
He shouldn't be provocative.
I don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of also appearing angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee for Waters’s seat in the midterm elections, also made his point on Twitter.
“Importantly, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had referred the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies for these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be held legally accountable for all of their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team.”
“Johnny English Explodes Again” Review – The Weak Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in any new British-starred film, and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with “Johnny English” and returned in 2011 with “Johnny English Returns.”
Will the self-mockery and facial expressions that speak of how obvious we are to be stupid become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes uprooted and a rubber face, has the permission to renew things a second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a large comic creation designed for non-English-speaking film lovers.
He is, of course, a foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of flattering glamour, owns a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr. Bean, and a large part of the man who contributed a note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
In addition, it was initially based on the chaos left behind by the traveler and international man whom Atkinson played in the already forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard.
In the last Johnny English movie, there are a couple of good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and for a short time the fins squealed in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially when "serious" film brands like "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and Johnny English’s freak accidents are not, in my opinion, innovative and focused, as Actinson’s non-playing reminiscent of Mr. Bean.
It is always a prerequisite that the UK faces serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has hacked Britain’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the operatives to the horror of the duty agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a pompous and pompous figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Theresa-May role, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she needs to call in a retired agent, as all acting agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher in a chic center, but who illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good hits when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English is summoned to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a cheerful role in which Vicky Pepperdine's talent is somewhat wasted.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve Her Majesty’s big secret service problems and face off against the fatally beautiful Ophelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farces: disguised as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they create chaos when they sneak onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes real anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All the jokes are certainly taken from the previous film, but because so cute and lush, here there is a lot more content intended for children.
Pretty mediocre production.
As with other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: can’t the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies plans to make British workers work four days a week but pay five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan to allow Britons to work four times a week but get paid for five.
The party says it wants company bosses to give the savings made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would fit the economic program and the party’s plans to shake the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day work week has been approved by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen right away, but the four-day work week is an aspiration that fits into the approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not in the party’s politics and is not considered by it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to unveil his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “impersonal directors” and “speculators” in utility firms.
The Chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that current owners of shares in water supply companies may not get their full share, as the Labour government could impose “deductions” based on the found violations.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and set up privatization funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private firms to employees who can accumulate annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy spoke to 60 Minutes on whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week and raised the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could prompt some of the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Peley asked Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after this statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, firm and unequivocal."
Graham’s voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
“I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and to change that, it takes a shaking charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blassie Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive cast of performers and fulfills an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the great Central Park lawn, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also get to know the true goal of the event – eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international protection group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending no email to a world leader, making a phone call or otherwise contacting to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen 12 years before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” – people think they are doing something meaningful when signing an online petition or posting on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, pushing for multiple different goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and messages stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include “The Power of Nutrition,” a UK-established partnership between investors and contractors, a commitment to “help children reach their full potential,” which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 tweets were received from “global citizens.”
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a mere historic memo,” Food Force Ambassador Tracy Ullman told audiences at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Global Citizen” replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and still fail.
But just as with the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Naval Forces to ‘Block’ and Prevent Energy Exports, Home Secretary Says
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zink has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia’s involvement in Syria – in particular, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our navy, ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed attendees at the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
“The economic option with respect to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace fuels,” he said, while defining Russia as a “one-number pony,” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting liquefied gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that Trump says makes Berlin a “hostage.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Look Seriously" at 2020 Presidential Candidacy, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “look seriously” at running for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to come into Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will look seriously at the presidential candidacy.”
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I worry to the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been candid in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters did not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this nomination.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favour and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic officials discussed about a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed to Trak Palin’s PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my own son has been going through since I returned is familiar to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are going home with,” she told audiences at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an “elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans that “they come back a little changed, hardened, coming back and wondering if they will get the respect that they and their brothers in arms have given to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Vassila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, and was included in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vassila’s police department.
18 States and District of Columbia Support Challenges to New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang violence and domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the county filed a goodwill petition in Washington on Friday in support of asylum seekers and challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claims her partner “and the sons of his violent gang members” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
U.S. lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the U.S., as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrants Board of Appeal that allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia lawyer Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered according to the specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the report said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that policies that deny immigrants entry are damaging to the U.S. economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political belief,” Sessions said in a July 11 policy statement.
The sanctuary was never intended to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious ones – that people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double during search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
“I feel very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Dwee Harris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were housed outside Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors due to ongoing secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembers how he felt the terrible earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was trapped in a broken wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “braking” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official newspaper in China ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump cited a paid publication of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Pecki was trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election highlighted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they level import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the United States and China at the start of the trade war, tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump’s Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing was hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “currently doubles this harassment by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America’s respected tradition of free speech and press by running paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited speeches, and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese people may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, given that the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify exactly who.
With the Kavanaugh pogrom, Republicans are pushing back women voters for midterm elections, analysts warn
With many senior Republicans backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over several sexual assault allegations, analysts warned there would be retaliation, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the tray are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue with the vote.
These things can’t be reversed,” Grant Raher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Raher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” during a demonstration in the Senate hallway as Republicans who control the Judicial Commission decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blassey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be ruled out,” said Stu Rotenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say the problem is already serious; it’s true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among voters women in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing her accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest there could be a backlash if Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it’s about the way Republicans deal with it and how they treat it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on who to trust in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a bit more leaning toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say they believe Kavanaugh probably or surely lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is now investigating Ford’s allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals while they were at a party during her Yale graduation in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, has launched a venture that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
"We have to do it now," he said regarding the undertaking.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “online personal data repository” or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through any browser, and at the same time is all of them at the same time.
The unique thing about the online repository of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “giving authority to personal data.”
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is for the company to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who have contracted to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team weren’t talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change or not when all their business models were completely updated overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy for trade and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a strong influence in the net neutrality debate.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest conferred the Victoria Cross in World War I
100 years are celebrated in the hometown of the only Anglican priest, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for his participation in the fighting during the First World War.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, not realizing that he had been awarded the highest military honors of Britain.
A memorial was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's medal-winning work.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in very thick fog and under heavy artillery and machine gun fire."
Later, he attacked the firing line and with "incredible courage" led the line forward before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lt. Col. Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Wang laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wang said it was “a great honor to participate in the parade” and added “the virtue of a real hero is demonstrated through the support that will be provided to many people.”
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine that you wait all night to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and in the end you can not witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 matches, including six of the main map, and was to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Geghard Moussassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after waking up until early hours, especially because of the duel.
Fan described the switching of the children’s cartoon on Twitter as “some kind of sick joke.”
“The government has regulated that at 6 p.m. this content is not appropriate, so the program was replaced with a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, in response to a question about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, yes."
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they would work on scheduling the meetings to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem,” Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday and we can’t plan things so that the event takes place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't like that. He was government.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five matches instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘lower’ because of his sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality – but that’s what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, is on sick leave for several months.
Speaking on Laverne Daily’s first program, he said he felt “less” than everyone else as he grew up because “it wasn’t socially acceptable to like both girls and boys.”
He said, “To this day, feelings of inferiority and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove it was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year’s British Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he does this because he is happy to be able to live openly, without consequences, and wants to inspire “hope” for others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - he was "surprised."
Daley married Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but says the age gap has never been a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs.”
They became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley himself says that “his whole outlook” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you I was only interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn’t accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be on the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to be there for me, Dad, not even in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and the moment I found out he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that all my life I had dreamed of jumping to the Olympics in front of the audience at home. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song, "Proud" by Heather Small, which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still made him shiver.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British Summer Time.
Lost form Mickelson remains on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be linked to failure.
Mikkelson, who participated in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Fourik for the “fourball” and “foursome” matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major player in the U.S. team again, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and training his shots from a distance in the hopes of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the peak of his career was never among the most straightforward players, is not in optimal shape for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong shot.
And if the pitch itself isn’t disturbing enough, in Sunday’s ninth game Mickelson will face the precision British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and are aiming to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12 singles games, make a strong start, it may turn out that Mickelson’s match is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, though he could hardly have said anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He’s confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play only two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just happened and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play like everyone else.”
Mikelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his Ryder Cup career, which has never come close to his impressive individual achievements.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Fourik said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great person for any team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives so much more than just playing.”
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great lead may soon be melted
European team captain Thomas Björn knows from personal experience that the big lead accumulated before the singles matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be erased.
The Dane made his debut at Valderrama in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Ballisteros led by five points ahead of the Americans, but just on the finish line was almost caught and barely managed to hold the victory with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Golframa; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but very hard,” said Björn, after the 2018 European team won with 5–3 sessions on Friday and yesterday.
“So history has to show me and everyone on the team that it’s not over.
Be ready to attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing is over until you see the end result on the dashboard.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy and that is where we need to stay focused.
“I’ve always said I’m only thinking about the 12 players on our team, but we’re also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of the players on a difficult golf course, Björn added: “I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come to the fore, and this is different.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you go out alone, then you put your full capacity as a golfer to the test.
This is the message that must reach the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he too must be dealt to the end.”
Unlike Björn, rival captain Jim Furik will want his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these big gays on the last day – he was part of the triumph of “Brookline”, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed “The Miracle of Medinah”.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw at Brookline and Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under enormous pressure.
So we formed our squad and distributed our boys the way we wanted to, so we could try to do the impossible tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Palter will meet the other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
"I chose these players in this order because I think it gives us the best chance of success," Björn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany postponed the launch of a new warship
The newest frigate of the German navy was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand’s flagship of new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned by the fleet in 2007, will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the ports of dock.
But the continuous delays mean that the avant-garde warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power overseas – will be old when they go into service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws are particularly important as the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of this class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also becoming a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – out of the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the newest frigates became especially important in light of recent warnings that the German navy was shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, admitted that the fleet was actually “depleting from ships capable of carrying out missions.”
The official said the problem has become bigger over time as old ships have been decommissioned but no new ones have been made available.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in a mansion in the Scottish mountains, aims to establish how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow common bats as well as brown-eared water nightshades at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in the mansion to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of call sounds of bats, as well as which species make them.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. meadow creation, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
Risks to populations could be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve at the Threave estate in the Dumfries and Gallaway area, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Manor manager David Thompson says it's the perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a great terrain for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a suitable habitat completed.
But there’s a lot more about bats that isn’t known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed that it is important to check for the presence of bats before carrying out property maintenance activities, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a shelter could kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the community to help.
She said, "I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don't know what's happening to their populations."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him “fake news,” saying people “want to become famous” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes these allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have then paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram video addressing his 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were published, the 33-year-old Ronaldo branded the post as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations that they call “unacceptable publication of suspected privacy matters,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is arguably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's room where he is alleged to have raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a "good boy" of the "99 percent", but in the case he just succumbed to the "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Majorga also said she went to the police and had been photographed with her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “horrified of revenge” and feared being “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' losing carmakers
Britain will “sorry forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added it was “worrisome” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a delay at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, say they will close their factory for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in cases of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which the industry said could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to complete its inventory at the plant in Derbyshire, the company said, and so production will stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May’s chess plan for a future relationship with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio’s 4’s Today program.
“Following the claims of not only Toyota but also other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.”
Toyota can’t say how long production will stop, but in the longer term, it warns that the additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tzuvalaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly worried: “From my experience, I judge that if these jobs go, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have set out an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, White House says
A crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by another week” as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues his fight, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumours about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was testified by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There’s still no date for that, it could be this week, but seeing all the other things happening in the Supreme Court, I think it could be postponed to next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders hasn’t held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason.
Sanders responded that the rare press conferences were not due to a dislike of television journalists’ “demonstrative behavior,” although he shared: “I can’t say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior.”
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding, without citing evidence: “We’ve checked these statistics.”
“There will still be press conferences,” Sanders continued, “but if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and you have seen us practice it quite often in recent weeks, and that will replace press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and sometimes bizarre behavior in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Minister Addresses EU Workers at Scotland's National Health Service on Brexit Fears
The health minister wrote to EU staff working for Scotland’s National Health Service to express the country’s appreciation and willingness to remain in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the UK less than six months before it leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the exit have continued, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's meeting when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reid told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.
“He went to the sideline and somehow just fainted there,” Reid said.
Coaches and medical personnel fed Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was laid on a stretcher and taken to the locker rooms for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/severity of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a freshman with a college scholarship, is for his first season at Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Under new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will counteract the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of more than <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May is announcing a decision by foreign buyers to pay a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with additional income going to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenues supporting the government’s efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The addition – which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for donation – can amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects revenue to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13 percent of London’s newly built buildings are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to price hikes and making it harder for first-time buyers to intervene in the property market.
Many of the wealthy areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a cut in the stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by plundering land but not using it, and asked Ms May to abandon affordable housing quotas to repair Britain’s “disgraceful homes.”
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions “without guilt.”
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year, I shared that I would like to devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "greatest ambition" was to be a senior coach for Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish accepted the challenge to revive the club from northeast England, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, with three points from first place.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a game for the B team and that was it,” Ross told the BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with the Scottish games of Hampdon that my father and I watched as a child, so the national team always attracted me.
However, this opportunity would only open up if I had success at the club level.”
Among Ross's predecessors as managers of Sunderland were names such as Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Athletic's former mentor said he was not worried as the successor to such established names at a similar famous club, having previously rejected bids from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will be measured by a positive answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Because in terms of structure, base and conditions, it is undoubtedly at the level of the Premier League," he said.
“It will not be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can lead the team there again.”
Ross has been a manager for only three years, after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa avoid relegation to the Third Division and turned St. Mirren from a relegated team into a Champions League winner next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was really at a crossroads,” he recalls the time he took Aloa.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best job for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making good money, and I had some significant successes.
Being a player is hard sometimes.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still face the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I really do, I’ve never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire conscious life.”

The ideal time for a beer is 5:30pm on Saturdays, study reveals
The summer heat boosted the revenues of surviving British pubs, but accumulated more tension for restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Advisory, who compiled the statistics, said: “Due to prolonged sunny weather and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup, in July follows a similar pattern as in June, when pubs reported growth of 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and beverage bars reported the best results in their growth, compared with the downward movement of restaurants.
Pubs with meals also suffered from the sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped 6.6 percent in the month, while food declined 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, of RSM’s Recreation and Entertainment Analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the off-home services sector.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year can be particularly painful in addition to fixed costs.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food managers, and only the weather will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the much-desired rest.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.

One in Five Children Hide Secret Social Media Accounts From Their Parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study has revealed.
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows a rise in fake Insta pages
The news has raised fears that sexually explicit material is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “basic” profile to show to their parents
One in five children – some one in 11 – creates a social media account that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Insta accounts – a link to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has raised fears that sexually explicit material is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had cleared a “basic” profile to show to their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenage child who encouraged others to “rape him.”
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Aileen Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” on the Board of Athletics in Scotland
Aileen Doyle was elected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most accomplished athlete and chairman Ian Beatty has described the move as a great opportunity for those leading in the sport to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
“Aylid enjoys great respect in the athletics communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from attracting her,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to promote sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding four Olympic gold medals to his total, and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, lost the ability to walk after receiving a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved a full recovery, learned to walk again and today I am doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Ad for a breast pump that compares mothers with cows, split online reviews
A company that makes breastfeeding pumps has split online opinions with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows who are breastfeeding.
To commemorate the launch of the expected “world’s first wearable silent breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched a hilarious music-video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives nursing mothers to perform.
Four real mothers dance in a cowshed full of hay, against the background of a song with lyrics including: “Yes, I’m milking, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s not a udder, it’s my breasts.”
The chorus continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk your friends."
However, the ad posted on the company’s Facebook page caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it downplayed the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after they are born.”

Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breastfeeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “So inadequate advertising.”
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song “extremely funny.”
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accept it as it is.
“This product is brilliant,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who squeeze (often at their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not advertising praising or condemning the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they had danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who are breastfeeding feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and assembles discreetly in a breastfeeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside as they drain.
Anna Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding and lactating cows, we wanted to draw attention to breastfeeding and all the challenges associated with it, while at the same time showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Martha Jakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained children of migrants jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policy made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Typically, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who fear risking staying in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family would have to provide fingerprints, a data that would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the persons who are either guardians or family members of the guardians are staying illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals," Albens said.
In an effort to deal more quickly with the registration of these children, authorities imposed new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as the previous norm was, according to shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conferencing call rather than in person to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed unsuitable for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter officials and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said this concern is growing in large facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where signs that a child is having problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to the “tent city” without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could aggravate the trauma many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war has been going on for the eighth year.
Muallem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “the appropriate actions will be taken against them.”
"They should be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Muallem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until all Syrian lands are cleared” of both terrorist organizations and “any illegal presence of foreigners”.
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrians opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the lands of the war-ravaged country.
Regarding refugees, Muallem said the conditions were tolerable and could return, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading groundless fears" that pushed refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in these returns," he said.
“They are turning into a political issue something that is purely a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be provided to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib allowed for progress in political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
Muallem stressed, however, that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra front, who would be “destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene early meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft Syria’s post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the panel’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump won a second term
According to this logic, Trump will win re-election in the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, primetime ratings have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers at primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” topped the cable TV ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama The Last Candidate, which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, who is a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Mrs. Scovel told me that he replied, “Because it makes me laugh.”
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, Washington’s stories can determine Roe vs. Wade’s future, whether immigrant families can get back together, and the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to watching a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book Fear; Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather pilot jacket ("arrogance-stuffed garment" according to the Washington Post's The Washington Post's "Yes," and "Street of Describing"), and the "Street of Describing."

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny, 80 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he had locked himself up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the television, especially when Brett Kavanaugh had to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
“I remember a time when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Investments pour into the most contested race in the snap election for a seat in Congress
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th District receives a stream of money thanks to the rearrangement of congressional districts and hence two holders for the same seat.
Pittsburgh’s recently redistributed suburban county cites conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another county in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faces another holder, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th county, which significantly overtook the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that old counties were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely debated partial elections in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the county by 20 points.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.
U.S. Considers Imposing Sanctions on El Salvador Over Its Support for China, Then Withdraws
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were envisaged only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. drug aid for development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be agonizing for the Central American country with its unemployment rate and homicide rate.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being that served to continue a similar gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent an influx of migrants into the United States.
But by mid-September, the top governing bodies said they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now, Vice President Mike Pence has announced he will attend a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats said.
All three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also asked to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move could be Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, a report that is now significant evidence in the public register.
It is alleged that Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign to attack our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to that body just as he prepares to face voters, and perhaps a jury made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I am not suggesting that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – or that of others like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make those choices that will affect how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d’état against Hitler, as long as the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of slaughter.
The course of history depends on such pivotal moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
At the moment, Americans are faced with several such milestones.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculated that he was unfit for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story in The Times was inaccurate.
“How are we going to react if the new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh requested by the FBI is not complete or fair – or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
Above all, will we vote in the early congressional election if it forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of it.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Shabbat candles on that table, wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorance of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month would give them a significant chance to move forward from Group D of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorance from playing his first game of the season before the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that for the Rangers this result could become a springboard to greater achievements.
“We won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game hoping we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall, the draw seems fair.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second.
We look forward to Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can give our best and achieve a good result.
“Last year was definitely tough after everything that happened with my injuries and changes at the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team is good and the guys are really having fun, the workouts are fruitful.
I hope that we will be able to use all our strength to forget last season and achieve the desired success.”
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
Approximately half of the Nationwide survey participants said they discussed long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent have talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven’t taken the steps to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t declare your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions when choosing a long-term care financial institution may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own funds – if you have the cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the very beginning.
Appoint a health care attorney so that you have a specific trustee to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals take into account your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial commissioner.
You can choose a trustee to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical care and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Put these details in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors will be,” Martin asks.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

His injuries are not life-threatening and police are trying to draw witnesses.
Category: Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications, aid organizations are unable to obtain information from the Dongala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu since the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
A tsunami struck the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Ring of Fire" and is regularly mowed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a 10-meter tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in a stalemate.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on violent charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and resistance to arrest, according to a report by Alaska State Police released on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and under unsecured $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded “innocent, for sure” when asked to plead, the media reported.
Palin faces a penalty for three Class A offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offense, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a domestic violence crime, and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the quake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social networks that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami wave hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October attack on a bicycle lane near the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, gazing at pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to a notification of intent in connection with the death penalty application filed in the Southern District, New York.
According to the court document, both charges could result in a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, an expanded federal court filed 22 indictments against Saipov, including eight murder-related racketeering charges commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “serious planning and deliberation,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s conduct as “horrible, cruel and perverse.”
Saifulo Khabibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Laury Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Hernan Felucci and Alejandro Damian Panuco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last time the Southern District of New York sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was executed in New York City was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek national, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“In our view, the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a guilty sentence and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutor’s office not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Talks
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the army of the people” today, during a protest at a Conservative conference.
The former leader of Britain’s Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” – as one of the members of May’s own party suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain “would have left by now” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces to settle with the deeply divided ranks of the party has been highlighted by conservatives who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromise plan Chequers, despite attacks from Brexit supporters, supporters of staying and from the EU.
Allies insist it will make progress in trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions, and insist that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr Bonn told protesters with the slogan “Exit means exit” in Solihull that he wanted to “throw away the Chequers”.
He pointed out that Mr Farage should have participated on an equal footing with the others and that he should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have left by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to abandon the Chequers plan.
Speaking of his opposition to the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight in world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bonn rejected allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The notion that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative spokeswoman Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists who actually took to the streets and really helped us get elected.
Please drop "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should “feel the pressure” if they intend to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
“It’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to change Brexit, and we’re here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, supporters of the stay went on a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A handful of activists had hoisted flags that read “Conservatives Against Brexit” after the start of the group this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the party’s security concerns when he opened up at the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can deploy Canada’s IT systems and all the technology and more, and more, for unhindered border crossing, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren says he will "seriously consider" his candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe said the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future at a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Jeff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she could take the Trump presidency in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th voters' meeting at the mayor's office since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was high time “women went to Washington and repaired our damaged government, and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest made for Sims' death at LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect arrested in the shooting on Friday when basketball player Wade Simms from LSU was killed.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
They posted video footage of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Simms, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the Southern University area early Friday morning.
“Wade Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, holding a gun, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was seamlessly arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> youth who grew up in Baton Rouge – Simms participated in 32 games with 10 titles last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 fights per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after the instructions of the team helped him defeat Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two corners, thus allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first made a pit-stop and left Hamilton to deal with the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be decisive for the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit-stop on the next lap and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton managed to overtake him after a bold maneuver and a "rubber-to-rubber" ride, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly release the inside of the runway to avoid a penalty with added time after he had already closed the road to his opponent with a double-cross.
At the top of his 21st birthday Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
After that, he even led for quite a long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly overtake Kimi Raikkonen in the battle for fourth place.
He finally entered for a pit-stop in lap 44, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day because Valteri did a great job all weekend and showed up as a real gentleman when he let me get ahead of him.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first two places on the podium,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her claim that she did not distribute the letter from Christine Blazy Ford, accusing Supreme Court contender Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “bad and disgusting and dishonest.”
“What can happen and what’s good that happens in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil and disgusting and insincere,” he said.
“When you look at publications and distributions, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You know what I mean?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread it?
Do you remember her answer... Did you play the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we have disseminated... No, we have not disseminated,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September – but Feinstein denies that the spread occurred from her office.
“I didn’t cover up Ford’s claims, I didn’t spread her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it as confidential as she wanted.”
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court contender accused of sexual misconduct against three women, the president pointed out that Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
“Look at the dishonor, the shamelessness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars returned for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, winning the rematch in Dundee by 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants led early in the match with two goals after hitting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilliers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney tied for the hosts before Dwyer regained the Giants lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals solidified their victory.
This is the third win in the Elite League for the Adam Keefe boys, who got out of the bottom to beat Dundee in Belfast with 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The shot that Dwyer found the score came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 assisted by Kendall McFowl, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance, assisting Beauvilliers four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants lead before the first break, scoring a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the odds with a powerful kick in the door at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time this game in the end of the second half, as he gave his best and consolidated the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who have lost the last four games in a total of five games, are hosting the Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight manager has been killed to make sure hundreds of people aboard a plane can escape an earthquake.
A flight manager in Indonesia has been praised as a hero after being killed, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
Strong aftershocks continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the highly shaken control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Control Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong was restricted.
“We assume that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the debris and many people cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There's looting everywhere in the supermarkets."
Ian Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been reported missing after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said it had been unable to contact a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were admitted to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane went very low.
“That’s great,” says Janes.
Janes says that he and the others managed to run through the deep to the waist water to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy says sailors repairing a nearby dock also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to take people to shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters of deep water.
Data from the Safer Airline Network show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered flights over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of the cases.
Analyst lays out the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office closed its statement on the case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town on that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said “that’s a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said she knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis deleted text messages, calls and her contact information from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to evoke negative opinions about the genre by performing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argue that hip-hop has deviated from its origins of political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and promote the conscience of hip-hop again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are revived in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York nanny sues couple after dismissal for ‘racist’ message
A New York-based nanny is suing a couple for being fired for discrimination after receiving a wrongly sent message from her mother, who complains she’s “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was stunned to learn that the new nanny, Gisele Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing her mistake, the “embarrassed” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, arguing that the previous nanny, who was an African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipina.
Mrs. Morris was paid a day's work and then sent home by taxi.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, demanding the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract she was originally hired for, even though she had no contract.
“I want to show them, look, you shouldn’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “You’re sure that’s discrimination.”
In response to the lawsuit, the couple claimed they were not racists, adding that Morris’ termination of employment was a reasonable move, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after having offended her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Comparing the claim to “blackmail”, Plasco claims that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Are you going to attack someone like that?
That's not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still pending, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and their logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not feel connected to a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, relates about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s released.
It’s a lot of fun now that we’re aware of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, would feel optimistic about the book's eventual rejection, adding that he was celebrating the 60th anniversary of the book's publication "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family,” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
“He was a very humble man and he wasn’t boastful,” she said.
“But because you felt Paddington so real, it’s like having a child who has accomplished something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your doing.
I think he kind of took Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and a product of his imagination, he always attributed the merits of Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad kept calling to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn’t expect to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperousse.
“Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by her doctors to support her heart slowly cease to work and leave her system.
She's gone a while before that, and that's how it's all over.
I had to just sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get over it.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperousse, who is still grieving the loss of her daughter, boards the plane with the other passengers who have no idea of the trial she is going through.
“Nobody understood,” she said.
“I kept my head down and my tears dripped all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of empathy with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Women Put Up Postcards to Prevent Bridge Suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis' son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, from Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminates every room.
However, he gave up his job before he left, and was in a “truly dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences.”
Mrs. Davis creates the postcards “so that people know they have someone to go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, loses Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas - when the children opened their gifts, he neither looked at them nor did anything."
She said it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “It opens a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question after FBI opens investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wants – a limited-length and limited-range investigation – maybe we could join forces,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “disintegrating” despite the hardened over-party blockade.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the moment itself.
Early elections are just five weeks away, on November 6 — if Republicans are not performing well, as expected, their attempts to elect their representative in the country’s highest court will be seriously hurt.
George W. Bush called senators, inviting them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and with his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There is no official comment from Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korean refugees eventually acquire citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal migrants rather than refugees, often forcibly repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on stagnation in nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to basically work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way we will be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Congressional minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had reacted that way, she would have been called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and moving when discussing his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on the individual” orchestrated by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court because it has become clear that he is biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and the way he persecutes the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi denied it when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s unfit not only to go to the Supreme Court, but to the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential rulings regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t it great,’” Pelosi said.
Women also need to be controlled.
This is a valid criticism, after months and years of rage spreading, and she cannot accept it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “I got tremendous help from a woman who was a CEO somewhere who shared that she cried when she got angry too, but developed her technique so that when she got angry and cried, she said to her interlocutor, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought that was genius.”
Tears are allowed in an expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how once, as I groaned in unspeakable rage, an older woman grabbed me by the neck – a chilling manager I had always been a little afraid of – and she dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they did it to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congressman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a yacht called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was to have one more.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As she enters late into the campaign, she lags behind on fundraising and decides that she will not stay in the race if she fails to raise $2 million.
The battle is doomed to failure.
She realizes that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would give only $250 to her.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was overwhelmed with so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and be able to turn to voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism that made her upset.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the media reacted.
“Some may think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
“Did she cry?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Serve Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is only gaining momentum, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning salvo this year by taxing key elements of China’s exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in output, effectively taxing half of all U.S. imports from China.
Each time, Beijing retaliated with new tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against every U.S. strike, and the world’s second-largest economy is not expected to ignore this soon.
To force Washington to give up is to yield to the demands, but to lower one’s head publicly in front of Washington would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
Still, experts say if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure from the trade war with the US could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, Asia-related research fellow at the Center for a New American Security Expert Group.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by the terrorists in order to return them to their normal state.
All conditions are now in place for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional aid or aid from countries that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, overtaking the US team with an end result of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has suffered six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown in the tournament after the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the necessary 14.5 points, which guaranteed victory over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who performed poorly during most of the tournament, threw his first blow to the 16th hole (with a "pair" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has performed excellently in all rounds, becoming one of four players in the history of the tournament to reach a 5-0-0 balance since the race was held in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Speight lost categorically by 5&4 from the player in the team of Europe, which is in the lowest place in the rankings – Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
World leader Dustin Johnson lost by 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, for whom this is probably the last participation of the “Ryder Cup”.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participations in the Ryder Cup, became the European with the most points in the tournament ever, increasing his assets this year to 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can raise the bowl again.
The most important thing is the team and I am happy that I was able to help," Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ramm, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on the singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play,” Ram, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and his total Ryder Cup balance is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistic about one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles – an indicator by which he is second only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team experienced difficulties throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finow, who showed high-class golf on all days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furik said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we were pushing the team of Europe.
There was a fight.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players performed very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Association of Professional Golfers and our Ryder Cup Committee and look only forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There is no way not to take off the hat of the enemy.
We were just played."
