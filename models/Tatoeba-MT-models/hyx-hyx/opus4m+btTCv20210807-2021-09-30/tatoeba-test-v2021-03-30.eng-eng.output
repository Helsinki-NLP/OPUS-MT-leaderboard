Tom said that Mary knew that she was required to do that.
That's the smart thing to do.
I think Tom will listen to me.
What I vowed is not wrong.
Tom said that he thought it might happen in Boston too.
I don't think anyone can't stop Tom.
I want to know if Tom and Mary need to do that too.
I suspect Tom and Mary are exhausted.
The world isn't as scary as you think.
I think Tom is deranged.
I know you don't want to do that, but you need:
Let's hope that's enough time.
Tom is one of the ugliest people that I know.
I'm very glad to see you.
I don't think anyone suspected you're Tom.
Put on your socks quickly. We're late.
Tom told everyone that he was starved.
Tom told me he knew how to speak French.
I'm absolutely sure that Tom was wrong.
I think I'd give it another try.
I think it's strange that Tom'sn't at Mary's party.
Tom told me that Mary is unbiased.
I don't think you've left early.
Tom said, Mary's, of course, can't be able to do that.
Tom said, “It isn’t possible for Mary to do this again.”
I have no idea you know Tom.
We will later discuss this problem: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and
I don't think Tom has anybody to help him.
How is it going?
Tom thinks that he can do what he wanted.
I know that I can't do that as well as Tom can.
I know that Tom is planning to do that tomorrow.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be interested.
It is especially hot today.
I'm not as successful as Tom.
Tom said that he doesn't think he can do that kind of thing.
If you don't go, I won't either.
What are your plans?
Tom and Mary say they're ready to go.
I know that Tom doesn't know that I don't do that.
Tom thought that Mary likes her:
Tom said he did nothing illegal.
Tom said that he already did.
I think you're going to be OK.

The computer has stopped working.
We know that you aren't stupid.
She doesn't turn up after all.
We both know that's a lie.

I don't think Tom would be awake at this time of night.
I don't think Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that:
I don't think Tom is in Australia now.
I don't think Tom knew exactly what he had to do.
Both Tom and Mary can do this:
I think you may know.
Tom's flaky.
It's always easy to face reality.
Tom says he won't win.
Tom knew that they were following him.
What is the դժոխք that is supposed to mean?
I know I'm in great trouble now.
Why do you never do what I tell you to do?
Tom decided the best thing to let Mary go to Australia.
Tom's ever done that, if Mary asked him not.
I think you said you're interested.
It's harder to do that than Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom will be going to Australia with Mary.
I'm so tired.
I'm 18 years old.
They're not coming.
Tom probably doesn't yet know the rules.
Let's hope you're cured.
I know somebody should do that.
I can't speak French as well as you.
You've heard Tom more carefully.

What’s your favorite fast-food restaurant?

It's not open for debate.
Tom told everyone that he was unemptyed.
I know that's hard to do.
How are you planning to do that?
It's beyond me.
I am a bit out of shape!
Haven't you know that Tom is seeing someone else?
It's hard to find somebody to replace Tom.
I must be more careful:
Tom and Mary thought that they were cute.
I think you have learned that by now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom is just as smart as Mary.
They wished that they hadn't said it.
I wonder whether Tom is planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that he hoped in Mary was motivated to do that.
I'm going crazy.

Hope I get a chance to go to Boston.

Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid.
I know that Tom knew that I was planning to do that.
You've been able to do that much better.
We work every day, but Monday.
I know you aren't the ones who did it.
Tom said he did not have the power to stop it.
I know that Tom and Mary are married.
I've been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I think you are excited that I'm getting married.
Tom told me he'd likely cry.
I think they'd find someone else.
I'm the only one there, who knows that Tom doesn't want to do that.
In fact, I have always felt that I had a good relationship with Jehovah.
I figured you may be busy now.
Tom said he thought that we had to do this by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I think it's unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wanted to do today.
Tom said something else about that.
Tom admitted he wasn't brave.
I know I've done that.
Tom said he did not want to stay in Boston any longer.

Tom doesn't think we'll find anybody who can do that for us.
He avoided his eyes:
Tom isn't as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by ourselves.
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
I thought Tom should be mistaken.

They said they like this:
Tom is the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I've introduced myself.
Tom said Mary was looking forward to retirement.
I can’t recall when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about it.
Tom is liked by everyone.
I don't think anyone thought you're crazy.
He hasn't got a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said to Mary that John might be allowed to do this himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.

I'm not hurt anybody.
We can't play Baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.

Where did you learn to do that?

Tom said he's willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary already has a driver's license.

Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.

I knew Tom, ամենայն հավանականությամբ, that was the case:
Tom said that he didn't know that Mary's can't speak French too well.
I don't think there's any chance that I'll get there on time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.

If Tom did this, I would too.
I know that Tom is still in his office.

I wonder whether Tom was alive.
I might try to borrow a htchet from Tom.

I can’t recall anything else at the time:
Tom needs to know that somebody cares:

How much did you spend per day when you were in Australia?
Hope I'm able to do that.

I don't think anyone was satisfied.
It looks like someone has ripped a page out of this book.

Tom may be desperate.
The road parallels the river.

I'm afraid I can't help you.
I know I'm not alone.
They're not as innocent as they seem.
We do not have snow here.
I don't think Tom would help us do that.
Tom said Mary is probably still heartbroken.
They may do that if they want:
I know that Tom is a very shy boy.
Tom knew that I was angry.
