If I have money, I'll buy this computer immediately.
If it's not for the storm, I'd come sooner.
If it's okay for her to buy a knife, then why on earth can't I?
If it's something you can do, do it.

If it is possible, someone would do it by now:
If I were you, I'd ask Tom to help.
If I were you, I'd quit.
If I were you, I would call the doctor.
If I were you, I would once go home.
If I were you, I wouldn't eat any of the spoons that Tom picked.
