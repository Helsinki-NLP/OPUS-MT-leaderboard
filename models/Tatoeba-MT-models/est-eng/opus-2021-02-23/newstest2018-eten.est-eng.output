Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the postimees, the police in Spain detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
Suspectedly, they are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal community aged 27 to 57, who are mainly involved in drug offences.
In Mijas, Malaga, Spain, the alleged leader of a criminal organisation was detained.
In Estonia, three men were detained as suspects, one of them is reported to be the leading figure of a criminal organisation, and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles of the criminal organisation were clearly divided.
The aim of the criminal association's action was to commit drug offences and thereby earn proceeds", commented the Head of the Pre-trial Criminal Procedure, State Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this case", added the prosecutor.
These are people who have previously been in the interest of law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation", commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said that detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation of nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work materialised and we stopped suspecting crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
Leis added that the officers of the Central Criminal Police were instrumental in apprehension in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian guard.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that, while at large, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the Prosecutor's Office applied for their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain awaits his surrender to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized in order to secure confiscation in this criminal case.
The pre-trial criminal proceedings are conducted by the Office for Organised Crimes of the Central Criminal Police and headed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion in 2005 and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered to be the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia, after Nikolai Tarankov, then underworld leader.
Gulevitch from Kemerovo emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes in various hotels and charged monthly roofing taxes to businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds from crime and judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the so-called eight defendants of the so-called Dikayev criminal community from whom the proceeds of the crime were confiscated to EUR 80 000, or the judgment against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov established in 2006 a criminal organisation aimed at the illegal trafficking of illegal cigarettes and the commission of crimes involving trafficking in human beings in Ida-Virumaa and South Estonia.
Confiscated proceeds from crime amount to nearly 71 500 euros.
In these cases, the fact that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and, if necessary, act together in any country of the European Union has ensured success.
Civil rights group warns against travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri about state discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The Group's statement states: "The NAACP Travel Note issued for the state of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and Missouri to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the state, given the dubious race-based events that have recently taken place all over the state and have been brought out here."
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning, both by the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win cases involving discrimination, and by the fact that the State's law enforcement targets are unequally largely targeted by minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the side of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said President Rod Chapel of the NAACP Missouri branch to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had complaints this close before."
This is the first warning issued by the organization about the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults to black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died half this year under dubious circumstances after he ran out of gas driving through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the remark refers to a recent report by the Prosecutor General of Missouri, which shows that in the state, black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
"The note is intended to make people aware and warn their families, friends and workmates about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they pass through the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state in 16th place in the state's cross-section in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to the new Missouri Act, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Association (American Civil Liberties Union ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws which obliged local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, as according to ACLU this increases racial profiling.
Usually, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA.
Hepatitis: What can anyone know about the various forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which may progress to cirrhosis, or liver wrinkles, and liver cancer, are at a disadvantage.
Health Board Epidemiology Advisor Kutsar says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease is also the popular name of inflammation of the liver yellowing.
In children, hepatitis may go on without signs or symptoms.
Different types of inflammation of the liver can only be identified from laboratory test data.
Acute hepatitis may turn into chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without any signs of illness, which means that a person may not know about his or her dangerous liver disease.
Kutsar of the moon outlines various forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from the sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, sex, from the infected person’s stools to the hands and hands of food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth, and using drugs.
The risk group of hepatitis A infection includes family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with an infected person, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people who are travelling very much and who are at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before use.
Hepatitis B viruses spread through contact with the blood of a person who is suffering from the disease, drug injection, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated household articles (dental brushes, shavings), donor blood, sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a foetus/infants.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns, sick family members and carers of the infected mother, health care workers, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other body fluids, and travellers visiting countries with a high infection of hepatitis B.
In particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk as well as people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures against hepatitis B include: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharps and needle-to-sticks, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms in cases of infectious sex or the prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B in Estonia is part of the national immunisation programme and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted by contact with human blood, drug injection, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated household items, donor blood, sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a foetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns, sick family members and carers of the infected mother, health care workers, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other body fluids, HIV infected persons and travellers visiting countries with a high infection of hepatitis C.
Preventive measures against hepatitis C include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharps and needle-to-sticks, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms in cases of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection is present in combination with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses spread through sexual contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringes and needles, and rarely from the infected mother to the foetus.
Patients at risk for hepatitis D are chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus and those who are not immune to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is the vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people against infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses spread fecal-oral via drinking water and food, including low-temperature beef, fish and clams, donated blood, shared syringes and from the infected mother to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high levels of illness.
Prevention measures for hepatitis E include hygiene: wash or disinfect your hands after using the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the patient.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating undercooked beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption.
Although on the last round, competitors tried to push four times the Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end of the line and won in 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, pulling his wife, Tania, and his children along after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
It was wonderful to be on the track with them," Farah told the journalists.
Farah is aiming at 5,000 and 10,000 meters of golden doubles in London for the fifth prize in a row.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait, an extraordinary story" dives much deeper into the cultural life of Vienna at the end of the 19th and early 20th century.
But even more deeply into history.
The awe - inspiring amount of information could have been useful, i.e. the louder cut-off axe, the narrower theme allowed more access to the portrait allowed in the title on an extraordinary story.
It is as if there were two books between some of the covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in the painting by Gustav Klimt and her Daam in Gold, and a much more extensive and comprehensive history book about the respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the bubbling cultural life of Vienna, and who himself ended up in the capital of Austria, can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life was going around Ringstra or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the name you know in the book, you feel a little more cultured.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where there was a proliferation of incurable syphilis and the highest level of suicides in Europe, as if there was nothing to add to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, any paired brush stroke adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had increased exponentially, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
During the turn of the century, nearly one in ten inhabitants of Vienna were Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open up the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt's famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele's whole glamorous life she belonged to didn't pull.
When you look at Lady in Gold, it's hard to believe that at the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife's portrait from Klimt, the hottest painter in Vienna was the last moment.
Klimt's order at the time cost 4000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a land house with a good location.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of the master's love affair with a model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist from the work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Daam in gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the start of his work with Adele, Klimt had visited Ravenna in San Vitale's basilica, and researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics of Empress Theodora that had been seen there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his Lady in Gold in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (in 1907-1908), another golden painting called Kiss was born.
Art historians did not miss the resemblance of two women.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
"I think that in memory of my friend Klimt I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished their family Klimt's collection to go to the museum.
Six years before he died, Klimt had another portrait of Adele.
In his will (Adele left in February 1925) he also asked his wife to leave two portraits of him and four landscape paintings of Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
Her jewelry was passed on to her nieces, Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get into the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed to draw.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be a reason for not being accepted by Jewish professors at the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in the will, had changed considerably by 1939 - it was important to find works that were acceptable to the Nazi party from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Hitler’s personal art store was also suited to some of Adele’s work at home, but not Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year litigation started between the Austrian Government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauer.
It is only to be noted here that if the Kisses are seen in the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer's Lady's Gold must be seen in the New York Neue Galerie.
And before you go to Vienna, read the book above.
Even if you don't plan to go to Klimt's work, at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish stuff after the book closed than the 135 million-dollar painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a family fate story - and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree mentioned at the beginning of the book made it easier to navigate the events.
A 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
Gold was very close to the personal record of his 200-metre swim. 2.16.62.
The top mark dates back to 17 years of age when the Canadian Junior Championship was 21.658.
Gold was the last one to get to the A-Final, maybe the tenth.
In the final he passed the distance of 2.15.76 and gained a good seventh place with a powerful new top stamp.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15.13) left Gold to divorce for just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time rankings, Gold became third and his new personal top brand is the fifth result of all-time Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still taking off at the Canadian Adult Championships at 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in free swimming and 200 m and 400 m in complex swimming.
Last week, a Canadian Junior Championship took place in Toronto, and Gold took successful launchs there.
He won a 200-foot free-floating silver medal in 2.03.22.
This is how fast this distance was floated by an Estonian woman last year in 2008.
Only Elina Partyka, the Estonian record woman, has swam this distance in Estonia faster than Gold.
The Estonian woman living in Canada also won a bronze medal in 100 m free-floating with an excellent personal record and the top stamp of the new Estonian season 56.66.
For example, a year older than him, Kertu Ly Alnek, has swam this distance only one century faster.
He reached the top of his personal stamp when he received the time 1.03.69 in the opening of the flood.
At half the distance, he won the seventh place when he swam in the finals 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season ranking in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth.
It's vacation time, which means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
Since Trump has so far been one of the presidents who took out the most vacation days, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at a golf club named Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's holiday began yesterday, the opponents of Trump have been speaking about the holiday for a week.
They blame Trump for too much rest.
It is the President’s custom to spend weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196th day of office.
For example, George W. Bush had been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama did half as much as Trump, only 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things quickly.
Within days of becoming president, Trump said on "60 minutes" that there would be no time for long vacations during his term of office, as much needs to be done.
He also complained three years ago about Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, plays golf, goes to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS chops heads off journalists".
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not exactly a relaxation.
Rather, it is officially called a leave of work, during which Trump does not have time for reading or other pleasure activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for the holiday.
In fact, in the west wing of the White House, the air conditioning system is replaced and therefore all personnel had to leave.
The Oval Office and other office rooms of the President are also located in the West Wing.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August if it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, a spokesman at the White House, who stressed that the president would continue to work on vacation.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the state office if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew a lot about the unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take the newspapers long to beat him up for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Criticism naturally upset him.
But he didn't force his critics to shut up.
Because in 1783 Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken away from us, and in silence and muteness we may be led to slaughter like sheep".
It brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work harder to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And by the beginning of the week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU.
The governor's office branded the case void, and the web commentaries were full of counter-reactions in the style of "Who cares?"
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But that's what matters.
And it really matters when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
It's an amazingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His acceptance rate is second best among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a thoughtless reacting hothead.
He has led the state with a firm hand and has remained firmly committed to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook rather skillfully as the main tool for communicating with his constituents, presenting his bald head, for example, for the first time after chemotherapy.
Thus, the Governor's page, which is a public forum with official markings, which manages the blocking of people visiting taxpayers' dollar-paid staff, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the behaviour of the governor, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderator.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of online railing trolls, spam mailers or angry people.
The Post was talking to several real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are real people who communicate with their elected leaders, a teacher, a company owner and a pastor, not Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not obscene.
In his post, the pastor quoted the Bible, emphasising the Catholicism of Hogan.
A lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, didn't incite Sharma Raman, but a real hate crime.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed because he had not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post news report in the commentary country.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject, some call it an indifferent collective effort rather than admit that it is a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack", others would probably call "public support."
The Facebook age makes it easy to match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when workers had to be expelled to do the same so that they would collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest protestors and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for teething Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been suing Twitter users who are blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first symbolic judgments on the subject was given last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Attorney James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter's Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, affordable postal charges had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers smashed his leadership.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Yuricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents collected in the context of the web-based George Washington mail collection project, his office was buried in petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain.
But he didn't force them to keep quiet.
Freedom of expression, differences of opinion and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for homeland comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European top number Ronan Rafferty hopes for home territory comfort in the next three days when the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses will take place on 25th Scottish Senior Open.
The Northernerman, who was leading the last round of the archerfield Links trails in the neighbourhood last year before the fall to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and performs the role of ambassador to the tournament instead of founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw the Renaissance Club built, and now we see how the club shines in full glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"Gamers see the path in its best form, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry's done a great job of building this place.
He's a keen supporter of the golf game, and he's proud of what he's done here.
It allows the trail to be presented perfectly."
An Englishman, Eales, eagerly awaits the first time he can defend the championship, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This is accompanied by a very special feeling," said a player nesting in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my title as Extremadura Open because it was taken out of my winning calendar a year later.
It's magical to come back to this area.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year. For me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts."
Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour in the early part of the year when he was 50, will return to the competition again on the ground.
This is his first event in Scotland after the participation of Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"To play at home is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra tension.
I've enjoyed playing again a lot, and I've shown you a pretty decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things are going so far."
The Trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain Sam Torrance of Ryder's Cup are two of the six Scots in the race, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge and parking a car with one passenger costs a car with 5 pounds and a car with two or more passengers with 10 pounds.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s Golden Land
If Bardina's cooking Dege's dinner, she won't use the stove.
He even rarely uses pots.
In a wooden cabin in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai Regent of Papua Province, Indonesia, the housewife places the sweet potatoes called nota in local language directly on the scene of fire.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the fire and eaten eagerly with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor with no furniture, and she also does her daily chores there, such as washing her laundry with cloudy water from a nearby sex.
The toilet's role is filled with a bucket in a roofless room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she is not assigned to care for any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to visit after 5:00 in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse into the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was merged under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that caused controversy, in which only 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote under the eyes of the Occupant forces.
The movement, which incites the Dutch people to free themselves from domination, quickly turned its rage against the Jakarta government, which still holds the region under its strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Paapua and Western Paapua, so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a remote and deserted place. To get here, you have to fly 90 minutes from Jayapura, the capital of the province, to Nabire, and then take a five-hour journey that makes the rental car nauseous.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has changed the shades to yellowish brown.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, not to mention journalists, nor have foreigners come here at all.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago’s paapua worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, referring to her colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before we wore only plant leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics being one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also a gold-rich country in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153 000 inhabitants in New Jersey, is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted some USD 3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be proud of its wood resources, estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of the suffering of the poppies, for they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study of The New York Times showed that Freeport paid local military and military units approximately USD 20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 to one officer.
The efforts of the poppies to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are dealt with inexorably.
Human rights activists say that more than 500,000 paapua have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing in the highlands belonging to the Papuan tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, over 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
The 2016 report of the archbishop of Birsbane, "We lose everything", contains testimony to the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (a second report says that rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful protests.
"The number of victims is difficult to count, because such incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws are even tighter closed because the natural resources of Papua have caused the influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demography is changing, as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the numerous islands of Java, Kalimantani, Sumatra and Sulawesi in Indonesia.
The home canteens of the Javans sell a gado gado with crisp chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper than local paapua on the traditional market," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province.
"The paapus paapua mama-mamas [women] therefore lose their market share."
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, known to the people as Jokowi, promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Paapua in his election campaign in 2014.
Former carpenter won 27 of Papua 29 electoral districts on his way to the Jakarta Presidential Palace, including Paniai.
But the Paapua has changed very little, and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation of fulfilling our hopes for restoring justice," says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was downgraded.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs at the fire in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from darkness.
Frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, drunk soldiers chased children and beat them with their rifle handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young men, women, and children from Papua gathered for justice at a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance of the Paapua honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and imitated the bird song.
Some protestors started throwing stones at the police and military.
"If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," said the official document of the magazine TIME, but has not been issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the mayor of Kego Koto district of the city of Enarotal, perceived the threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one had the will to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he said to Time magazine on his brightly colored tree house porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers gathered.
"There was a lot of people, there were plenty of shots," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was shot three times by a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I came to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said TIME magazine, Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of the Papuan police told the reporters that he was only responsible for the security of his department because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened to be killed," said Commissar Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papuan police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many were injured.
The news of the killings did not arrive in Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura gave a passionate speech, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and promising to deal with abuse in Paapua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Wiranto, said that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the crimes against human rights that have taken place.
But almost immediately, excuses followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
When speaking to the Time magazine on 5 June in Jakarta, however, Wiranto withdrew his words by saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints in Paapua.
Instead, he said that "all things will be settled by law".
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1000 people in East Timor during the bloody referendum on independence in 1999, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Paapua, including what happened in Pania.
The families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim distrust.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the belief that the people of Paniai are afraid to dissect this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after helping to bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the Paniai neighbourhood of Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when they got into an affair between the villagers and the manager of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s office on the construction site.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at policemen, and the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to the locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesia militaryized Police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we were afraid of revenge," said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii of TIME magazine, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the incarceration of the injured.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the discontent of the honey, mon, dan, and Damal tribes living in the greening highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papuan Movement (VPL) in an army of rebels, which, according to them, defends the rights of the Paapua by occasional attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "defence of state sovereignty", the military has arrested Paniis over the last few years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as the "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
The lack of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as unattainable.
People grow all their food mainly in sweet potatoes, along with some fruit and vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest being sold on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In time, economic disparities between the indigenous paapates and the new migrants who have arrived to a large extent since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport have deepened.
These few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
The Papuans themselves often lack the capital or skills needed to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Paapua.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on foreign media.
Towards the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow the relevant practices", although they had been given a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asia Department of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s election promises have not been implemented to remove restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development.
"In Indonesia, journalists from the most turbulent provinces of Papua in the east and from West Papua are threatened with new threats to rejecting the visa and blacklisting," he said in his statement.
The absence of the press's drilling eye means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to close neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states in Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "multiple crimes" in Paapua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically also supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dismissed the group's accusations by telling journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still democratic order and freedom of the press, so that the evidence of anti-human rights cases would be difficult to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to notice.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands, headed by the national human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to the source who had attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the paapoos do not believe that they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a well-meaning man, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants to tell Jokow that not only do the people of Pania continue to live under the threat of a predatory army, but they are struggling with poor educational and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like other poppies, consider their voice given to Jokow to be a debt that he will have to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims managed to cope with the last symbolic rebellion they buried the body of one of the victims in a police station and a land opposite the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
The Dubai Torch skyscraper was swallowed by fire for the second time.
Fire swooped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee this 337-metre-high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has devastated a high - construction building that happens to be called the Torch, or Torch Tower, in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct causes of fire were reported.
"We slept and woke up to a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident to Reuters who called himself George.
According to Dubai’s civil defence officials, firefighters extinguished the flame at about 4 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions around the world about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high-rise buildings.
In the course of the investigation carried out by the Torch Board following the fire in 2015, it was found that the most damage suffered was the decorative panels and insulation of the facades - external surface.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of Grenfell Tower and facade panels in London could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Look, these phones are probably gonna be a salesman in the fall.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came for sale in spring, and new hit phones are also expected in autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, the marketing and sales director of Tele2, this year’s flagships are characterised by an innovative design, an iris scanner, an edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and an ultra-fast processor.
Samsung Galaxy S8 created great excitement in the world of technology, which has also reached the top of the Estonian Smartphones Sales Table.
Autumn allows even more rapid charging, more durable battery, better quality camera and greater water and dust resistance for those interested in crying.
He added that on the basis of the rumors, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict the four top models that are likely to take over this year's sales charts.
These four top models of smartphones will still reach the supermarkets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the supermarkets as early as mid-September.
Rumors of what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it spreads a lot.
While iPhone 7 did not lead to significant differences compared to iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday expects the new model to be completely different from the previous ones.
Four colours have been spoken: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple's design manager JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model look like smooth glass.
The ceramic version of iPhone has also been mentioned.
In addition to the eye iris scanner, wireless charging and even more high-quality camera, you can expect faster A11 processor.
I'm sure it's one of the most anticipated smart phones of the year.
The pre-ordering of the brand-new Galaxy Note 8 starts on August 23rd.
There's been a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 looks like.
From what I hear, more is meant for a business user and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a TV lens with a narrower vision.
At present, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable in quality to iPhone 8.
But we're looking forward to August 23rd.
Although this year Nokia has launched three smartphones headed by Nokia 6, there is still a lack of their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be presented already on 16 August.
We expect from Nokia a 5.3-inch-to-edge screen and a high-speed Qalcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia’s new model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by Zeiss.
If Sony’s specific flagship has so far been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future with even more innovative features.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but with at least the same good or better camera.
Sony's new model has been speculated to have a screen of at least six inches.
What reality brings, we will see very soon, because traditionally Sony has released its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to the leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post published transcripts of phone calls between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump made a telephone call to the Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to stop public witnessing that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States scolded him for public condemnation, saying, "You can't tell the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that he would make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing an intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on the refugees going to Australia was "creepy", "fouly" and "fooly". He claimed that the agreement that was made during Obama's government would make him look like a "dover" because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump hung up by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not discuss the complaint by OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the purchase of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an decree that rejected the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Lines in the Tartu bus procurement, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is the procurement of public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court the judgment of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not decide to deal with it.
Although in social media many complain that Weekend’s noise from the festival disturbs their night and the whole town is full of drunken partyers, there are also many who have no bad words to say about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the store was so polite!
I didn't see any blurry or rudeness.
Even I saw kindness," says the wretched Wave.
"It is nice that people come, are and are happy about Pärnu, which has wintered like a hibernation," he adds joyfully.
The throbbing wave from the beach doesn't bother you.
When he lived downtown, he still heard that music was played on the beach, now the music hasn't reached his home scene.
"But I hope I do," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also talked to the Õhtuleht, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu – it will make a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchants.
He also rejoices that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
You don't bother a party lady.
Although I'm not sunbathing on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach is alive.
And I'm glad people are moving and it's been like this three times already," says the woman.
I think it was a little worse the first time.
"Then perhaps there were complaints," he ponders.
However, according to him, the melu on the beach is common for the summer capitals.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, who is farting in the park.
Melu and the commotion have not shattered his rhythm of life.
But what for?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interethnic communication would be better.
A loud music doesn't crush a man.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can save and there's no trouble," he says.
According to him, guests who have come to Pärnu are polite.
"Of course, they have exaggerated a little with the bottles, but young people are young, and for God's sake, let's go, but be human and we can do it!" he says.
By then, the beachers have traveled away, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life – people like this kind of play," says Tiina, who has walked with children in Pärnu.
His family’s sleep doesn’t bother the music of the festival either, although last year it sounded even further than this year.
Last summer it was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live out of town, that it actually sounds pretty good down there by the Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to reinvigorate business.
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it will cut 3,000 more jobs and reduce its dividend by 72 percent, thus launching another restructuring programme to address the distress of the business.
The jobs that will be lost, according to CEO John Fallon, will most likely be made redundant at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by a further GBP 300 million ($394 million) under the third cost reduction programme in order to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that their expectations for the year have not changed since the announcement of a 1 % increase in sales revenue to GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in a suicide attack
According to the officials, the suicide bomber attacked military convoys in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and hurting several others.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the city’s Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have struck Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement said that a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "self-made explosive device carried by a human being".
According to the statement, everyone is in a stable state and is being treated at a US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the growing force of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) is a serious cause of concern for NATO forces in Bagram, Qarabagh.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shiid district in Kabul.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a large bomb attack killed more than 150 people in the city centre - the most deadly military attack in the country since the US-led troops took the Taliban out of power in 2001.
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's military and police forces.
Correspondents claim that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the smog order after actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama-era regulation, which obliges states to limit smog emissions, one day after 15 states took the Agency to court because of this move.
The EPA announced its decision to proceed with the "2015 ozone determination operations" late on Wednesday, saying that this would demonstrate the Agency's commitment to cooperation with States.
"We believe that we must engage in dialogue and listen to our state partners," said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in his statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced EPA’s intention to postpone the determinations of ozone in various parts of the country to measure smog pollution in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet a stricter air quality standard.
On Tuesday, 15 countries, mainly democratic states, brought an action together with the District of Columbia, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost economic growth.
But these efforts have caused a reaction among the democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of air containing ozone "may reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
German pigs could have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a feast because heavy rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, says Bloomberg.
This year, it may be that weeks of showers before harvesting can mean that bread grain is only suitable for feeding to animals.
"The quality of the wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015", said the analyst of Agravis Raiffeisen, Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can be turned into animal feed, double compared to normal, forecasted by Agrivis.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First of all, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a heat wave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainstorms, which have continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area hasn't even started harvesting yet, reported the local harvest collector Ceravis.
"It's a difficult day," said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, Ceravis' senior merchant.
Coherence in everything, or clever Finnish interior design wackos
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fair houses, because through the large windows, the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
At every step, our northern neighbours stand out in their efforts to create both crisp and perfect (energy-saving) homes.
It is worth admiring and also following that Finns use wood as building and finishing materials, in the manufacture of furniture and beauty articles.
Striking techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fair houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It illustrates that black, white, and grey shades, when supplemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, because the fair will last until August 13.
Accessories and herbal pots suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
This year's Weekend Festival Baltic was brought under the line on the night and Martin Garrix did everything he could on the main stage to remember the last performer.
The crowd was really turned around during the Garrix performance - singing, hollering, dancing self-esteem.
When Garrix finished, the combined mass was scattered from Pärnu beach to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures our photographer caught on Weekend in three days.
I'm sure you're one of them, too. Find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face the most attractive boxing match of up to 66.7 kg in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN's office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, walked across the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
After the victory of Garcia's unanimous decision over the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are in the top five of the scales.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
"I wish you luck."
Lomachenko protects his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7 pm at ESPN.
When the couple posed for the photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between fighters would be a "perfect measure".
"I'm former feathered-weight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up for Broner [63,5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move below the lightweight.
And he's going to have to move up to a light weight of 61.2 kg and then we can fight.
It's what the fans have wanted.
Let's offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be subject to a fee. It is part of his strategy to have Lomachenko debut 61.2 kg in class later this year in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has an interest in fighting Jorge Lineares and the winner of the Luke Campbell match after their Lightweight Round Forum on September 23.
"Looking at this fight could be subject to a fee, as fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, saying later that she is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We're the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said she thinks Lomachenko's a "mighty fighter" and might go see her Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that he thought the three division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this knockout".
Garcia said the goal was to show the strength of the blow and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension growing for prosperity between them.
"This is a fight that awaits realization.
No other confrontation will cause so much attention and buzz.
I am more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
It's gonna be a good fight."
Which corners of the world will they move to Estonia from?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
For example, when it was decided last year to grant a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, the number was 4928.
The authorities do not know how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared at the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia each year, but in recent years this figure is getting close to 2,000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1,087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens increases the most – 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than they left last year.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that opportunities for work and learning are being sought in a country where the community and many families are already ahead," stated Kristin Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the total number of fixed-term residence permits has been issued to the latter for ten years.
If Ukrainians come to work here mostly, then Russian citizens for family migration.
"Considering the historical Russian community here, they are more likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said the migration researcher of the Academy of Internal Defence, Helina Maasing.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received the Estonian residence permit have moved to live, then Harjumaa is immediately after Ida-Virumaa", he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased.
"Hype is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for for permanently moving to Estonia," explained Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has rather remained stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanent admission to Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage people who are adapted to stay here.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased due to the new residence permit.
For example, last year, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now the Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer follow with the finger whether the wage criterion is fulfilled.
This residence permit became popular – applicants last year were holders of a grey passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese, received a residence permit in order to settle in Estonia.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
In 2007, while three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, last year 200.
They come from Nigeria to study at the universities here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to learning mobility.
They also have the rule that where the community has emerged, there will be more people," Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit each year, it is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if we add the citizens of the European Union, migration will remain at about a percentage", Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to Statistics Estonia, 14 822 people travelled to Estonia last year, while 13 792 moved out.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of the movers and movers are Estonian citizens, but more of them are among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens last year was down to 2,000 people.
Estonians travel first and foremost between Finland and Estonia.
Mama Couture's princess fashion charms with sats, embroidery, and a fight.
The bottomless ark of ideas, however, is history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream somewhere in the museum for hours and admire old sleeves and collars.
When you do something with passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
Mammu Couture's glamorous world may seem like a stranger to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much radiance you have in your life!
I've got a girlfriend who's got a whole sauna full of Haute couture dresses I created.
Because it's not his fault he doesn't live in Hollywood and go on the red carpet every day, he wants to wear the most beautiful dresses, and he wears them!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everyday days.
It was this thought that made the plan to move high fashion into rural areas, between forests and fields in Estonia, to people to whom fashion often does not come.
Mamma's collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion alley, where with 45 models the royal de fillet filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, the pose is often taken in, nodded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - shouting bravo, standing up, wanting to thank you by your hand.
A lot of the audience just came to see you, but now they're Mamma Couture fans.
If you exceed people's expectations, they'll be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre-long red carpet full of beautiful dresses, and they didn't seem to come to an end!
Maria also does not admit the fashionable idea that creation must be presented to a super-sex supermodel, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
Often I invite my own clients on stage - they're always happy to come.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show myself, I'm always backstage to give things a last touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves won't allow me to watch the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who wants to be in everything by his hand, not just to play a representative role.
I've got my own sewing machine in the studio. I'll do most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
The design is not limited to stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything needs to fit into a temperamental woman's day.
I guess those hours are gonna be huge for fanatics.
I can't even tell when my day ends, it's just a day of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of luck: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and a compliment.
It's been said many times that there's magic in my dresses -- they make me feel like a princess.
The abundant tulle satsirades that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mamma Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp of U18 boys: the Estonian subgroup tournament gun has now been turned against us
I'm sorry, I ran out of fairy tales.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn't get our desk.
And if there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to do," commented Martin Müürsepp, Estonian U18 basketball boys, our only basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo's assistant coach, who played in NBA.
Opposers took 28 balls from the attack table and got so many more attacks.
We weren't prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build defense.
But in defense, they were able to hold hands everywhere. We couldn't combine.
It kicked the crew's legs.
Opposite homework was better done.
According to the mason, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take down the momentum of its opponents.
In the last quarter, we had a zero error, but the opponents have already been quickly rejected.
Athletics and the intense insistence that was our weapon on the sub-group tournament turned everything against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tass.
On the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, so far there was a uniform fist of percussion.
It's a pity you weren't met with such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has borne quite a burden.
But he made some pretty nice moves I've seen in practice before," added the tutor.
Horrible numbers: the ladies' basketball team scored less than 10 points on the EM tournament in three quarters...
In the U18 age class, it is not only young men's EM B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, and the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And unfortunately, the Estonian game with Poland was in the area of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but still after the third quarter the position was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes the opponents took their foot off the gas pedal and the period was tied 16:16.
In the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4 points, 3rd scored 1 point...
In the first two minutes, the Estonian women caught two of the first four shots, then 25 missed the game, then one in three and then 21 more shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour, one of 47 shots was caught.
In addition, there were 2 points for four free throws.
In that time, the number of ball losses was reasonable, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had 33th and Estonia had 13th percent (68-9).
Estonia has started with two defeats; on opening day, Portugal's 83:56 advantage had to be acknowledged.
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to replenish their supplies
Today NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Control Group arrived at Tallinn for a planned port visit to complete the supplies of ships and prepare for the forthcoming exercises.
In the course of the visit, the ships prepare for the sea’s Nasing and provide crew members with the opportunity to take a couple of days’ rest.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historic explosive devices.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation training in local waters is a good expression of our integration with allied forces", said Captain Major Arto Reinmaa, who is in charge of the operation and planning division of the Navy Fleet Commander.
Since 29 June NATO’s 1st Permanent Mine Control Group is led by Commander Gvido Laudups, a Latvian naval officer, who took over the task of group leader from the Estonian naval officer from Commander Johan-Elias Seljamaa at the ceremony in Riga.
The group's flagship is the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsait, which also has its command staff.
During this half-year, the international unit also includes the Estonian Navy Mine Hunter Sakala.
As one of the four groups of ships under the command of NATO's Marine Command, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Control Group is a rapid primary response unit that the Alliance can send to various parts of the world within five days.
Until August 4-13, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was established 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joost (36), the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic.
Risto Joost: The classics of the opera world include Traviata and Tosca, ballet performances from the enchanting Bolero to the fun Karlsson, and neither does the programme lack self-production, which is this time the production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorium "Yeartimes" by the same international creative team who brought Haydn's second masterpiece "Creation" to the stage on Pirita in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose fascination takes hold and will never let go again.
Because the experience that the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human perceptions in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of Birgitta Festival for your first year.
Didn't Maestro Erikas' shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it's been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my conducting career.
Maybe it'll make it easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much good into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it will be passed on to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work.
It was the great heart of Eri Klas that gave me strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could turn the audience on this year's festival that you're offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet written on Astrid Lindgren's story will be presented.
It's "Karlsson Flys."
And one of the chaotic nuances is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his wish to write the work.
Apparently, he's had a Karlsson character in his soul since he was a kid.
Risto, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have a lot of that.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions aren't as much dependent on other people as I am on myself, perhaps how I'm going to face every new day.
And this conscious tone, keeping positive and actually smiling at yourself in the mirror in the morning, greatly increased my lucky percentage.
Especially this week, when there are the most important tests, I have practiced it especially eagerly and it works.
Smiling on yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but everyone will discover it gradually.
Now, here's the big moment.
Do you have any ritual before you stepped into the conductor's remote?
Yes, it is. You'll have to change your clothes for more comfortable ones.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or take a nap before the big show.
In fact, I actually like to communicate actively with people, even before entering the conductor's remote.
But all of you come to Birgitta Festival, here's what you can discover for not a very big friend of the opera and ballet!
Watch the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results on age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
In Sweden, asylum seekers were subjected to a medical evaluation of their age with an innovative approach. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of those tested were rated older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were designed to further assess age in the asylum application after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly minors.
To date, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2,481 tests between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 years of age or older and in 25 other cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the testee "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18".
Tests are only used if the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute for Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see the big difference between the statistics of previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the Institute issued 581 test results and said that 442 cases "are indications that the person being studied is 18 years of age or older".
But when the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of those 581 tests, it turned out that 243 cases had been directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which uses X - ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints, has been criticised by dentists and radiologists in some districts.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose duties include evaluating people’s biological maturity to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later.
"I have had good reason to think about it, and I do not think that the method of measurement currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson, from the Institute of Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of the child being wrongly adult is small.
At the highest rate of about 10%, there is a risk if a person is just under 18."

The 20-year-old hammer-thrower, Anna Maria Orel, made a beautiful debut on the London M.M., getting a good 18th place on 67.37.
The organ was the youngest female castter in the M.M., and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80) I immediately finished my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) I managed to keep my head clear", Orel said after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
The debut of Anna Maria Orel's MM ended in a fine 18th place.
The rain didn't bother the organ because it's training winter through the TTU stadium.
"I'm tempered," he said with a little smile.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house full of people, did Orel sense people around him or was he able to turn himself off?
I did, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it'll add - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with the debut of M.M. and there are many more good competitions: "I came here this year with the 32nd or last result of season 32, I graduated in 18th place.
That's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and MMil - that's all that matters.
I'm taking along a good experience, and some days I want to compete for medals.
The Governor of West Virginia announced a party change.
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at a meeting on Thursday night with President Trump that he would change parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought over many times... today I say to you, to the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as democratic governor."
At the gathering, there was a joyful exhilaration.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a great announcement at the West Virginia gathering.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and he inherited the coal trade from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "the change of the Governor Justice's party is another blow to the democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from being made better again than working for it".
"All 15 governors and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of the party, which is from the top to the bottom, unable to find a positive and unifying message," said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there's a lot of people, there's a lot of injured people.
Urmet, who was in the medical tent at the Weekend, told the Evening Paper yesterday that they had to distribute a lot of patches.
Wools and bruises are basic, twisting and slight falls.
And, of course, head, back and leg pains.
Urmet said that visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes, and that's how problems come.
Medics have also had to assist visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, send the bigger ones to the hospital.
Check the video to see if the celebratory medics are asking for painkillers to treat hangovers.
Coe commended the Russians' honest apologies for the doping scandal.
According to Sebastian Coe, International Athletics, he commended "Russia's Thursday Fair Apologies" for the doping scandal, but he reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country to return to sport.
At the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship, Dmitry Shylakhtin, the leader of the Russian athletics, said that the ban imposed on his country is correct and that he has a clear aim to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletics who have stolen the gold and silver medals in the competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on competition imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to journalists.
"The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian alliance itself admitted that they had had quite a difficult time and that they would do everything possible to restructure the alliance."
Coe also said that he was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for reinstatement.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but the congress supports the group's proposal that now is not the right time for Russia's withdrawal," said Coe.
"We must do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always based on the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletics who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes in the world athletics championships starting on Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of criteria for reinstatement.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping controls were still inadequate and that banned coaches were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution substantially change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mine giants like Glencore can say they win from one place and lose from the other, smaller mining companies won't help.
Glencore currently earns from coal and oil, but demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will increase in the future era of electric cars.
This year, the decisions of the UK, France and Norway to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels have increased their contribution to the spread of electric cars.
That is why Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla is placing on the market a cheaper model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that electric cars will be sold more than oil-fired fuel for two decades already.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," said Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambranini to Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
There's about three times as much copper in electric cars as in ordinary cars, Glencore reported.
More copper is needed at charging stations, so Exane BNP Paribasi estimates that by 2025 it will increase copper demand by about five percent.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore derives a growing trend in electric cars from the rise in copper prices and the fact that it is the world's largest cobalt producer, forecasted by the Jefferies Group.
According to this brokerage company, the other winners from the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of the cobalt in the London Metal Exchange has gone up.
The price increase last year was 37 percent.
Copper has also risen by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose by 20 percent in London, overcoming the price rises of Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
Lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine are on the losing side, who have to adapt to the new era.
The main end use of lead is the power-supply batteries for petrol and diesel car starters.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the decline in demand", said Michael Widmer, the analysis manager of the metal market at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Lead in the form of price movement is not yet noticed in the unfolding trend.
Lead has risen by 17% this year, which is the best metal in the price increase for the main industrial metals in London.
Investors still see metal problems in the long run.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition," said the sales manager of the metal broker Triland Metals, Herwig Schmidt.
If the demand for lead falls, it will happen slowly.
Maybe this will happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, stricter exhaust emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on lead-based batteries developed during the frequent start-up of engines, will be assessed by an international research organisation for lead and zinc.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive away with less electricity.
This explains the additional demand of 1,6 million tonnes of aluminum up to 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the total world production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to deepen, said Widmer.
Aluminium has risen by 13% this year as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to market shortages.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to withstand aluminum.
"Exane BNP Paribasi's analyst Sylvain Brunet said, "High-strength steel should be the answer to this development."
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was used as catalysts for diesel-powered cars, reported metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many of the currently high demand raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have high demand in the future", said Bernard Dahdah, a raw materials analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum producers believe in the continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore's leader, Marc Grynberg, said that in 2025, more hybrid cars will continue to be sold than full electric cars.
The great hope of the platinum producers in the 10-year perspective is developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motosi on hydrogen cell-based cars that depend on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"Diisel seems to have a clear loser on his way to the electric cars," said Exane BNP of Paribas Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July as the Stuttgart court banned diesel use in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche’s home town.
How the financial rules of football affect the transition of Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar’s world record from switching from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain club in Barcelona, France.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game and which has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial rules for fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011 (FFP) mean that the PSG must at some point prove that the Neymar switchover was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar’s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s move to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to raise this kind of money to recruit Neymar and add it to its stellar lineup, given that the team will be financed by the family of the Katari Energy Fury.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of time recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into great debt in search of success are actually cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners were to give up support.
As of 2011, FFP has been focusing on monitoring their losses instead of debts of the clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then to make a big effort to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
In the present three-year assessment period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can absorb losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the disgraceful rejection of Platin from his presidency in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin of UEFA, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said The Associated Press Andrea Traverso last week, who is FFP’s supervisor at UEFA.
Although the PSG paid for the Neymar buy-in clause as a single full payment, they are able to split this amount into tranches for accounting purposes throughout the life of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, which makes it possible to demonstrate the transitional fee in the next five years as an amount of EUR 44,4 million per year.
On the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, received the most severe sanctions.
PSG was granted a fine of EUR 60 million (at that time of USD 82 million), which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to restrict the Masters League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to outsmart the regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through its owners-related companies.
While the company in Qatar may sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as a formal income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support was bloated.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service may come from Katar via payments from the 2022 World Championship Management Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador to the World Championships and claim that UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition of Neymar proactively with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is ensured as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG.
The most recent reports show that PSG made more than EUR 10 million in profits in the 2015-2016 season at around EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will have a positive impact on sponsorship, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase in turnover of at least 30 per cent due to the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar from switching, claiming that the PSG was therefore in breach of FFP.
"This is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, pointing out that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's attitude that the state finances the club.
"This is the result of ownership rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of a fair game, as the state may have other ways or other interests for such a large player to represent the country."

Along with the expansion of the geography of Norwegian action, the circle of people has also expanded in the plane chime.
Among the chosen individuals are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (on the photo) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, a plane will be decorated with the portrait of Queen’s legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
Today 50 years ago: a hurricane storm in Estonia that ripped roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which on August 6 and 7 caused serious damage to Läänemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular.
During these days, the wind speed in northwestern Estonia was more than 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
It was all dark and rabid, like the end of the world.
In 2002, the old lady Linda Kurova recalled Haapsalu in an interview with Eesti Loodus magazine.
Linda's husband saw the garden she planted collapse.
But what are you gonna do with your hands, where you're gonna get against a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, the water sprayed in the windows," said Mrs. Linda, who lived on the Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway platform had flown 20 to 30 metres away, Linda saw most of the Haapsaluns the next morning.
According to the locals, behind Paralepa the trees were lying on the ground, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm ran through beautiful old trees with cracks and cracks like a war.
Lääne-Virumaa was not badly damaged in the August storm in 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was also significant there, wrote the Virumaa Journal in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were wiped off the face of the earth, but the parks in our area were also badly damaged.
In Tallinn the wind speed was measured at up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the night of August 6th in Tallinn, a little girl had shouted, "Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down anymore!"," wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The building of Põlli Manor in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm in such a way that it was decided to demolish it later.
The constructions of Türi’s ski jump mountain did not survive the August storm, which was no longer restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star newspaper wrote that the cleaning of towns and settlements from fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and the residents could contribute to the cleaning.
The crop fields were also badly damaged in the storm, and the newspaper stated that "the first party organisations must be the initiators and directors of both organizational work and harvesting".
You can talk about hurricanes if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of wind winds in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu was measured at a wind speed of 48 m/s.
A measuring device broke on the Vaindloo island, so the strong wind speed measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning and poor coastal weather
Colder summer weather also means less tidy in Tallinn’s bathing areas.
"If there's weather, people are on the beach, and if there aren't, there's no people," says the beach cleaner.
Seagulls are screaming on the beach of Stroom in North Tallinn.
They are faced with a melodic competition from a tractor that bounces at low speeds and plows stripes on the beam.
In fact, the latter sifts seven centimetres [7 cm] of sand, picking out marine debris and people’s leftovers — bottle caps, cigarette butts, and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If the weather is beautiful, then the people are on the beach, and if it isn't, there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, director of the Haabersti Administration beach cleaning works.
It's 6:30 a.m., and there's a bitter cleaning on the beach, because at 8:00, the place has to be okay for people.
Usov's on duty by 4:00.
Besides Stroom, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Pikakar beach.
There's been a decrease in the amount of garbage.
Years ago, it was much more than that.
People can appreciate what they're doing for them now," says Usov, who's been cleaning beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
Now they're holding what's on the beach.
Price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on the beaches of Estonia is the cleaning of sea litter washed up on the shore.
For example, at Pirita Beach, it has to be transported 400,000 tons to the beach season.
"This is an incredible amount", notes Usov.
Another major category is household garbage, or all that people leave behind.
There are eight large waste containers on the shoreline of Stroom, which need to be emptied three times a week.
That's how much garbage you get.
However, colder summer weathers have meant that garbage is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third species is abandoned goods.
They're mostly children's toys.
This time, Usov has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They wait for the owners on the wooden road to the beach.
Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
Kids come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Trash torn apart
Erika Scholler, representative of Haaberst administrative services, admits that the tractor screening work is disrupted by locals.
The noise, which lasts from hours of the night to early morning, interferes with the sleep of people in the neighborhood.
By day, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
But the goal is, like Pirita, Pikkari and Pärnu, to get Stroom Beach under the international blue flag quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained", says Scholler.
We have more plows and rocks and harder to sift.
However, there is less garbage on our beaches than in other parts of Europe.
When Martin, who lives near Stroom Beach, talks about garbage on the beach, is unscrupulously engaged in the discussion of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a nasty picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with the birds and bottle pickers who have pulled the garbage bags inside out," says Martin.
While it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about trash cans and put covers on them, for example, in order to at least prevent birds from going on there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroom's beach.
It's obvious the city will take care of it.
Children’s fields, enlightened and newly asphalted roads have become more pleasant.
It used to be that on roller skates only one road could be driven", notes Martin.
Treasure Hunter Findings in Stroum: Coins, Only Coins
A 40 - year - old Dimitri, who combs the beachside with a metal detector as a treasure hunter, has come to take advantage of the morning tide period.
He doesn't think he'll find anything valuable today or in the future.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough.
"I've been doing this for a year and I haven't found anything valuable so far," says Dmitri.
As a hobby hunter, Dmitri’s treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps, and dangerous nails that later throws into the trash.
It's usually coins.
"There are usually no gold, rings and such," states the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak growth and inflation relief have softened speculation as a result of the rise.
Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish, as household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) policy makers voted to maintain rates of 6:2 at 0.25% and fewer members demand an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for this increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on household incomes would persist, as inflation is expected to rise to close to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signalled that the increase in rates will be necessary to contain the inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that a higher than expected increase in credit costs may be necessary in financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the Mammoth package, which was launched as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will end a fixed-term financing scheme offering cheap funding to the banks, although it said that it now expects a GBP 15 billion larger offer, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the mid-term forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will be powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of real incomes in households will continue to have an impact on consumption."
As regards rates, it was repeated that, in order to alleviate inflation, a "slight tightening of financial policy" was necessary, to the extent that the markets are expected to do so.
The stock exchange is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps would be gradual and limited.
The Bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for the increase of 1.8 % in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the exchange rate for the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators which have dampened the growing expectations of rising GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up a bit at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little cause to the households suffering from rising inflation and wretched wage increases, saying that the situation would get a little worse before it recovered.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income shocks in the next few years, but a marked recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision will come one year after the rates were moved to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for higher rates, as inflation had increased pressure on households in distress; in July, three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and there will be a rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco's mortgage brokers, said: "In view of the recent fall in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive once again, as lenders are looking for work and hope to complete the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those who are starting to complete their current transactions, as refinancing, often without a fee and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is writing 10,000 people out of conflict with HIV drug
From September onwards, patients will have access to "transformative" HIV preventive treatment after the battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that public health now makes available pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial, which have shown a reduction of around 86% in the risk of infection in people at high risk.
NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court’s ruling last year that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the institution’s own allegations that the medicine should be financed by local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, CEO of NHS England, welcomed this announcement on Thursday as a "new massive intervention", while the National Fund for AIDS (NAT) described it as "a turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, there will be more clinics before the program is implemented everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of infection with HIV.
Results from clinical trials indicate that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in your body that prevent you from getting HIV.
These medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
The candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and who are not treated.
The clinics identify suitable individuals who agree to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register at a local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program costs £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive the medicines this week after the international tender.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new massive intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in over three decades' struggle against one of mankind's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, acting director of NAT, said: 'This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted for those who need it and are at risk, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk for HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool, funded by this NHS clinical trial, which is individually manageable and independent of negotiating with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Terrence Higgins' fund CEO, Ian Green, said: "It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly started across the country and that no HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that the medicine for the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of getting HIV.
Public Health Shadow Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and dragging the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to HIV prevention and to stop the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is implemented as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, while Latvia and Lithuania fell.
In July, the difference in the price of the next day's electricity exchange between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference is the breakdowns in the Lithuanian-Swedish connections.
The average exchange price of electricity in Estonia last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour and the price increased 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price of Nord Pool was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven percent, respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved 75 per cent of the last month’s hours towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not carry out the following day's transactions.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99 per cent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 per cent of the hours had total transmission capacity in use.
According to transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the electricity exchange price may be around 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price of electricity increased last month and the transactions took place at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living a high life - semi-storey and smart design tips have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, traded his big Knightsbridge home in 2014 for an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," said Joanne.
"I've been looking for something that's equivalent to what I'm offering.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete upgrade.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout – to reach the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-storey to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Duck & Shed, an architectural and design studio in Erfan Azadi Notting Hill, to take advantage of the 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so there was an architectural challenge to create a semi-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"Metal construction is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would be placed on top of each other without having to bow down.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure to ensure that the height of both the upper and lower spaces was correct."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to create two rooms with dramatic elements at full height each other in the room.
From the half-floor, the ancient copper - lighted Retrouvius window opens a view of the glamorous living room below.
Golden furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and a retro-threaded Serge Mouille luminaire emphasizes the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and light saturation.
Mirrors are added at both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the rear wall with the mirror makes the window open in the other room look like a window.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage place for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
To the living room, the magic of the possibility to close the kitchen part is added by not using it, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
This kitchen, however, has a unique fact that it is a garage-type lifting door.
"There went a little bit of design effort," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when it's pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," Erfan says.
"The real estate broker walks into an out-of-date room and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are what you touch and thus help create an emotional bond with your home," says Erfan.
"You will not fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the tongues of the heart ring."
This shows that a good design and increased surface area help to make a rather ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they might make you want not to leave, like Joanne did.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago skyscraper-acting bounty hunter who competes with a colleague for promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money you earn, and all ethics is forgotten.
A man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself thinking that this is the version of "Card House" in the world of business - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's tone of speech is similar.
As the film goes on, the lower the frame house element, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers becomes increasingly apparent.
A life-changing experience becomes the protagonist’s son’s disease of cancer.
The choice now needs to be made between work and family life.
A son who dreams of being an architect makes his father think of really important things like faith, goodness, love, even the disaster of the twin towers, during his walks to the large buildings in Chicago.
After the third scene in which the son opens his father’s eyes, the filmmakers feel that they have come from the goal of getting the audience to cry, for even the most curly-hearted viewer can’t keep his tears from seeing the suffering of a beloved cancer - stricken boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, his father finally understands the morale of his work and does a good deed to an old man who is looking for a job.
Now, I bet on myself in the sense that if the movie has a happy self, I'll reward my insight after the film with coffee, but if I'm wrong, then the writer can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment there's a suspicion that I'm gonna lose my coffee... when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man runs down the hall in slow motion.
Rather, the son has been miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it will prove positive, since now there is time to deal with the family.
I get to feel good too - I can predict the end of American drama pretty well!
In truth, the film is well-designed, all the elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and morally beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will bring in a good one.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information that President Trumpin is reaching, including news, in the hope that it will keep the superior in a leveler water.
Here's a break from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met high-ranking officials on his first day of work, he pointed out the key problem of President Donald Trump's White House, which he planned to solve by reaching the President's hands with bad information.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through her, either on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he were given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried to, and they have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV watching habits have not gone away.
"If the candidate Trump was upset about the unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also fairly reflected in the affected publications," said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
At the time, Politico Tara Palmer wrote that "six former campaign workers said that the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a stable hymn of praise".
All right.
But the idea that Trump's tweeting habits have ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know Trump's tweeting would have been even more inflameable without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't post.
If his assistants could save him from trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House of competing clicks, people are exclusively trying to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the whole story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisors to feed the president strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is this:
"Current and former Trump employees say that Trump can react to a negative press, especially information leaks with damaging effects, exploding, obsessing about identifying their source.
This was also the case at the end of February, when someone gloatfully gave the president a printed copy of the article on the website GotNews.com, belonging to the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Katie Walsh, Deputy Chief of Staff, of being the White House's "source of multiple information leaks".
It doesn't matter that Johnson is permanently blocked from Twitter because of the mockery or that he didn't offer any specific evidence or that he's been making false accusations in the past and taking them back.
Trump read the article and started asking his employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Head of the White House Office Rob Porter "have attempted to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trumpin".
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do the exact same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll be a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who come from abroad to the capital do not get permission to perform.
Many foreigners perform music in the centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the Evening Paper spoke admitted that they were playing in the Old Town without the permission of the city council.
First we found three street musicians near the Viru gates who had brought as many dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with rastapats and shattered clothes were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite appearances, the only woman in the company played a fun tune on the accordion, while a man next to her juggling three balls and bringing the passersby closer.
The third man had sat next to them on one of the backpacks and smoked his own twisted joint in peace of heart.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, playing with Noem and the ball juggling Bob, said they were playing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the presentation was to collect the ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the same night.
On the question of whether they asked the city for permission to play in the old town, shaking Noem and Bob's heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and in most cases we will be given permits for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for that," Bob explained.
When we returned to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with musicians and were driving them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to try their luck at the intersection of Viru Centre.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one playing the violin, the other playing the clarinet, and the third was carrying an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and make money for fuel and living," explained Trio pianist Mivosh.
Mivoshi says they're aware that you have to have a government license to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but we'll have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased 149 million euros of bonds in July in the framework of the public sector asset purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area; the central bank’s bond portfolio increased to 4.36 billion euros in total.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases.
Governor of Eesti Pank Hardo Hansson has previously explained, in reply to an inquiry by the members of the Riigikogu, that the Eurosystem central banks' asset purchase programme includes three different purchasing programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who sell them to invest money elsewhere.
The acquisition results in lower return on lower-risk assets and incentivises investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, each central bank buys its own government bonds under a public bond purchase programme, while no other national bonds are purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limit of the amount allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase programme is restricted.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank usually buys bonds from European institutions, such as those from the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will buy bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s bonds were also purchased, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering’s bonds from June 2016.
From June onwards, both Elering and Eesti Energia will purchase bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Travelers ignore ditches and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the wealthiest owners of the West Midlands have once again fallen into a fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the council's dug ditch to win back the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field as a wealthy "millionaire district" near the baptized Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks after being kicked out of there in May, without being distracted by the ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the guards by squeezing their vehicles through the unblocked part of the road that had been left as a footpath.
The furious residents have been cursing the council of Solihull, saying that the council is "unnecessary to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after they were banished from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The Council must be shamed to take action because they are useless in tackling the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were chased away, and now they're back again.
There were more of them last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with these things by obtaining long restraints to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying the council tax if the council can't stop even such a thing."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said, "This is ridiculous. We have just seen the last of these travelers leave, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time the number has increased and even the horse has been seen on the grassland."
A representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite in the land near the Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with the Solihull police. We are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
It'll help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The Weekend festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that real world top names have been brought to Estonia.
The question of why Weekend festival is so important to Estonians is answered by the Saar that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the festival for three days.
However, he admits that real players have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this musical genre will be brought home - this often does not happen in our area," says the Minister of Culture.
But what artists at the festival speak most about the island itself?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and for old people like me, I'm sure one of the most experienced artists Armin van Buuren who stood up last night.
According to his tile twist, at some point all of us have been spinning our feet," he says.
But he does bring out many other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: starting with NO
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high," he says.
Take a closer look at the Evening Paper video!
Audi updates car manufacturers in the middle of criticism of up to 850 000 diesel vehicles
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said that it would provide software upgrades for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the BMW Chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the BMW home town of Munich, which have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been eager to advertise the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide released from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, who remained silent about the use of so-called "false devices", which allowed the exhaust emissions to be adjusted to comply with regulations during the testing of the car, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month the former head of the thermodynamics division of Audi Motor Development was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation in Germany concerning Volkswagen, when the authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent the European emissions requirements, thereby extending an investigation previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation can be a huge blow to Volkswagen's luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
For 20 000 euros, Estonian schools acquire the flags of the European Union.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
Altogether, 570 educational institutions of the European Union flags receive a total of 105x158 centimetres.
The flags are designed for indoor display, must also be carried out in high quality printing equipment indoors with tunnel fastening, mediate the news portal of the RR.
Flagvarda has a text on the label: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the 570 flags is 20 000 euros for the Ministry of Education, i.e. one flag costs 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which is sown by organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They're told it's important to change their routines.
The two senior journalists will discuss which seems safer: either bring the children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "Allies".
They're asking reporters to give names to every column, no need for proof, no need for impressions or intuitions.
There is a suspicion that drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are on the payroll of government or cartels that a whole list of bad guys who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
According to the Journalists’ Defence Committee, the majority of the bodies that accumulate across the country are reported to have been at least 25.589 journalists following attacks and threats, since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, and at least seven journalists in seven states have been killed during this year.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be felt everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of Valdez, pointing at the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" and two 30s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face or his characteristic Panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters will discuss joint trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor's Office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, which amount to thousands, journalists' killers rarely come to justice.
The Riodoce Editorial Office continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the killers' records and justice, the security meeting Ibarra said would be of little use.
"It's very silly to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"As long as the cause is not known, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla, forced to get out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates into the "twelveth River".
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, the subject of Valdez is mostly quiet.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of Sinaloa to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's most bloody battlefields because rival clicks are fighting to fill the power vacuum.
It does not matter that a person or even several people are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the graveyard is full of an abundance of decorated double - narco - king mausoleums larger than the homes of many living.
For a moment, let us forget that the peace period indicates that only one cartel is leading a maritime state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's co-founder and manager, Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels the enormous remorse that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with the leader of the cartel, Damascus Lopez, which competed with Guzman’s sons and was at war.
This piece may have angered the sons by suspected gang members buying all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid took place in another newspaper that covered the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always exist.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "was impossible to deal with the press without dealing with a drug problem."
In time, the newspaper gained fame with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising increased.
The reporters liked to publish powerful studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication from which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Committee for Journalists’ Freedom Award for his courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to go on living," he said when he accepted the AKK Prize.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the task of being a journalist. "An alternative is to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce Collective longs for Valdez, a joker who conjured like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and counsel, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went across the street from the office to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his love of routine was fatal to him.
His death has also made them doubt themselves about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you mess with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," said Bojorquez.
Even in the best of times, the result is strong self - censorship and self - maintenance.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to the editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that Sinaloa no longer has old rules, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero or other states, which are home to the toxic combination of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used in Mexico to track journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two police officers in the shade of a tree sought relief from the 40-degree heat.
The government assigned them to guard Riodoce's office in a four - story building in the middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered, half jokingly, whether these policemen were among the 50 percent policemen whom the governor himself had mistrusted.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to highland rural areas where de facto drug gangs are in control.
This week’s edition of Riodoce dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement of who was abducted or how it happened, so it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place for both drug dealers and public authorities.
The reporter learned from the public records that the restaurant was registered as a politician in the power of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of being widely involved in cases of corruption.
Villarrea asked a reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who wears the nickname El Chapo, escaped the military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column for information on kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known by now what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose clenic body has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels are cut off with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting against the murder of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected activists to do on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez.
The body was found burned, and according to the officials, it belongs to him on DNA tests.
Journalists have become louder throughout the country and scribble the phrase "SOS press" on pavements and buildings as an organized protest.
On that day, head Bojorquez will be away in Washington, trying to raise international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez died, when he met the Governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from reflecting the government’s activities, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "limited" by organised crime, co-sponsored public officials and indifferent society.
In his latest book Narco Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by orders from politicians and security forces who are in league with organized crime.
Last year, the Media Monitoring Group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and civil servants.
"In Mexico you will die because they want to silence you," said Ramirez.
The murders are obviously bleeding.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, probably signed by a cartel in Los Zetas, "I'm here for my report."
Next to his severed head, there was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in Chihuahua, a northern border state, after the death of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with the headline "What Do You Want From Us?" on the cover.
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a nervous decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they still have to watch the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they are chased, as is probably the case with the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexican apartment in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that reporting drugs scares her.
"Mexico is on his way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office on the sidewalk and drank beer when suddenly everyone’s phones began to vibrate.
In Mazatlan, a coastal resort town, 19 people were killed in gunfights between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the region.
From that very sidewalk, reporters put news on Riodoce’s website using their mobile phone.
The front cover of the next day needed to be changed.
The sirens chanted along another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez peeked at the police on guard to see if they were alert.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his middle finger can be seen throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff carried his footsteps.
"How could you even think about closing down?" said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him out to the streets to do a report?"
Dinosaurus used protective paint to prevent enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though quite frightening.
Scientists have now made public the first findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that its armored skin was reddish brown and its past had been somewhat "complex".
The report published in Current Biology described the creature as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a new nodosaurus species that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its unbelievably good preservation struck scientists who describe it as "really remarkable".
According to National Geographic magazine, this armored vegetarian is best preserved in the type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millenium at a mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He struck something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to examine it more closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Palaeontology Museum.
For the next six years, they worked to excavate an animal out of a 2,500-pound (1100-pound) plot.
After all the hard work, the end result is now ready to be brought to the public.
"If you squint a little, you can almost believe that he is asleep," said the lead author Caleb Brown, researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
By studying his skin, researchers found that this plant - eater, although covered with scales and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely exposed to considerable danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This heavy - armored dinosaur used red and white to protect itself from predators and applied a cloaking technique called countershadows, which is also used by many animals today.
According to experts, this allowed dinosaurs to better blend in and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs likely hunted him.
This 110 million-year-old Nodosaur family creature came to the news for the first time in May and is now being visited by the Royal Tyrrell Palaeontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory student at the Borealopelta Markmitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent over 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the team of international scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the body of the animal.
They discovered a countershadow - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower.
Although the countershadow has spread, the findings come as a surprise, since Borealopelta is much larger than the reshadow animals living today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred shadow rather than the confrontation of a survival tactic.
However, most animals using today's countershadows - e.g. deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to work really hard to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a dinosaur with huge and large scales shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous era could have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of Finns also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its intestines, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell in the river when it died, thus reaching the sea with a stream, where it sank to the bottom of the ocean in front of its back.
At that time Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to reach far further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin, while it has remained three dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - it's enough just to squint your eyes and it feels like she's asleep."
The Cretaceous Age was a time when huge two - footed carnivorous dinosaurs — terropods — roamed the Earth.
Although all their king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be hunted by some of his fearsome predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 m) long and six tons.
Scientists whose recent findings are published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined at Millenium Mine in Fort McMurray near North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and scales, and it is complete from cone to hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (5 m) long and weighed up to £3,000 (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch spikes broke out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored plant-eater wandered through the current West Canada until the flooded river washed it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial site helped to preserve its scales in excellent detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin continue to be covered by lumpy scales along the dinosaur skulls.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "This degree of survival is as rare as a lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the lumpy scales on the skull of the animal.
The right foot lies beside him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I'll be able to count the scales on his sole."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked.
Just the day after travelling to New York, this St. Louis resident, Airbnb, sat on a bed in a rented room, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He got into a post with a former schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Posts of @TheePharoah with a pint were repeatedly shared in his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area reported a real-time tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed, 18-year-old black man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street for four hours.
"This is crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He hung up on his phone, but he saw a tweet later this evening about a human gathering on Canfield Drive.
Photos of the police tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a sign saying, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He was watching a real-time stream where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In the second video, another cop cocked a gun and yelled, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
"This isn't the kind of murder we're used to and what we could call typical."
I felt the creeps at the time.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, he went to his father’s house to pick up his six - year - old daughter and decided that the next morning he and he would drive to Ferguson together.
What took place with Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary "Whose Streets?" (Whose Streets?") that will be premiered in cinemas on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the point of view of people who live in this community and who filled the streets with answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter - wearing a flowered dress and wearing a crown with it - drove towards Ferguson, they again talked about what they had discussed before this morning - the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't not take him with me," said Ferrell later.
"What's going on right now is... a culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know it and see it and grow in its midst.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions and what we need to do to get free and free.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he does not personally experience brazen racism, he is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on the road to South Florissant, a place across the police station, which had become a kind of campsite where activists were waiting for news about Officer Darren Wilson, who was eventually not charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with the local business owner, who made lunches.
They put together grocery bags and helped to distribute them to protestors.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, stating that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Minorities Association of Nurses and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It just worked out."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with a film co-director, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and the filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
Ferrelli wondered, "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such skepticism was due to countless cases where people - often Caucasians - come to the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already reached out to his co-director, Damon Davis, a district artist known for his activism in connection with sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the team after Brown was shot for years.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because so am I."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not "the leader of the ransomer, but the assembly of the community", as Folayan said - he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" records surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
'I felt like I was naked,' said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the work of linen ready.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story highlights and refocuss the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who came up with a theme reference #BlackLivesMatter after killing a black teenager named Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media are homosexual.
"Black homosexual women have maintained the movement in a leading role in general," said Ferrell, "and this is precisely because we must constantly fight on several fronts.
Black homosexual women must carry all this burden."
Folayan agreed, stating that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women".
At the same time, he claims that "it is not a type of equal opportunity creation" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the center of the film because of her identity.
"He was the person who exploded the right energy," he said.
"But it's no coincidence that he was right on the front line, because living as a black homosexual woman at such nodules is a lot at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras from Ferguson are long gone, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The probationary sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road lasts for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in an area he calls home, just a "dangerous threat".
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has etched into his memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
7 Tips to Cope With Hangover After Weekend’s Party
Some of the toughest male boys will find after a drinky party that helps.
Or they say "avoid hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a healthy fit.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painless as possible after today and tomorrow’s Weekend troll or other party?
Drink some water.
Drink down and onto, after a big party in the morning... or possibly even alcohol instead.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid while drinking alcohol, it needs to be recovered somehow.
With water, minerals are also washed out of the body and it is therefore good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or mildly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure a hangover shouldn't go to Grandma's house and break wood, which could be a fatal misdemeanor.
But a light walk helps the body remember what it's like to be alive again.
Lying in the tent and sleeping out the hangover is a more time - consuming way to heal.
Give the body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're starting to throw up enough of last night's overdrinking, I'm sure it's not worth trying to load a big fat steak in your stomach.
For example, start with fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars that slowly nourish your body.
If your health is already suffering around lunch, try broth, for example.
And a little later on, a knapsack.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from any water.
Like I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you are taking a painkiller to prevent hangover in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and thus lose performance.
That's how you ruin your liver even more, and from now on, hangovers are even worse.
Plus, the painkiller doesn't stay in the body much longer anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach, it'll upset your already broken stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, get along with yourself.
It's kind of like walking, but you don't get an orgasm when you walk.
Avoid being too active and frantic during the hangover, however, the physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Talk a fool to your friends and fellow sufferers, do simple silly things, and laugh friendlyly about yourself and others (suffering).
Jokes and laughs may not make a hangover go away, but I'm sure they're more fun to put up with after-effects.
One day, the hangover's gonna go away anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are wanted as suspects in murder.
According to the police, a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University are being hunted nationwide, becoming suspects after finding the body of a man with fatal stabbing wounds in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to the Cook County court records, arrest warrants were issued on Monday without bail for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranneau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27th.
The police received a phone call and found a victim in front of the Grand Plaza apartment building with multiple puncture wounds.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and investigators are treating stabbing as murder while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University for Public Relations, said in an e-mail application that Lathem is now temporarily suspended and is forbidden to enter the campuses of Northwestern University.
"It is now the criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and Northwestern University cooperates with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior assistant in Oxford University Finance.
In an e-mail application, a representative of the University and Somerville College said: "We have been in contact with the British police and are prepared to assist US research institutions in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the communication department at the Chicago Police Department, urges suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we are working more and more intensively to determine the exact location," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police had received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was a hideous sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He says security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on the chronology of events and identifying the victim's background and investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family dispute."
Start-up companies that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of her employees at her e-commerce start-up, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company in San Francisco that sells hair care products with 75 employees.
So he called on outsiders.
New types of start-ups are emerging to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with a specific objective of measuring employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line of complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to pass C-level managers and address the board directly.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytical tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Errett, he has had a much better view of what his employees think and feel in the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to surveys aimed at sudden surveys and specific teams, it offers a company heat map that provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies are beginning to understand that they need to stay informed about their working culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been wrapped up in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an oppressive environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020, according to the data on the Let's Talk Payments website for financial technology statistics.
Convertent, a start-up company in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed this year an increase in interest and activity against the background of Uber’s dubious reputation.
Convert has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to send custom impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line allowing employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, complaints go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been used by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, workers' departures and cases, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees in 500 sites, has used Convert for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find a telephone number or email address at the corporation’s headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday’s general adviser James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor employees’ complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convert, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which did not reach drivers who were operating in other offices in cities or states, can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to employees' holistic 360-degree experience," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media matured", did companies realise that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly washed online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convert offer their software as a service by charging companies a periodic fee for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Converti was financed in February by 10 million dollars by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thereby increasing the value of the capital raised to 47 million dollars.
Glint invested 10 million dollars in the Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing from the company's total funding to 60 million dollars.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, given the interconnectedness of businesses, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the stakes on the table.
Workers want to feel accepted and valued and devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is Vice-President of the Department of General Benefits and Employee Experience in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools allow the commitment and involvement of employees to be increased, it is no wonder that they will find support.
According to experts from the professional culture, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
However, this data is useless if the company’s supervisors do not do anything about it.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes will take place.
And if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, this could lead to disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask 4000 proposals, you must be ready for 4000 conversations," said President Russell Raath of the consulting and business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things don't end, the employees will think, "Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from disillusioned employees about the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, he was able to restructure several teams in the company and provide communication training to address the problems.
However, new data on workers are being collected in Ruby Tuesday and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high turnover in the workforce.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses."
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltics: incomes are growing fast
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic States, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes referring to the report by the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999 total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Progress is driven by low indebtedness, rapidly improving institutions and a business- and free-market-friendly policy.
"The Baltic countries, along with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita is significantly closer to the EU average," stated the central bank.
Although the aim is to ensure that the total output per capita of the economy is equal to that of the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total output per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries belonging to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local people are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the residents of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, less than half of those surveyed thought this about the economies of their countries.
NCAA’s decision to cancel twice a day exercises makes Bruins’ days long
It's almost 23 o'clock when a bunch of UCLA football players stop to chat at the edge of a new training ground on the team campus.
Some of them have stripped off their shirts, exposing their sweaty backs from the first day of the training camp.
For a large part of the team, these idle minutes offer a midday break.
After three hours of training, players participating in summer courses go back to the dormitory to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings the next morning at 6.30.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said Jim Mora, coach of Bruins, shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The decision of the NCAA to cancel training sessions that take place twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually lengthened their days - at least until the final exams are completed on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 19:15 to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two trainings per day means more days with one workout – the beginning of the Bruins training camp was moved forward for almost a week compared to the previous season and for the first time during the six seasons of Mora Westwood, training takes place during summer courses.
They have 18 training sessions scheduled until August 20th before the official preparation for the opening game in September against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of a change in the rules of the NCAA, although this adds another item to the players' tight schedules.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they will break through this trial; they will exert themselves; they are fine young.
I think when Saturday arrives and we have more time, it'll be really nice."
When the camp is over, UCLA’s trainings are closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of their squares from the nearby parking lot and the nearby Luskin Centre, a high - class hotel already hit by footballs that have escaped the protection net around the gatepost.
Since this weekend, Bruins' players are taking over the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems can arise with vacant rooms during the season.
"We're taking security measures," said Mora.
"This is a real problem and it is not too much to think that people can rent a room and film training there.
If you have a recording of your training, it could be a pretty good deal.
But we're gonna use a security team over there and in parking lot eight.
We'll do our best using what we've got.
I'm trying not to worry much about it.
We have a plan in place."
For revenge the Savisaar-Ivanova Electoral Union born to the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who had been forced to leave EKRE, were founded by uniting the forces of Our Tallinn and the businessmen's Electoral Union Tegus Tallinn – it seems that the electoral alliances created by the people who have been burned in party politics will participate in local elections at least as much as the political parties.
However, chicks will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
When the support of Edgar Savisaar has diminished, the events organised in honour of his election union can be expected.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current central parties and many unknown faces - is that what the composition of the electoral alliance will be?
And can the reason why some loyal followers and friends of Savisaar avoid running in Tallinn is that the list of the withdrawals, led by corrupts and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
The music video filmed on the roof of the city department for the Russian pop song, in which the mayor of Lasnamäe district participates; and in every sense a primitive computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid puddles and squirrels on his bike – is this how the Centre Party catches the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to go to the ballot boxes for the first time?
We look forward to seeing what other parties' perception of a youthful election campaign is.
If a Channel 2 or TV3 viewer has been watching a black square instead of an entertainment show since the beginning of August, there are two options: accept that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 channels will be available for free coverage from now on, or hand over ten channels to a television operator every month.
There are probably also those who, at first, publicly rejoice about the non-advert TV experience, but eventually, even though reluctantly, pay for television pictures and ads.
The deafening music, the noisy crowd and the garbage left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be a part of the jam yourself, it's worth going home to discover your country instead of hurting your head - and leaving the place to the festival guests for a good amount of money.
Washington is changing the rules of the green card.
The media are quoting President Donald Trump, who says that a new US immigration plan is planned that will change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
New rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The bill goes to Congress in two chambers.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money because it changes the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said the media outlets in the United States.
Siberian Seto youths move to the city, pensioners return to the country.
Jevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous Seto miners near the former Maana River.
He works as a driver in a gold hotel near the tributary of the Maana River Kuva, 140 kilometers from home.
This is hard work: for two months in a row without holidays, 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
During the three years worked in Artelli, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There is a hard order: when you go in, you check thoroughly so that you don't bring vodka, and when you go out, you don't bring gold," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho chatting with the local Seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture of Siberian Setos, which is still preserved, will also affect the Home Setos, because it is just so amazing, thinks Piho Mare, who studied the remote Setos in the most depth.
It's 30 years since his first study trip to Siberia this year.
During that time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many setus did they travel to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
It's an unsolved issue.
I say 8,000.
I calculated it from the story of the Siberian Seto men who have thought of it.
It's hard to say, because at the time, there could be up to 30 people in one group, but the passport was only given to a man.
The passport was given to one person only, but his children, sisters and other female relatives were with him.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was many times bigger than the historic Setomaa.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas that were not only connected with agriculture but also with the river (winter rafting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New St. Petersburg many Setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos then make up the majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived in a compact way.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and prolific childhood long persisted.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How different was Siberian Seto culture and different from Motherland Seto?
They're different, even though what was brought here was once there.
They brought a lot of folk costumes.
They made their own clothes, but they always knew the difference between what had been brought with them and what had been done here.
The traditional Seto clothing was strongly influenced by climate change, since it is colder here.
There's been a change of events.
For example, meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was just frozen here.

The connection with the motherland was spiritually strong; it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, begin to affect them.
Those girls who've been living in these families have been listening to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to visit Haida at the beginning of July to the Seto Kingdom Day and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's left of it, it's amazing.
"It is very easy to come and leave to kill, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of the highways," says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural sites, and pizza is available on every corner.
Kill is a top-up town!
There's a small island on the White River that runs through the city where the killers tend to have a Midsummer party.
"You can't see this beautiful place in the train window," mellows Reigo.
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water can swim in this river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I've done it!
You can have a picnic on the stream and just do romance - you can watch the river flow and think of life ahead and in the back.
I've been walking there with my girlfriends.
In addition to everything else, the Operisolist Tamm has been on the riverbank between the three bridges practicing his arias: "Because this place is by the town, no one may even return if I hum my own stories."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa from Männikumäe, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and now play discgolf, for example - the golf course is done, the disks can be rented from the fitness centre", is led by Reigo.
Old pros go there with their discs, of course, but I haven't been there yet to play.
I think it is necessary to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa, because he is an experienced discgolf player and has disks.
I think he'll lend it to me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood of the present opera soloist.
At least during ski classes.
There are many tears and disappointments left on this mountain and you can win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sledges and skis.
"All the downtown is now full of construction work, all of this is changing beyond recognition," Reigo commends.
Kill the old and weary stationery, however, is a very attractive place where summer discoveries are played.
I am glad that in 2012 the manager of R.A.A.A.M., Märt Meos, accepted my idea and came to the station with his theatre to do a summer theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with Aleksei Karenin has just ended, on August 11, the railway station will have "Life Awakening" when the old station is moving around in the 1980s.
"Until August 11-13, the days of Tapa City are during which home cafés have been opened and there are several cultural events, including the folk rally," said Reigo, who recommends a visit to a 91-year-old town in those days.
In a small yellow cabin on May 1, the museum has been in the boulevard since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and a lot of information", Reigo commends a place full of the history of Tapa, most of which focuses on railway and military activities.
Reigo smiles that if Tapa passes through all the recommended places, it will soon become hungry, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good places to eat, and sitting in cafes sometimes feels like you're abroad," he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, which is why sitting there makes you feel strange that you are in Estonia and your home town, but there is such an international group around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we've got a lot of moves!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of illegally camping people on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation now.
The State Department told the BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are caught resting in a place that is not intended to do so.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Puppy-taught wolves come to break sheep.
After a year's break, the farmers of Hiiumaa have to give their cattle "teaching material" to the wolves again - apparently the wolves who teach puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep in Hiiumaa County three times, 23 sheep in total, and eight have been injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the number was only three, a year earlier 124.
The data of the Environmental Agency is also in sync with the breaking data that last year no wolf litter was born in Hiiumaa and the information of the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that this year two wolf litters have been fixed on the island.
On the night of Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste parish and injured 18 surviving sheep half.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of Rheselja village and severely injured another who had to be killed.
Rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent the draft Act amending the Act on the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the coordination circle.
The amendment of the Act will abandon the creation of a separate database for both GM crops locations and operators, using the plant health register in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop operator to have a prior agreement with the beekeeping person within the prescribed limits is amended.
Although there are currently no genetically modified crops in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for co-existence between GM and non-GM crops.
At least until it is decided to declare Estonia GMO-free", said Sigmar Suu, Head of Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors", added Suu.
The draft Act repeals the provisions of the GM Crop Locations and Processors inventory and handling training in GMVS, establishes requirements for GM crop handling and business start-up.
In the specific case of beekeeping, the current obligation of the GM crop grower to inform the beekeepers of the start of the cultivation of the GM crop is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of the cultivation.
The draft Act has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult it in the Bills Information System and to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs if they wish.
The planned changes will affect in particular those active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in GM crop cultivation.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European corn plain, for which the MON 810 maize line is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this corn line have been developed in the southern regions, and this maize is not suitable for our climate.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in the seeds of different varieties of summer rape, maize and soya grown in Estonia to obtain certainty.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of oilseed rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above, it can be concluded that there is no deliberate cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited "genius" on Nemanja Matic's face after the central field player against Sampdoria debuted himself on Wednesday night.
A player bought over 40 million pounds from Chelsea started a victory against Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 at the beginning of the game in the last pre-season game in the United in Dublin, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were able to take their offensives freely.
But by staying out of Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was in dire need of a match form, and he lasted only 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, this must be repaired well before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mindset," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, started at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly began to set up his own man who started something by the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "great job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make it four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another stork boy got his foot on the GSM transmitter on August 1st and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird-watcher living in the Sõrve, the first stork was equipped with a transmitter in Sõrve, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nesting grounds and joined the Mullutu-Suurlahe large nightingale.
This is because there is no field in Sõrve, the voice of the Islands writes.
This Tuesday, relatively late to ring the cranes, another stork got attached to the transmitter on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter on Sõrves Türju.
"His activities are all watching on the Internet: how he went to Spain to winter, when he came back to the top of the German-Polish border and then came to Saaremaa," said Martinson.
The British inventor had a microchip implanted in his body to get into the house and the car with a handtag.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could simply open his front door, get into the office, and even start a car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and forefinger and now offers this service via his company BioTeq to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, consultant-anesthesiologist at Hampshire County Royal Hospital in Winchester Hants to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company will also change the locks on houses and cars to match the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married father of one child has installed technology now both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands.
According to the military documents released to Time magazine, the White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the southern courtyard cost taxpayers as much as $24,000 last month for the American production event.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the President's time on board, was the central attraction of the American building program in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials have been checking out industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to documents of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House military office required a section order for the presence of the helicopter, i.e. FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south yard for the "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, because this is an event of unusually high attention," said the HMX-1 commander the day before the event in an e-mail to his superior, the deputy officer in charge of the Navy in the field of aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive in the south yard at 7 p.m. on 17 July for the event starting at 3 p.m. and will remain there until the yard is cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same night.
The fact was added that if leaving the White House were to be delayed, the return flight would require a second epoch due to the limitations of working time.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squadron’s security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its time on the ground.
It was not possible to find out from the documents given to Time magazine whether or not a second crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event might violate this provision.
"We asked if it would violate Hatch's law, and we were told not to," wrote the commander.
"It seems you have no choice," answered the deputy officer in charge.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law would never have covered it.
But even at official events, there are political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of the health reform at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to control government regulations.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for a politically profitable purpose is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them for a pure photo shoot is unusual.
Trump got his attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, rolled into the background the president's plane, and his Twitter account was full of messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display "made in America" where products from all 50 states made by American workers from American materials were represented," said Lindsay Walters, acting spokesperson for the White House.
HMX-1 teams often test flights around Washington and in the south yard to practice putting down the U.S. President's White House with centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 organised 58 attempts in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to the event "made in America" was included in the flight standard for training flights of the flight crew of that month.
The squadron helicopters flew another 11 hours that day for non-presidential support missions.
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits of this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky’s representative, the company was not involved in organising exhibits in the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep budget documents for Presidential flights and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event.
But according to the Ministry of Defence's financial year 2017 hourly prices, the compensation rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron's records indicate the length of the flight from its main base at the naval Quantico airport in Virginia for 30 minutes in each direction.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below this sum.
"It is very misleading to calculate the costs of taxpayers on the basis of the estimated compensation rates," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irrevocably incurred expenses which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Sean Spicer, former spokesman of the White House, defended the use of the helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that the states of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are supposed to be hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it."
It is not clear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter during a tour of the south yard, but he did drive a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky’s representatives, making fun of the company’s products in his personal aircraft fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko — Peace and Joy Entered Through Tears
In 2011 MMil Deaegs hit Shadeiko in the last area, 800 m running foot ramp, and the girl was taken away from the stadium with a stretcher.
Shortly before that, he had been able to get a zero jump on the Chinese universality.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was injured by an injury in low cost, but he was ranked 23 by 6013 in the London debut Olympics.
However, the misfortune continued.
After the opening day of 2013 Moscow MM received Estonian record in the distance jump of the Estonian woman.
Two years later, he received 15th place on the Beijing M.M. and fulfilled the Olympic norm, but this had wanted more to disappoint the athlete.
Shadeiko passed through the hardest gauntlet only last year, when he did not get the result in the distance jump in Amsterdam EM.
I'd just like to put together one decent multitasking once.
Once," confessed Shadeiko.
The worst was still ahead: A month later, his Olympic contest in Rio was interrupted on the first barrier because of his thigh injury.
Time had to take off - do you want to continue with the seventh race?
Is two days of effort really worth all this?
She thought long, but she found peace.
I was able to clear my head.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that was just supposed to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and to clear my head.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pills in the bag yet," says Shadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean slate and move on with a fresh start.
Coach Anne Mägi said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the subject, but he realized that the athlete had to find out for himself first.
I mean, he was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wanted to prove to himself what he was worth," says Mägi.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He's doing it for himself.
The competition came back in May when Shadeiko set 6280 points for a new Estonian record at the Götzis multi-match.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top stamp with a bullet push of nearly three feet (13.89) and ran in a near-record time run.
At that time, the multiplayer sensed that it was not a ceiling of abilities, but that it was only the primary hunger of the race.
Mägi, who supervised him for years, says that Shadeiko is a model student.
He's a ready athlete. He's good to train.
If something's wrong or wrong, he's gonna say it now.
He knows his body and trusts his senses.
That's what we need to start with.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the type to make the maximum in practice," he says, and he says that the most important thing is to get the right knowledge, because it also ensures a good result.
The happiness of a close baby makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by the happiness of his loved ones.
His former training partner Maris Mägi and his sister Grete recently became parents, and they have received support from new citizens of the world.
"It's been interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol the drinking of which equals "training" in the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, this is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" wine taste process.
By sniffing the glass, spinning the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brain to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste is produced by the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the way the brain "sees" colors.
"Taste is not in wine, taste creates wine taster," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that wine is not to get drunk.
"There must be more in action," he says.
If you take a sip too big, the system will be saturated.
Too much wine drinking can harm the brain instead of benefit - according to the 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance, and reduced mental capacity risk.
10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay than their colleagues
Data from Fontes personnel search company reveal that 10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less wages than their colleagues.
The ten-percent pay gap is between men and women, writes the portal Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the salary survey of the ICT sector in Fontes.
In total, 8 577 posts were under consideration.
63% of jobs were employed by men.
"While only three companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and that there is no pay gap in the opinion of the rest of the companies, in reality the average monthly basic wage of men is 10% higher than that of women and the average annual wage of men is 8% higher than that of women," said Fontes analyst Ilmar Põhjala.
Narcos 3rd season commercial: now that Pablo Escobar is gone, Cali's cartel will take centre stage in the Netflix hit series
Despite the discovery of Pablo Escobar's killer in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first of them has already produced a commercial clip that teases the series of new bad guys.
In the third season, the DEA will focus its attention on the world's richest drug trading organization, the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, "like a Fortune 500 company", with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages links with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
The newly released advertising clip sees Pedro Pascal return to Javier Penana, a figure recruiting America and Colombia to help with the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" will be on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics.
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN relief mission, said that hundreds of women are running for the local Soviet elections, three women are running for Vice-President, and more than 30 percent of the recently registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban has threatened the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent electoral commission in Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more intense for both the big and the small.
There is always too little time in common, but practice with kids gives a good opportunity to combine co-existence, game, proximity and load.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you cruise in the summer, you'll always have a live one with you, and you'll be anxious to remember with your fine little voice: "Let's work out!"
Start with a warm-up - a normal game of heads or running along a beach strip is very good.
The crotch is the foundation of staying in the shape of feet and buttocks - who would want to take the form of a sandbread washed from the waves during the summer?
It is wonderful to use children instead of levers!
First, it is safe and comfortable, and the weight gradually grows at the same pace as the trainer's strength.
The advanced can also crouch with quite large children.
A child trains balance, reads repetitions, and enjoys the opportunity to hang high and be important.
Larger children can crouch at the same time.
Set the scope of motion by touching the earth and stretching your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-constituent to hold on properly.
A child can read repetitions and feel like a trainer.
The plank is a very useful exercise, but it's hopelessly boring for the child.
But it's easy to make it more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank column to slip through.
It's actually harder than usual, but it's much more fun to do than give a friend a hand in the meantime.
To add a load, you can stay in a plump, a little on your back, and walk around in this position.
An extra weight may be placed on the hips of a smaller child, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While crabs sift on the sand, the triceps, buttocks, and abs will get a load like a nibble.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight equally spreads to the front and back.
You can hold hands for safety.
Bend your legs and reach straight up.
Kid can fly, have fun, train balance and be a challenge.
Little coach's life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he wakes up.
The extra effort is to stretch your legs forward.
Make sure your back stays in neutral.
Children themselves have a much more fun way to make abs in pairs and claps.
Handicraft and pulsed squat.
Watch the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in neutral.
All the kids' favorite and big fun!
For the parent, at the same time, a truly effective whole body exercise.
The sports equipment was Ott (10), Spark (8), Luck (4).
From the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans
Boiled bags are summer classics, which have become a special hit product in recent years, and one of the right souvenirs has to hang on their hands, and merchants have been able to weld an appropriate price tag for a hit despite its modest origin.
A bag braided with straw is probably one of those things that has existed every single time of their lives and possession of which has not caused much emotion.
It's just there, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
Now, the shoulder bags are about to make a real victory, and fashion fans have switched their fancy designer bags for the summer months to simple straw bags.
It is not just a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and bolder women even walk into the office.
In this case, however, it is worth explaining first whether this summer look is still sitting for the boss or whether it is worth pushing the weasel and laptop into a more formal sumadan.
Varietal wealth, however, has made shoulder bags a real summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to be noticed is that fashion gourmets rush to the local market on a holiday trip and buy a bag of straw, which they will be faithful to for the rest of the vacation, along with the beach, the market, and with their friends hanging out on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags on the market and sell them or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that there is so much demand for bags among readers that women (and men!) in the real world would probably go hand-to-hand with each other to become the happy owner of some bags.
In a sense, this madness is also understandable, since it is rare for a fashion world to be able to buy a matter that has become a hit at just a few dozen euros.
It is true that clever merchants have also discovered the easy way to make money here, and so the finer luxury brands sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably just so richer customers don't have to feel like mere mortals promenade around with cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana a shoulder bag worth over a thousand euros.
However, the interpretation of Chanel’s shoulder bag can be interpreted at a rate of 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion hits, however, shoulder bags do not come from some big fashion makeup, but their story began far away.
It is claimed that straw bags come from a faraway Philippines from which they have been transported.
Boiling a bag of straw is especially an expori shop and the locals do not see it going around very often.
Allegedly, straw-repairing techniques date back to the 14th century and are quite saran with ordinary basket-pulling.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be woven as strongly as the basket, patterns and other materials can be embedded in it, making the bag more personal and thus more reactive.
For example, recently, there are particularly trendy bags that have been braided with coloured ribbons or leather strips.
The letter of thanks can primarily be sent by shoulder bags to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided shoulder bag fan ever seen before.
In fact, he fitted a shoulder bag with all kinds of outfit kits and didn't even think it would be much to go to Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of the bags today does not play a smaller role, but also the fact that caring for them is a cockhead, and unlike all other Sumadans, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and a wet towel.
As with trend rages, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations other than classic appearances.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a necklace or a tiny shoulder bag made of straw.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but on a straw rickety, it does.
But what's the classic shoulder bag like?
For centuries, a bag of straws has been regarded as classic, reminiscent of a basket in style, is open on top and has been short, as well as straws, handles.

A home with a golden touch in the milieu of Tammelinna
A woman builds a house instead of a funkhouse, a wooden house came up.
A missing man was found in Saaremaa three days ago.
The treasure left his home on Wednesday night in the village of Kärla in an unknown direction.

GMB is worried about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant.
The union expects confirmation of long-term production plans from the cookie manufacturer McVitie's managers at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of the Tollcross site investment.
More than 500 people work in a factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
The owner of McVitie's company, Pladis, said they've invested more than £5 million in the last few years.
They hired more employees and union leaders to be "the first to hear" if anything changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter addressed to the company’s object manager, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie’s request "to address concerns about the fact that the funding is not used to modernise production lines".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the main manager of the object on the business needs of Tollcross and the future investment plan is a cause for deep concern for our members.
There have been several generations of families working here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, as a necessary pillar to ensure decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, and in view of Brexit, the increase in living costs and the chronic decline in production, the company McVitie, which has a strong growth in productivity."
Pladis's representative said: "Tollcross's object manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with workers and union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between Tollcross employees and representatives of GMB, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross site, most of which has gone into production lines and improvements in operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and should there be any changes in the activity of the object, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up trying to lure Neymar into his ranks by making a bid of £ 189 million to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record conquest?
This sensational approach has opened the summer transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than twice the current world record of over-purchase, which was set up last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
Once the changeover has been completed, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and also the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, who will be paid over £500,000 a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is well-known to be angry both by its approach and by breaking Neymar's freedom, although a source close to Catalans' board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football player since its arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the football world of this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed an interest in entering into an agreement with Blaise Matud in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif severely warned all clubs who were thinking about recruiting some of the best players in the PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll face them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line because the Spanish club previously showed interest in Marco Verratt, the PSG’s central field player, this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be defeated as a result of this interest by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brex is seriously threatening to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland", Varadkar warned Northern Ireland on his first visit after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders", he stressed.
He said that he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because it is not able to do so, he would prefer to remain part of the European common market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to streamline Britain's departure would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: 'We could definitely have this with Britain'.
An alternative would be to return to customs posts that would declare historical division and political failure.
"The barrier to trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Belfast.
Märt Avant, who passed his first half-long triathlon: Ironman can pass by anyone.
The biggest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held today in the winter capital Otepää, when the semi-long Ironman competition fire was about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries.
The distance of 70,3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21,1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avant ended his first Triathlon triumphantly.
"I thought it would be complicated and eventually it was complicated," said Avant in the finish line.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that the triathlon was actually within reach of almost everyone.
"Not kill the distance, but kill the pace," he said, implying that at an affordable pace, almost everyone gets to the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: "It's all right with his physique, but unfortunately he can't swim."
Avandi had been working out eagerly since February.
First four or five hours a week, later ten hours a week.
At 05:34:12 he won 270th place in total.
Although Avandi lost to Raio Piiroja (Time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (Time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" contestants.
Last year Tanel Padar, who had been the "good example" person, lost to Avant in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
John Moldan, a German, was crowned the general winner of the calculation of the men of the Otepää stage in Ironman series at 3:58:27; the best of Estonians was Ivo Suur at 04:14:09.
Among the women, Dane Helle Frederiksen triumphed in 04:24:01; of the Estonians Maria Harese, who lost to Frederiksen in almost half an hour and became 04:58:58.
The avant passed a 1,9 km swim distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in position 410.
