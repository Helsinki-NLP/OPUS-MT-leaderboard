Two influential women share the secrets of their success
What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?
At first glance, these women come from two completely different worlds.
Barbara Corcoran, New York's real estate magnate, was able to convert a thousand dollar loan into a five billion-dollar real estate company before she applied her expertise on the TV screen, participating in ABC's Real Life Series "Shark Tank" Investor Panel.
Laila Ali has followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the four-time undefeated champion of the most successful female boxer before the roles of TV host, author and speaker were added to her resume.
Despite their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx still recruited both women to help them talk to a room full of hopeful entrepreneurs about breaking stereotypes and achieving ambitious goals.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in shops across the country and discovered that 80 percent of them feel that society has given them stereotypically sound roles and expectations.
As a result, they came up with a project called The Maxx You Project to help women break these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know a lot about it, and they may be at the top of their field by now, but the journey there wasn't smooth for either of them.
Corcoran was rated mainly by Ds in high school and college and had already worked in 20 jobs by the age of 23.
Ali entered one of the most man - centered areas, and on his way, he faced the challenge of trying to step out of his father’s shadow, who was an icon of the world.
These two, to put it mildly, overwhelm the knowledge they have acquired.
Therefore, we sat down with these influential women to talk about overcoming failures, coping with success, and trusting our gut in business and relationships.
What inspires you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I am inspired by my personal goals every day.
I have shaped a habit of writing down the things I want to achieve.
And I'm looking at that list.
I hold myself responsible.
Of course, my children inspire me.
My ambitions inspire me.
I wish to be victorious in everything I do in life.
I realize it takes a lot of work to achieve my goals, but I'm willing to do it.
My confidence comes from preparation.
So I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Lailala, the key to my confidence is too much preparation, but I do not draw my inspiration from it.
Actually, I'm inspired by genuine curiosity.
What happens if I do this?
What's not going to happen if I don't?
This curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning because I can't wait to see what the day brings with me.
If I don't feel that way some day, I'll just pretend to feel it.
Then I'll believe in myself and get inspired again.
Talk about some obstacles in your career that made you better in the long run.
Barbara Corcoran: The hardest thing for me was when my business partner's boyfriend left me and married my secretary.
I ended up in business a year later, but this year in my life - being the fifth wheel - it was terrible because I didn't have the confidence to leave.
I felt defeated. There was no inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
The hardest part is to believe in it when you're hit by setbacks.
It was a very difficult year to get back on your feet and start the business again from scratch - this time without a partner -.
Laila Ali: I would say that the hardest time in my career was when I was boxing, I was at the top of my career, and I decided to divorce.
I not only divorced my husband, but also the manager and the person who taught me everything I know about boxing.
I didn't think I could do it without him.
So I began to worry about the future of my career and had to find a time to take a step back and say to myself, "You have all the knowledge and experience you need.
You have all that experience in the ring.
You can definitely do it."
So I formed a new team around me and continued my career.
In fact, it was simply necessary to get the right state of mind, since all the rest of it got a boost.
I did what had to be done, faced with fear, and found the courage to get rid of my husband and manager, and to continue my career, and everything worked out.
When did you feel that you were really making progress?
Laila Ali: I felt that I had succeeded when I won my first championship title.
It felt really good, because when I started boxing, I wanted to be one of the best, to be invincible.
I was able to achieve this goal, and I won the championship title not once, but four times.
Barbara Corcoran: One moment when I felt that I had succeeded was in my eleventh year of activity.
I was finally making a profit.
I had made a profit of about $42,000 that I didn't expect.
I immediately went out and bought a new car for Mom and Dad, and they never had a new car, so I had the cars delivered to Florida, where they had their retirement.
I felt like the Queen of England.
I felt so cool.
I made much more money in the years to come, but nothing has yet been able to offer the same feeling as an opportunity to give back something to my parents and surprise them.
How could you keep yourself motivated to continue working during this 11-year period?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit because that was not my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could get.
I had a dream to be New York's real estate queen on my first day.
And I saw myself in my mind like a pope -- everybody kisses my ring and adores me.
I had this little thought in my head.
So when I kept trying every day, every hour, I didn't really think about making money.
Eventually, I made money by mistake.
But all the money that came in, I transferred right back into business.
I don't even think I had any daunting days where I thought, "Oh, my God, we don't make money.
I was just convinced something would work.
The worst thing that could have happened was losing the company and becoming a waitress again.
So I made a good tip, and I was happy.
I could be happy again.
That is why I do not believe that money is the great ambition of many people who have made progress.
They have other motives that spur them on.
And money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice for someone with such big dreams but who is held back by a financial factor?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn’t have time.
I started a company.
And that's why I found five different partners who weren't even specialists in the brokerage business, but in different neighborhoods all over town who knew their streets through and through.
I approached them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you the money and you'll be my partner."
The lesson here is that if you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have talent, you can sell it to someone with money and make money with it.
There are two aspects: talent and money.
But if it's not both together, nothing big will happen.
In the end, I - and my partners too - have done very well in all these years together with those great investors that I would never have had if I had not had the courage to find people who are fighting and who like to play.
You can always get money if you believe you have talent and know your part of the world better than anyone else.
What are the two or three things you do every morning to help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don’t know about you, but I have many moments in my life when I feel overwhelmed by being a mother, a businesswoman, a husband... all the roles we play as women.
I got to a point in my life where I really had to set up a morning routine.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Gratitude for the resurrection, for your health, for your children, for your family.
I often write down at night what my goals are for the next day, and when I wake up, I look at that list again.
Meditating.
Sometimes I write in a diary.
I always drink a cup of coffee.
And I always work out first thing in the morning, because if I don't, I'm not gonna do it.
For me, it is ultimately about priorities.
These are the things that are important to me: my spirituality, my focus on the universe and God, then training and putting my health first.
Thanks to this, everything else seems simple.
I feel that I can conquer all the challenges I face during the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I put things in order.
I'm working through my list of tasks, which is endless and ridiculous.
And I'm going to figure out what's most important.
What are the real priorities?
I'm trying to accept these most important things.
What are you doing to put yourself in the right state of mind for a big meeting?
Barbara Corcoran: I imagine myself failing.
It's as weird as it sounds.
I mean, God, I'm failing.
I'm scaring myself, and it makes me try harder.
I can imagine anyone who competes with me - I am very combative by nature because I am one of ten children and we never got enough of our parents' attention.
I can be very competitive.
And I always come here too thoroughly prepared.
Too much preparation strengthens my confidence.
Laila Ali: Amazing how opposed we are in this regard.
We are two successful people and this shows how different things work for different people.
I like to imagine I'm a success.
I like to think about the end, which is success.
I can see it in my mind, I can see it actually happening.
I see going into the ring, fighting, winning my belt and returning to the locker room, celebrating victory with a piece of cake, as I always did.
The same applies to meetings.
However, I always prepare myself thoroughly, and this confidence is the result of preparation, because there is a fear in the back of my head that I am not doing well, or that I am not saying the right things or that I do not have the necessary information.
This is where the preparation comes in for me.
But I always go in visualizing the end result.
You've both been very successful in your career.
How do you pass it on?
Laila Ali: I’m very excited to be part of the T.J. Maxx Project Maxx You Project because I feel it’s a chance to do good.
A great many women need inspiration, encouragement to pursue their dreams and goals.
There's a champion in all of us.
It's really about minding and having the tools you need, surrounding yourself with the right people, people who have managed to accomplish the things you're trying to achieve.
Barbara Corcoran: One thing I think I do very well is inspire people.
That's why I was very excited to be asked to cooperate with Maxx You Project.
I try to light the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see here on the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward.
Many people start to realize their dreams, but they tend to get off the road at some point.
So we try to help them focus on their goal.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even as simple as an elevator call, everything you need to set up a company.
What advice would you give to women who want to make progress in men-centred areas?
Laila Ali: I am active in one of the most men-centred areas of boxing.
To follow your father, who was a global icon and the best of all time, was quite daunting.
For me, the essence of the matter was actually to find the talent, the courage, the strength itself.
The first thing I had to do was believe in myself that I could walk into a ring and succeed.
At the time, no one else was involved but me, and there were no restrictions in my path except those that I had set myself in my head.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having an attitude like me - "The New York Real Estate Queen" - and crossing the finish line is enormously long.
And in this intermediate phase, every day in your career, you need a lot of talents.
You don't have to do real estate brokering to need their talents.
I am sure that in Laila's area, too, it was necessary to decide what are the right people, the right managers, when to start, when to finish, how much money you have, what you can put in, what you can't do, how hard you're willing to work.
These are all subjective decisions.
I'm trying to make these efforts a little more supportive, so these women really feel, "Okay, I get it.
Let me try.
Here are my three priorities."
When they leave with three main priorities to really make things happen, I go to bed with a smile at home tonight.
What's on your nightstand right now?
Laila Ali: Too much junk.
Magazines, books, little prayer angel, my diary.
Probably a water bottle.
Barbara Corcoran: My nightstand has a small green, windy alarm clock because I tried to break the habit of looking at the phone first thing every morning.
That's why I got it.
That was sweet.
But it never worked.
And he's still standing there.
And my phone is still on my nightstand.
What book are you reading now?
Barbara Corcoran: For the eighth or ninth time, "How to beat friends and influence people."
It keeps me on track.
I think it's still the best book written in this area, no matter what your dreams are, dreams can't be achieved without other people.
And it is possible to relate to it today in exactly the same way as in the past.
I like to count it from time to time.
It'll help me get back on track.
Laila Ali: I study in nutrition school, which is why I read the book Wheat-free Diet.
It's about eating cereals and how they affect our bodies.
I'm very interested.
What is your best advice on coping with successes and failures?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore the pessimists.
They come across all sorts of shapes.
You need to remove them from your brain vocabulary.
Stay away from the whiners.
They'll drain you of energy.
I think of the whiners as thieves.
They come at night, grab your wallet and leave.
The pessimists will destroy the team in any team situation faster than you can blink because people who feel sorry for themselves want others to feel bad.
They're pulling good people into the hole with them.
I'm perfectly capable of avoiding all negative people within a radius of 50 km of me because my goal is to be positive and take all the life I can get and give back everything I have to offer.
So why would I want to spend a minute on people like that?
Laila Ali: We must be consistent.
We start many times confident that we will now take this path.
Let's do it, this and this.
But people don't follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they reach the last hill.
So I think we need to stay on course.
If you're passionate about something, believe in something, you have to be consistent.
And you have to do the hard work that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: A lot of work has to be done to ensure consistency.
Do you know what it takes?
Finishing things.
You start something, you finish it.
Many are skilled starters, but not particularly skilled graduates.
In Latvia, the most non-citizens live in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja.
In Riga, 125 344, Daugavpils 14 266 and Liepāja 11 909.
Outside the major cities, the largest number of people living without Latvian citizenship are in Jekabpils (2347) and Valmiera (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, 242 560 people lived in Latvia without Latvian citizenship.
In 2007, Latvian stateless persons lived in Latvia 392 816.
Jürgen Ligi recently referred on Facebook to "Quote is a poor recital".
That is why I am not going to look back and try not to recall what has been done and what results have been achieved in history in order to rearrange human nature.
I am not evaluating whether these attempts can be considered successful or unsuccessful.
I also avoid too many sources, although in the back of my head I rely on the thought of my principal teacher, Toomas Paul: all my thoughts have been borrowed from somewhere, if only I could remember where exactly.
The most striking campaign in Estonia today is to rear the citizen of the Republic of Estonia - to be a perfect person.
We don't raise him like we raise a child - in good faith he'll be human.
We raise him as the ruling class imagines it: what kind of person should one be that he can live and speak publicly in Estonia.
Censorship is perfect.
Although the local ruling class partly changed a year ago, some husbandry methods are as frightening as those of the previous ruling class, now impoverished nobility - their brutality does not go any further.
They're just different.
Latvian beer is a brand drink for the fine tune of the new era.
Mandatory for Heads of State 0.5 promilles
The ruling class includes not only those politicians who are paid by the state for their work, but also those who are self-conscious who make politics voluntarily (read: intentionally): write opinion flags using Mihkel Mut's image, cursing on Facebook, how scary people around them live in Estonia that is deformed, pictifying, boycotting, juggling, sabotaging.
They are only willing to be in the echo chamber (the English expression for people living in a room where there are only suitable opinions for them, e.g. their own Facebook friends, etc.), but this is not possible in conflict Estonia.
Still, there's a fellow man who thinks or does something that's unbearable to the echoe.
And there's the war of speech, and the aggressors are thundering.
We have many politicians who know exactly how much to drink, how much to sleep with, how many children to breed, how to work, how much to get paid, when to rest, what to think about, how to eat, how to entertain, when to be sick, how to die.
Very important places.
If something else echoes these public speeches than what they said themselves, they are furious, offended, hysterical.
The fact that in many European countries people drive a "full head" car, and that is permitted by law, does not alter their opinion.
Zero tolerance is the only tolerance in every aspect, but behind zero tolerance, it is not care, but a ploward.
Class rage and racial desire - only people like me will do.
Saints can only open their mouths, but never their hearts.
They believe that any "action" they use to improve society works and deserves to be tried.
Fortunately for them, we have a guard of sufficient size with brilliant attention, clarets with spiritual disabilities, who jump through every window without feeling any pain.
That's why it seems to us that a clever peasant opens his mouth and is being emotionally beaten in a manor stable, that it is reasonable.
Some of the words that I'm sure will send us to the manor stables are, for example, gay, refugee, woman, violence, work, work.
If you believe everything that self-interested officials, activists and politicians say and write (that are only a small part of all groups, but they can scold so that society as a whole is deafening), the citizen is not only disgusting, vulgar and unpleasant, but also mindless, without a brain.
But let us not believe, do not make you tolerate, do not deny drinking.
In any case, Estonian people drink as much as they want, not as much as the state allows.
In any case, the Estonian person will tolerate more if he is not forced to tolerate.
Estonian people will not change their behaviour two months before the elections in order to turn their back on their popular diet after the goal has been achieved, and again, not only in the mouth, but also to expel what quickly restores unpleasant brain fat kilograms.
Whoever does this isn't the right Estonian.
I don't think it's possible to rearrange any people.
I think it's possible to teach a man.
To drink wisely, to love your family, to be a hardworking, polite, attractive companion, not just for friends, but for society as a whole.
You don't always have to fine, restrict, forbid, force, correct, corner, throw rotten eggs in a media bar.
The teacher must set an example.
A smoking politician talking about tobacco harm?
A speeding cop in his spare time gives me a speeding ticket?
And then he gets caught by a coworker with a bad head...
I have this tricky idea that maybe we should try to rearrange the ruling class.
Tell them not to drink in secret.
If you drink, drink in public: in Town Hall Square, under the eyes of all the people.
Force the speed to pass only in public - the rulers' cars, including private cars, be all red.
If you rule, rule as you rule yourself.
Maybe shame is enough if words and deeds don't add up.
Or we may find out that we want to be ruled by the most entrenched.
Because all of us Estonians are the kind of people we don't want to be at all.
Where to run from yourself?
According to former prosecutors, leaking Trump's transcripts is probably a federal crime.
Whoever leaked transcripts of phone calls between President Trump and foreign leaders to the press was likely to commit a crime, the former prosecutors claimed on Thursday when the legislators called for the defendant to be found.
"The unauthorized disclosure of these documents to the press is a crime," said former District Attorney of Columbia Joe diGenova Fox News.
These various acts, which include the disclosure of notes and transcripts of conversations between the President and foreign leaders, constitute a serious threat to national security.
On Thursday, based on the leaked documents, The Washington Post reported new details of Trump's intense speeches at the end of January with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
In the first, Trump allegedly ordered the Mexican Head of State to stop public witnessing that his government would not pay for the border wall.
According to the newspaper, transcripts contained notes indicating that they had been classified by the Supreme Commander of the National Security Council.
The Post said they received complete transcripts that had been compiled by "the White House employees" and were based on records from White House note makers.
"There is a federal law provision that makes such an unauthorized person of classified information leaking a crime, a federal crime," said Doug Burns, former New York Public Prosecutor at the telephone interview.
Although some details of these calls were already publicized in February, the publication of transcripts marks a much greater blow to the White House, which is trying to reduce leaks.
The report was published at random at a time when the leading figures of the Trump Administration were preparing to take a strong stand on Friday to demonstrate their commitment to the eradication of the leakers of classified information.
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions, National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, and Head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Centre William Evanina is expected to brief the public at the Ministry of Justice headquarters.
It is not clear whether the Ministry of Justice is investigating the leak in The Post.
For someone to be held responsible for this, Burns says that "certain elements must be clearly proved".
He said that there might be a fight on this subject, referring to a former Secretary of State's investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails and a decision not to press charges.
These considerations include the labelling and history of the document and its precise classification.
In the event of secrecy, the prosecutors shall examine whether the document was leaked to an unauthorised person in a way that adversely affects the interests of the United States of America.
"If all this can be proved, people can undoubtedly be in a criminally vulnerable situation," said Burns.
"No doubt."
When it comes to Trump's transcripts of phone calls, diGenova, who was a prosecutor of espionage cases, said that such documents were "usually classified as secret and above".
Claims that these leaks threaten the ability of the United States Government to pursue foreign policy, Mr DiGenova appealed to the Attorney General to convene a federal criminal jury to find the leakers.
He also said that a court order should be issued to obtain the records of the reporters and editors of The Washington Post - something that reporters would undoubtedly protest against.
Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee said on Thursday on Capitol Hill that there should be criminal proceedings for leaking classified information.
"We need to find the person who leaked them - he needs to be punished and fired in addition," said Lee Fox News on America's News HQ.
"This is unacceptable and such a thing should never happen."
Lee, who worked as a lawyer before he was elected to the Senate in 2010, said that such a leak was "a crime, a very serious federal crime".
"This action should and should not only be accompanied by dismissal, but also by criminal proceedings, given that classified information is involved," he said.
Fox News was told that, at this stage, the Ministry of Justice's announcement on Friday might rather give an overview of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve, not explain certain procedures.
Last week, President Sessions criticized and denounced the Attorney General, claiming that the latter had not made enough effort to find leakers.
"I want the Attorney General to be much tougher on the leaks from the security agencies," Trump said on July 25 at the rose garden.
Sessions themselves admitted last week to Fox News Tucker Carlson that he was not satisfied with the leaks that have repeatedly put obstacles to the President's investigation since his inauguration.
"I have not been satisfied with previous proceedings and investigations of criminal leaks," said Sessions.
Even some people who are critical of the President have spoken out against the leaks, saying that such a practice undermines foreign policy aspirations.
"The leaking of the transcript of a speech between the President and a foreign leader is outrageous, shocking and dangerous," wrote David Frum on Thursday at Atlanticus.
"It is extremely important for the President to be able to communicate confidentially - and perhaps even more importantly, so that foreign leaders understand that they can answer confidentially."
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), head of the Senate Security Committee, also told The Daily Beast that the leak was "absolutely" worrying and that the congress should investigate it.
10 vile advertising tricks to make food look more appealing
Since many foods are difficult to photograph, the picture uses a completely different ingredient that deceives people - for example, mashed potatoes instead of glue or ice cream instead of milk.
Youtube Channel Top Trending gives an overview of what tricks are quite common in the advertising world.
When someone opens a bag of popcorn in a commercial or takes a hamburger out of a box, a lot of nice steam comes out of it.
In practice, the shot is longer and the hot food will not evaporate throughout this time, because steam comes from a high water content, which is not available for example on pastries.
Soaked cotton balls, which have the ability to absorb and store a lot of water, are therefore incorporated in the packaging or food.
In the immediate vicinity of the heat, they steam much longer than a burger or popcorn, and the product gets a freshly prepared look.
Potato mash is a great helper to photographers because it does not melt in light or heat and does not significantly change consistency like many other foods.
For example, instead of filling the cake with cream or ice cream that looks like ice cream, it may be mashed potatoes.
Some color and decorative elements, and the consumer has been deceived again.
The glue replaces milk.
Milk is also not easy to photograph, as it may not look so white in the photograph.
Also, food served with milk quickly becomes slopy inside it.
Because, for example, breakfast flakes or muesli must look crispy and delicious inside milk, instead of milk, glue is used that does not pass through any flakes.
If restaurants can work hard to make meat so that the result is juicy and ripe, they do not do so in advertising.
Yet, the meat presented in the advertisement looks particularly appealing, as if coming directly from the grill.
Often, however, it is cooked on a frying pan or cooked in an oven and the grilling stripes are pulled onto the meat with shoe wax.
It's just as hard to work with whipped cream as ice cream because it tends to melt.
Fortunately, there is a product that is almost identical in appearance to whipped cream - shaving foam.
So it could be on top of a cake or berries or in a milkshake.
Even fruit sold in shops may have a thin layer of wax on the surface, making them look more shiny.
However, it is not enough for the photograph, and deodorant is sprayed instead to add gloss to the fruit.
The sauces are also not very photogenic, as they become more liquid or, for example, release water.
In this case, however, wax comes to the aid of which vivid colors and a more permanent texture make it possible to make an appealing sight of appetite.
Wax is also likely used in pictures where melting chocolate flows on the cake or ice cream.
If you notice a cake with an ideal cross - cutting, where the biscuit to filling ratio is ideal, it is likely that some extra layers or pieces of cardboard have been used.
This is because by cutting the cake, the filling can disperse and ruin the picture.
After cutting, if the cake is pushed into pieces of cardboard and sprayed over with a filling, it gives a visually more beautiful impression.
The cardboard and the pins are also used inside the burger to set all the ingredients there to stay perfectly still.
That's why a burger doesn't look like in a commercial.
A chicken stuffed with paper.
The ad looks juicy and full, but it may not even be cooked.
To make a full impression, the chicken is stuffed with paper, sanded with the mashed potatoes before, if necessary, and then sprayed with brown paint.
Pancakes are particularly poured with maple syrup in American ads, because this picture gives people a big appetite for pancakes.
In fact, cakes absorb syrup quickly, and the flowing stream of syrup quickly disappears from the face of the photographer.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed with a cleaning agent for the sofa lid, which helps to prevent rapid absorption.
This often does not help, so gold - brown engine oil, which is poured on warm pancakes and presented as syrup, is used instead.
A former soldier was sentenced to prison for the murder of a pensioner suspected of sexual abuse.
A former soldier was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man he suspected of mistreatment of a woman he knew.
Richard Cassidy (70) was convicted in June of the murder of David Farish (75) at his home in Tweedbank in Roxburghshire in February 2016.
Judge Lord Summers called murder "extremely brutal" because there were 14 puncture wounds in the victim's body.
Defense attorney Brian McConnachie said that the killing was caused by "minor madness," but he described the circumstances as "extraordinary."
Cassidy heard that Farish had sexually abused a woman for a long time.
His lawyer said that the man went to Farish's house and "friended" with him in the hope of hearing a confession, not a plan to kill him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy demonstrated signs of intent on the day of the attack and referred to a social work report showing that the accused had received training in the military in how to infiltrate groups by means of friendship.
Farish had not been charged.
The court reported that Cassidy contacted the police herself after the murder and turned herself in.
McConnachie said most people have "hard to understand" that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The defense attorney said, "He's never had a problem before this incident.
He lived a full life until this moment of madness in February 2016."
Cassidy’s health is reportedly poor and has suffered a heart attack and stroke while under arrest.
Lord Summers said he took into account the fact that Cassidy had no previous convictions and what he was supposed to have been told about Farish with a minimum term of imprisonment of 17 years.
The Scottish police described the case as "the particularly appalling murder of a fragile older man in his own home".
Detective David Pinkney said, "Although this punishment does not undo his cruel act, I still hope that it will provide David's family with some sort of solution."
Monday was the last chance to propose a nice name for a rhinoceros foal born early in June.
The zookeepers now have a large box of names to examine to find the right one to declare on the zoo’s birthday on August 25th.
However, the name can still be offered to the young minks until the day of regaining their independence.
From the beginning of August, the entire rhino family can be seen walking in the courtyards together.
And even though Father Kigoma occasionally runs around in the gusts of his hair, his mother does not let Kibibi disturb her, but his rhino foal learns valuable lessons.
Although the peak of births is over, on August 1st you saw the weather light of the Jacuzzi and two domestic goats for him.
On the warm summer day of Kullimäe, the bathing eagles may be caught.
The takins, the quaint-looking goats, started running time.
On Thursday, another colour day of Vivacolor took place in the zoo.
A large number of good helpers painted the new camel house, the garden poles of the large yard garden garden of the female elephants, and the view terrace of the male elephant.
Fien and Draay once again spent time with Carl, a male elephant.
On August 9th, on the second day of the classics of the zoo, Aavo Otsa will perform a trumpet band.
In memory of the zoo, you can buy mugs with rhinos and minks and other fine souvenirs.
The proceeds from the sale of charities will be used to support the relevant species conservation project.
On tiger day last week, more than 1000 euros were collected at charity sales.
It is worth knowing: how to calculate how much sugar is in the milk product?
"According to European Union food labelling standards, the quantity of carbohydrates and sugars can be displayed on the packaging, which is not equal at all to the quantity of white, so-called table sugar," said Krista Kalbin, marketing director of Valio Estonia.
According to him, there are three types of sugar in dairy products: lactose in milk, or natural milk sugar, glucose and fructose in fruit, and added sugar or sucrose.
However, bearing in mind a few simple basic truths, Kalbin said that the calculation of the amount of added sugars contained in the product should not be difficult.
It must first be clarified whether it is a milk product or a fermented milk product.
Normal milk and milk drinks contain about 5 grams of natural milk sugar, or lactose per 100 grams of product.
In acidified milk products, yoghurt or kefir bacteria have consumed some of the lactose during the acidification process, resulting in an average of 3,5g/100g of lactose per product in acidified milk products.
'The first thing to calculate the amount of added sugar is to calculate lactose from the quantity of sugars', said Kalbin.
The amount of sugars now needs to be calculated from fructose and glucose from berries and fruits.
"In general, fructose and glucose in flavoured milk products have a normal 3-4% fruit content of approximately 0.3 grams and especially in eggs of approximately 15% fruit products up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams", Kalbin said.
According to him, this simple calculation shows that the percentage of added sugar in berry yoghurts can be up to twice as low as the percentage of sugars on the packaging.
In the case of lactose-free products, the situation is slightly different as sugar content depends on production technology.
Comparison of the most favourable spa packages: from nightclub tickets to sauna rituals
The mailman's consumer service compared the more favourable packages offered by spas for one person for one night on 11-12 August.
"Spa hotels have different levels and service choices, so it is very difficult to make one comparison for one to one based on price only", said Mario Sau, sales manager of OÜ Spa Tours.
Compared to the spa accommodation facilities, it turns out that the prices of the most affordable packages vary several times and there are options available for both the more demanding customer and the more modest holiday-makers.
For example, if a passenger can spend 51 euros alone in a single room of Värska Spa in the water centre house with buffet evenings and breakfast and unlimited use of water park, gym and saunas, the price of the package is 287 euros for one person when visiting Pädaste Manor with a companion in Muhumaa.
It includes accommodation in the Double Deluxe category room, breakfast in the Alexander Winter Garden restaurant, and a half-day spa package for "Choice and Moisture".
When choosing and comparing different packages, it should be taken into account that you should take a holiday with a friend or companion in order to get the most affordable price, because staying in a double room is more affordable than taking a single room.
However, if there is a desire to rest alone, the guest will be offered both special one-person rooms and double rooms for an additional fee.
While, in general, a passenger who does not have a date has to pay an extra of 20 euros for being alone in a double room, it is also possible to find more favourable options when making compromises.
For example, in Fra Mare Thalasso Spa in Haapsalu, the package costs 86 euros to stay in a single room, but if you wish, it also offers a more favourable option to stay in a double room, provided that in case of lack of space someone else is accommodated by informing the customer in advance.
In this case, the price of the package will be EUR 58.
It is worth being flexible to get the most favourable deal.
Package prices are dynamic, i.e. they depend on the day of the week and the filling.
"In the case of the most favourable package, prices may vary from 112 to 248 euros", explained the sales and marketing manager of V Spa Hotel in Tartu, Triinu Teras, who explained their pricing policy.
He also pointed out that the price in their hotels is variable, depending on the performance, and added that the customer generally receives the most favourable price by booking directly from their website or by asking for an offer.
Since the summer period is the fastest for spas, it is best to plan the holiday in good time to avoid the situation where the desired place has been sold out.
For example, only suites have been selected in Pärnu Hedon Spa as well as Strand Spa and the conference hotel, and Vihula Manor in Lahemaa has been sold out.
It is not necessary to look far for opportunities for relaxing holidays: almost every major Estonian city finds one or even several spas.
At the same time, it is worth looking into whether or not there will be any major events in the vicinity before buying the package, as it will immediately raise prices to the ceiling.
For example, from August 11-13, the White Lady's events will take place in Haapsalu.
At that time, there are many tourists in Haapsalu, demand for accommodations is very high, and we have big events at that time.
"Therefore, we do not have accommodation for sale at a reduced price or affordable packages at that time", commented Irene Väli, the manager of the spa hotel Laine.
The Chinese company that came to Estonia last year immediately made 100 million euros of turnover
The Chinese owned agricultural production seller Agritera, which only started its operations last year, reached nearly EUR 100 million in turnover.
The profit was almost 2 million euros, says Business Day.
The company’s annual report shows that Agritera OÜ’s sales revenue for the buying-in of agricultural products and wholesale trade amounted to EUR 100.6 million in 2016.
Profits amounted to EUR 1.91 million.
There was no economic activity in the company a year earlier.
The company employed an average of 3 people last year, with no employees in 2015.
Turnover per employee amounted to EUR 33.6 million, with an average gross remuneration of EUR 316 per month.
Jüri Kolk: Rest all year so you don't have to rest.
Of course, it was my fault I missed that vacation.
I guess I was also a somewhat necessary employee, but I guess I was the only one who thought he was indispensable.
It's my own fault that I felt a stupid sense of duty in my chest.
The quote given at the beginning of this column is nice because it is entirely true.
So it was - the new job that I started in March of the same year required a bit of work, but something in this job was so much better for me to recover from a whole new life in three months, to rest myself.
It's summer, vacation time.
It's time to make New Year's promises, see what's happened in life and what's going on with this whole thing.
"It's Christmas and New Year's Eve for that!" shouts some decent citizen now.
Maybe it is, but we all know from our experience that Christmas is not suitable for thinking about life and setting goals.
All right, I'll only speak for myself. I can't make any changes on New Year's Eve.
This is too hard for me.
Of course, there is happiness and joy in the Christmas season: I like to know the beginning of the light's triumph, to enjoy the Christmas lights, and Jesus was also a well-liked, revolutionaryly minded fellow.
Nevertheless, at Christmas I am mostly very tired and sometimes stressed - even because of this darkness.
Yeah, I'm doing a lot of work living a vacation-free life, maybe more than I'd do in some fucking slaughterhouse, and I've been pretty rested all the time.
Most of the time before Christmas I've been running like a squirrel on a bike - gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a little more load at work ...
Even taking into account the constant social pressure to feel unconditional joy and peace in the heart, the difficulties of Christmastime are obvious.
But a desperate and tired person can't make good decisions, much less perfect them for a plan.
Such things must be done with a more or less clear head.
A tired person may throw an empty and resounding promise into the air, which helps to build the foundation of the future about as much as buying a lottery ticket.
A promise that is meant to change something should be thought through calmly; it should benefit, it should be a plan.
The plan, so unlike the promise, contains not only a goal, but also a code of conduct, and it doesn't break because of a few small setbacks.
That's why I'm saying the best time to figure out promises is now, summer.
You just have to relax and wonder why it's as much tiredness as it is.
If you are not obliged to struggle like a calf that has escaped from the barn during your vacation, then a few weeks will be enough to find a hook in your life that deserves to be straightened out and to figure out exactly how it will be done.
I consider it important to live as much as possible so that there is no need for me to rest on a regular basis, not once a year.
So a holiday would be an extra pleasure, not a pit stop for survival, during which you'll be loaded so much that you'll be able to hold on to the next year.
I recommend at least one simple summer promise to everyone - if you have to get up at a certain time the next morning, get to bed early tonight.
I believe that if one in ten postimees readers listened to my recommendation, life in Estonia would be considerably better.
I'm going to follow my advice.
We already have a four-day working week, but it's not what we're expecting.

Many Estonians already have a four - day week of work unknowingly desired by them.
But not as they would expect, says Business Day.
It has been created by modern workspace planning, or open office.
According to Harvard Business Review, a prestigious management magazine, employees spend nearly 1.5 hours a day, or almost a full day of work a week empty.
However, if a four-day working week means four working days and three rest days, then such a forced solution is worse than that.
The 1.5 hours taken from working hours have been furnished with concentration difficulties, interference with work, increased irritation and anxiety, and the loss of work equipment instead of family and hobby or holiday recovery.
Weekend's third festival day is accompanied by a strong wind.
Thus, a distressed seagull caught the camera eye of the photograph of the evening leaf, trying to fly in defiance of the wind.
Because of windy weather, many visitors to the festival admit that their mouth and eyes are full of sand.
How a man built a theme park that cost his daughter $51 million
A father in Texas discovered that there was no theme park where his disabled daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman had just come out of the pool on a family vacation when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan approached other children playing in the water.
He tried to make friends with them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they got scared because they don't know how to treat a disabled person - Morgan has a five-year cognitive understanding and also a certain form of autism.
This incident was haunted by him.
"Morgan is a lovely young girl.
Meeting him always brings a smile to his mouth, and he certainly wants to hug.
But there have been many times where we have not been able to take him to different places," he says.
Hartman and his wife, Maggie, asked other parents where they could take their daughter, somewhere where she would feel comfortable and others would feel good about her as well.
"We came to the conclusion that there is no such inclusive place," says Hartman.
It therefore decided to build it itself in 2007.
A former real estate developer sold his home construction companies in 2005 to establish The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps people with disabilities.
He then started creating the world's first highly accessible theme park.
"We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do anything where people with and without special needs can play," says Hartman.
He called together doctors, therapists, parents, and other disabled and disabled people to consult on the facility.
They were set up in a 10-hectare abandoned career in San Antonio, Texas.
The park called Morgan's Wonderland paid $34 million (GBP 26 million) and was opened in 2010.
The attractions include a fully accessible Ferris wheel, an adventure playground and a mini-train.
Visitors often tell Hartman that they were only able to experience such attractions for the first time.
There is also a carousel with carriages specially designed for wheelchairs that move up and down alongside animals.
Hartman admits, however, that Morgan was initially afraid of driving.
"When we opened it, he didn't dare go into it.
He did not understand why it was going around and why animals were moving up and down," says Hartman.
It took three years before Morgan agreed to go to the carousel.
"At first he just stood near it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the race.
It was a slow process, but now he loves to drive it.
Getting over something that scared him meant a lot to him.
The little things you've achieved make a big difference."
Since its opening, Morgan's Wonderland has been visited by over a million people from 67 countries and all 50 states of America.
One third of the staff is disabled and entry is free of charge for anyone who has a medical condition.
"I realized Morgan was one of the lucky ones because she had many things she needed.
I didn't want the price to be an obstacle to other people with special needs," says Hartman.
"We open every year, knowing that we will lose at least a million dollars (£750.000) and we will have to earn it back with the help of fundraisers and partners."
This year the theme park Morgan's Inspiration Island, or fully accessible water park, was expanded.
"In July, fewer people visited the park because the wheelchairs got too hot.
So we decided to set up a water park next door," Hartman says.
Some parts of the island use hot water to help visitors with muscle problems.
Waterproof motorised wheelchairs operating with compressed air, not batteries, are available.
It is also possible to take a boat on the river.
The water park cost a total of 17 million dollars (13 million pounds).
"A man came to me yesterday in Inspiration Island and just held my hand," says Hartman.
"He pointed to his son, who had serious special needs, and began to cry.
He said his son had never been able to play in the water before."
According to Hartman, three of the four visitors to the park are not disabled, and the park has exactly the effect it hoped for.
"It helps people to understand that although we are different in certain ways, we are actually exactly the same," he says.
"I saw one girl in a wheelchair go to another girl with no special needs and they started playing together.
That was really cool."
Hartman has no intention of opening any more parks, even though he has received hundreds of letters by mail and e-mail from people who would like to park in his own neighbourhood.
Instead, he focuses in San Antonio on providing educational facilities for adolescents with special needs.
"I know that there are many different organizations that are trying to build something like Morgan's Wonderland elsewhere, and we will continue to work with them," he adds.
He's still taking Morgan to play the theme park -- Morgan's kind of a celebrity there now.
"When he comes here, he's like a rock star!
Many people want to talk to him and take a picture with him, he can handle it well," says Hartman.
Morgan, who is now 23 years old, is getting better and better at things.
"He is now speaking more and most of his physical problems have been resolved by numerous operations.
We're so proud he's come this far."
When Morgan visits the park, she likes to play the swings and the sandy area the most, not knowing how much she has helped others.
"Morgan knows the park is named after him, but I don't think he understands what it really represents and how it's changed lives," says Hartman.
"He doesn't understand that the way he's handled things in life has made him a real source of inspiration."
U18 team head coach Vaido Rego: Play-off game can decide one or two shots
The Estonian U18-age basketball team defeated Poland 68:63 in the quarterfinal of the home EM B division, and the head coach Vaido Rego said that this was a real play-off meeting.
The game was rough.
Both teams had done their homework, the dots came hard.
It's a matter of having better nerves.
Play-off could be a one or two throws game", discussed Rego.
Victory, yes, but first, the coach is still looking for something to fix.
You can always complain.
Some of our mistakes were not justified, the opponent received easy free throws and lived on them.
This has happened to us before - if you go aggressively to defend, there is a risk of overdoing it.
Let's draw our own conclusions," said Rego.
He was using nine players today. Robin Stone was still on the bench for missing a few encounters because of the damage.
These decisions are made on an ongoing basis.
The stone did this morning's training and pre-game warm-up, but was still not 100% ready," explained the supervisor.
Tomorrow at 18.15, Estonia will meet in the semifinals with Great Britain, who defeated Bulgaria today at 76:73.
The winner of this game will raise the EM A division for the next summer in the U18 age class of his country.
Video: Vasiliev has already overcame the second penalty for the new club
At the ninth minute of the game held in the home square, Pia was at a loss against Wroclaw Slask, but was able to tie 20 minutes later.
Vasilyev had a great opportunity to secure the first victory of the season.
Four minutes before the normal time came, the quarterback missed the penalty.
The match ended with a 1:1 draw.
Piast has collected two points in four rounds and is located in the league table at the penultimate, or 15th place.
How do you keep sex exciting when you're trying to have a baby?
So it is very important to keep the flames burning even when you are trying to create a new life.
Female First gives advice on how to make sex look like a pain in the ass.
Don't take it as an obligation.
It could happen to any couple who try to get pregnant.
Sometimes it may take years for you to become pregnant.
Sex on orders takes away spontaneity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel unable to enjoy "normal" sex at the end of a cycle when it is known that a positive result will not come.
This creates tension in the relationship, which in turn leads to a decrease in sex, and less sex, of course, means an even greater opportunity not to get pregnant.
However, men feel that they must be able to "pretend" when they are required to do so.
If you know your fruitful days in advance, it can help you plan something romantic with your loved one.
Whether it's a special dinner or just spending time together - enjoy yourselves!
Consider the fertile period.
From the point of view of reproduction, there is no point in having sex when ovulation has taken place, but in order for your relationship to flourish, try to have sex for pleasure on non-fruitful days.
Although there is no evidence that pregnancy is more secure than a woman has an orgasm, do not forget that!
Remember, each pair is different.
Everybody handles baby stress differently.
Some men want to be familiar with a woman's cycle, while others prefer not to know that they don't feel the pressure to "require".
No one knows better than yourself how best to suit you.
Find your solution!
Studies have shown that couples who have sex every few days have a higher chance of success, but not every couple can keep that density.
The most important thing is to find the pattern that suits you best as a couple.
IAAF warns that frauds are being closely watched in the London World Championships
The London Athletics World Championship begins on Friday, and athletes are more in the spotlight than ever in connection with doping scandals.
These World Championships are the first to be guarded by a new body, the Athletics Integration Unit (AIU), which also monitors corruption, gambling and falsification of results.
"It can't be ruled out that people's nature does not allow such things to happen.
However, we can say that we have the best practices and the best anti-doping program that can exist at the moment based on information and data collection, and we will see the result after the event," said David Howman, representative of AIU.
AIU has allowed 19 athletes to compete as neutral athletes of some 190 Russian athletes caught with drugs.
Review: Levadia destroyed Paide City Team in the home square
Levadia has put herself in a difficult position because in the previous round, Viljandi's Future was surprisingly lost abroad, and table leader Flora took advantage of the opportunity, slipping seven points away.
From behind, however, Nõmme Kalju has reached the same stick as Levadia.
Paide, who has been in prison during the summer transition window, continues to miss the captain and the mid-field maestro Andre Frolov.
Of the last seven games, only two draw points have been picked, the league table has the eighth place - four points behind Tartu Tammika and four points ahead of the future.
For Levadia, Paide lost 0:7 in the first game this year and 2-5 in the second.
"My watch died, but I didn't," the actor Raivo E. Tamme smiled wide in the finish line of Ironman 70.3.
True, during the whole half-long triathlon, a smile did not seem to leave Raivo behind.
What's more, running 21.1 kilometers, he got into a conversation: "I talked to someone on the run, a man ran by and wondered, "Lord, you can still talk!"
At the runaway dance, Raivo, who had enough energy to tell the story, went on the fast walk a few times.
Coach's advice.
"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that you can walk uphill, that there is no point in running, because there are such ups and there is little difference in time as to whether you run or make a quick walk," says the actor that he listened to the advice of the triathleted instructor.
At the same time, he was able to catch his breath during walking times, and therefore, after crossing the finish line, he was able to share interviews to the left and to the right without breathing.
It's like there's no 1.9 kilometers of swimming behind you, 90 kilometers of cycling, and 21.1 kilometers of running.
"I think that my training is also such that I can enjoy this competition," admits Raivo, who started training in January and who has lost 16 kilograms of his body weight today, in a contented way.
And as for the interviews, it was my wish that I could do interviews after the finish.
I've been able to do interviews since every competition, and I was hoping it would be nice to be able to do it after Otepää Ironman.
I thought it would be all right if I wasn't down on the bleak after Ironman." On the contrary to the fascinating bleak-in-the-earth state, Raivo offered a completely different picture when crossing the finish line: his hands triumphantly towards heaven and his face glowing with a sincere triumph.
There was also reason: Raivol took 46 minutes and 24 seconds to swim 1,9 km, 90 km to ride 3 hours and 32 minutes and 21.1 km to run 2 hours and 18 minutes.
"My heart has now been given to the triathlon," says Raivo, who already cried in the finish line that he gave his finger to the sport, and it took the ring to the takkahta.
Already registered on August 20 to Gran Fondo - 230 kilometers from Tallinn to Tartu on a bike!
So, practice again tomorrow!
Disney's longtime advisor and leader Marty Sklar died at the age of 83.
Sklar, who died in his home in the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood on 27 July, maintained ties with the company after his retirement in 2009, precisely scheduled for the 54th anniversary of the opening of Disneyland.
Last year he became the only member of the Shanghai Disney Company in China on the opening day (so the company invites its employees) who has participated in the opening of all 12 Disney Parks around the world.
And less than two weeks before he died, he attended a Disney fan convention in D23, sharing memories of Disneyland.
Disney Company reported his death, not to mention the cause.
He was 83 years old.
Sklar's post as editor of The Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to Disneyland after graduating from U.C.L.A. in 1956 to work in its advertising department.
He soon became Walt Disney's main shadow author of advertising material, dedications, souvenirs, speeches, slogans, presentations and short films, such as a piece of writing that helped the company to obtain approval for the construction of Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also worked with Walt and his brother Roy on Disney's annual reports.
"These were quite dizzy times for a person who only approached his 30th birthday and had only six or seven years since graduation," wrote Sklar in his autobiography "Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms" (2013).
However, despite Walt Disney’s trust in Sklar in his writings, he appointed Ford Pavilion at Sklar World Fair 1964, where Disney Company designed exhibitions and attractions.
Sklar wrote Walt Disney a story about the Ford Pavilion attraction for Magic Skyway, where animatronic dinosaurs and cavemen could be seen and which was their main link to large corporate sponsors.
It was the beginning of Sklar's second act in the company.
As a growing member and head of the Imaginers, he was increasingly tied to Walt Disney's legacy, who died at the end of 1966 long before Walt Disney World was opened in 1971 and Epcot was opened in 1982.
After Walt Disney died of lung cancer at the age of 65, Sklar was thrown back into the writing world when he was told that the company's executives had not prepared a public statement, although it was no secret that Walt was dying, as he writes in his autobiography.
Sklar said he was upset that he had to write a statement that Roy Disney was signing, but he realized that poor planning was a sign that Walt Disney's death had paralyzed the company's managers.
"In fact, they were all scared to death," wrote Sklar.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in February.
His father, Leon, was a teacher and his mother, Lilyn Fuchs, worked at Johnson & Johnson before his family moved to Long Beach, California, when Marty was 12.
After high school he had several temporary jobs, for example, he worked at Douglas Aircraft, ice cream shoveling in the hamburger restaurant drive-in, and as a parcel carrier for postal services.
But in May 1955, when his third year at U.C.L.A. was coming to an end, Sklar received a message to call Disney's marketing and advertising director, E. Cardon Walker.
Back then, Sklar U.C.L.A. was the new editor-in-chief of the student newspaper The Daily Bruin.
Walker asked him to come to the newspaper The Disneyland News for a job interview with the creator and editor of the post.
Walker said the theme park would be opened soon.
And it needs him.
Walker hired him after a 20-minute interview.
But Sklar had to prove to Walt Disney that he knew what he was doing.
"I worked there for two weeks and had to present Walt Disney's page concept," he recalled on a podcast on the Disney Avenue website.
"If Walt didn't like it, he would have thrown me out the door and hired a professional.
But fortunately, Walt liked it.
I was 21.
That was scary.
I had never worked on a professional level."
Sklar formed Walt Disney (and some other person) lessons at one point "Miki's Ten Commandments" or the Manifestist of the Board of the Theme Park.
Commands include, for example, the following: Know your target audience.
Try to "get into the shoes of visitors" to experience attractions like them.
Tell only one story at a time for each attraction.
The theme entertainment expert Bob Rogers once called Sklar the "wizard's apprentice" - the role Miki-Hir played in Disney's film "Fantasy" (1940) - because he had brokered Disney's philosophy to three generations of designers.
His wife, Leah Gerber, daughter Leslie Sklar, son Howard, and four grandchildren, leave behind Sklar.
Sklar was Disney's committed leader.
He regularly wore three mike-miire watches (which showed him the time in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and a Mickey-miire gold ring.
And he never forgot anything Walt Disney taught him.
When the Disney Company developed the California Adventure Park Children's Area, Sklar reminded the planners that they added activities that parents and children could do together, as Walt Disney had demanded.
"I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed because Walt used to take his daughters to Diane's and Sharon's Griffith Park on a carousel ride," he said to The Los Angeles Times in 2002, "and Daddy had to sit on a park bench and eat peanuts and popcorn while the kids drove alone."
Police took over 200 people to the station during Weekend.
In total, more than 20 crimes were registered in the city of Pärnu during the festival.
There are reasons to associate about half of them with the music festival, while large amounts of narcotics and two drunken driving were recorded alongside the use of violence.
The hundreds of misdemeanour proceedings started were mainly related to the use or possession of minors or banned substances who consumed alcohol.
There's been a burglary and a violation of public order.
For various reasons, police officers brought over 200 people to the police station.
About half a hundred of them were minors, and the main reason for delivering alcohol to the police station was alcohol.
Last year, there were twice as many minors brought to the station.
A half a hundred people were also taken to Kainenema, perhaps as much as they did last year.
According to Andres Siineri, head of the Pärnu police station, the above numbers are expected given the large crowd.
As in previous years, we were thoroughly prepared for the weekend this year.
We brought in additional forces from other precincts, police cadets and auxiliary police forces to ensure that we were ready to react quickly.
Most of the situations were solved with a word, and it was enough for law enforcement to communicate with citizens.
"A lot of bad things probably didn't happen, because the police were in the city to see and feel enough in our estimation," said Siineri.
In his opinion, it was extremely positive that the number of young people who drank alcohol was clearly less, and the young proved that they could celebrate soberly.
He commended the security company's top-level team who took care of security in the festival area.
I thank all the festival guests who behaved politely and feasted safely.
"I would also like to thank the local people who, with their understanding, contributed to the success of the grand festival," said the police chief.
Pärnu Police Department is waiting for owners on weekends for items found in the city and festival area.
According to Annika Pärna, the manager of the Pärnu service, who was responsible for returning the finds in the festival area, there were fewer items lost this year than last year.
More than half of the findings were returned to the owners in the festival area police tent.
The largest number of bank cards, identity documents, mobile phones and keys were lost within three days.
"Currently 13 mobile phones, three wallets, a laptop, a smart clock and several car keys are waiting for the owner at the station," said Pärna.
A 101-year-old man jumped off a plane.
World War II veteran Verdun Hayes recently received a military award to celebrate the skydiving jump of his world record.
In fact, at 101 years and 38 days of age, the man committed a feat, becoming the oldest person in the world to have made a parachute jump.
A business group rushes the government to agree on Brexit's transition conditions
One of the largest business lobbyists in Britain encourages the government to stop dancing around Brexit’s outskirts.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) appealed to the government for a "transition agreement" to make progress with Brexit smooth.
They want the government to create a bridge over the Brexit salmon between leaving the EU and establishing new trade agreements.
The group warned that, without such a contract, "short-term chaotic rock-side swings" would be in the way of business.
They criticised the government for being involved in "the transition in all kinds of speculative disputes".
In recent weeks, members of the government have presented controversial views on how long the transitional period will last and what this will entail.
The IoD report 'Cleaning the Brexit Salmon - Opportunities for Transition' states: 'Instead of emphasizing the problem from a distance, the government must create a strategic debate around this issue.
This could minimise the growing confusion and uncertainty in this area."
Gerard Lyons, economist and leader of the Economists for Brexit group, however, this week described the concern over "the rocky edge" of Brexit as "the talk of panic producers", reminiscent of Y2K's fear of computer programming at the turn of the millennium.
Early Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in June: "There is a large number of business investments that will be postponed until companies see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions is."
Allie Renison, head of IoD's EU and trade policy, said: "The Chancellor has the right to worry about delaying business investment.
This is one of the most frequently considered changes that need to be addressed in relation to Brexit, alongside the relocation of operations to the EU.
The latter applies in particular to IoD members in Northern Ireland who are currently considering co-location or relocation."
IoD proposes a number of options, including the following: Extension of Article 50 agreement from March 2019 onwards
Accession to the European Economic Area
Consent to stay longer in the area of government of EU legislation
Establishment of a transitional customs agreement similar to that of the EU Customs Union
Renison said: 'The IoD proposed these opportunities in connection with the transition, hoping that it would spark a proper debate on how best to finish Brexit.
Prioritising intermediate arrangements and thereby mitigating the risks of exit from the EU means that short-term chaotic fluctuations at the edge of the cliff will not diminish future opportunities."
Russian railway explores the possibility of starting a St. Petersburg-Kaliningrad-Berlin passenger train
The Russian railway investigates the possibility of launching the Berlin-Peterburi train route through Kaliningrad, informed Viktor Golomolzin Interfax Severo-Zapad, the director of the Kaliningrad railway.
The monitoring of passenger traffic tells us that from an economic point of view, it is hardly possible to start the Kaliningrad-Berlin trains again.
And we offer another route - Berlin-Kaliningrad-Peterbur.
There are technical possibilities for this both in infrastructure and rolling stock", said Golomolzin.
Golomolzin also noted that there are already Russian trains on which the gauge can be changed and the European gauge can continue to move.
Golomolzin considers this direction to be promising, because today the people of St Petersburg and the entire north-western part of Russia have to travel to Germany through Moscow and Brest.
As a possible option, the route will be discussed through Latvia, the Latvian railway spokesperson for the Latvian railway (Latvijas Dzelzceļš) Māris Ozols, who said that there is currently no specific decision, but the option is under discussion.
Latvia's railways, together with their partners, including Russia's railways, are seeking to increase competitiveness in the provision of passenger traffic so that rail transport can compete with road transport.
Pakistani Hindus Can't Find Asylum in India
Seventy years after the largest population migration in the history of the separation of the two countries, prices are still moving from Pakistan to India.
Tens of thousands of people, who do not even have the legal right to work in India, are already waiting for them in the hardy camps on the border between the two countries.
Thus, many have no choice but to engage illegally in quarrying near temporary habitats - the Indian authorities are watching very closely the movements of those who come to the border on the other side.
Most people from Pakistan do not expect such reception.
No work, no house, no money, no food.
That's where we worked in the fields, we were peasants.
This is where people like us are forced to break rocks to make a living," said 81-year-old Jogdas.
For us, the division is not over.
Hindus are still trying to return to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing," added an elderly man living in a field camp near Jodhpur.
After India’s independence from British colonial rule in 1947, over 15 million people lost their homes.
Secession caused a wave of violence for months, in which at least one million people lost their lives because of hatred for religion.
In the midst of bloody chaos, Hindus and Sikhs fled from the newly formed Pakistan, while Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite emigration, prices are still one of Pakistan's most numerous minority groups.
According to various estimates, they account for about 1.6 per cent of the country's population of 200 million.
Many complain of constant discrimination and fear robbery, rape, and forced marriages.
"The persecution began soon after the separation," said Jogdas, whose family moved just a few months before the division of two countries to escape the drought to the areas of the current Pakistan.
Not a day went by when we could have lived in peace.
I wanted to come back to live among my Hindu brothers.
The national government of the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Mod, has said that it wants to make it easier for those persecuted for religious reasons to find refuge in India.
Last year, the government started to allow immigrants to apply for citizenship at their place of residence; in the past, the whole business was done through the central government.
After seven years of living in the country, the Hindus who relocated from Pakistan to India have the opportunity to gain a high-speed citizenship.
However, because of bureaucratic delays, this process is often much more time-consuming.
Khanaramji, a 64-year-old, left Pakistan in 1997 and received Indian citizenship in 2005.
Many, however, say that they have given up and returned to Pakistan because they see that they are not looking for a good life in India.
The government doesn't provide any support.
We're like cattle without a owner.
Just trying to survive on our own," said Khanaramji.
But even worse than poverty is the scepticism of the authorities.
Those who do not have citizenship must suffer from harassment by intelligence agencies.
They are always treated as suspects and Pakistani agents," he explained.
Since then, he has been disillusioned.
During the regime of Mod, tensions between India and Pakistan have increased and migrants are the ones who suffer the most.
"The rest of their lives will turn into hell," said Sodhal.
For many, however, such treatment is better than life in Pakistan.
Horoji fled with two adult sons to India two years ago because he had begun to receive death threats from his Pakistani neighbors.
"In order to save our lives, we had to flee to India," said Horoji, aged 65, whose grandparents came from the areas of the present India, but found themselves on the wrong side of the border as the country splits.
My grandfather moved to the other side for work.
But he told us to move to India at the right moment because he knew the future might be dangerous to the Hindus.
I think we've done pretty well.
We have done well with our work and activities," says Pärnu Police Manager Andres Siineri, how Weekend has been working for them for the first two days.
Sinimeri says that today there are police officers and quick responders on the streets, and they are also communicating with people - perhaps they have questions and they also want to know how to become a fast-tracker.
In two days, police have had to deal with some fights, as well as drug cases.
"There have also been some handling of a large amount of narcotics, but we will take stock when Weekend is over," says Sinimeri.
About a hundred people have visited the Pärnu police station within two days.
Fortunately, the police did not have to solve extreme cases.
By the way, Sinimeri says that if the sky comes sharply and horizontally, they don't have much work to do.
One of Haapsalu police field leaders has once said that rain is like an extra patrol.
Pärnu police have also made a headquarters in the Weekend area, where you can take what you find and from there you can also ask for your lost things.
By the way, the police even lost one of their necessary gadgets that the good people took to the spot.
Check out the video Andres Siiner told the Evening Paper.
Several writers and producer Neal Baer, who received Emmy's nomination, paid $4.35 million for a home in Hollywood Hills West, which dates back to the atomic age.
In 1945 Josef Van der Kar designed a modernist house in the middle of this century and named it Wohlstetter’s house according to its original owners, Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter nuclear weapons strategists.
The 255-square-metre house located along the entranceway, which is limited by the gates, has wide glass sliding doors that open the garden, terrace and courtyard.
In the living and dining room there is a cork flooring, a fireplace and portable panels that open the kitchen.
The main building consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
There is also a separate guest house with a view to the giant fish pond and the sleeping porch.
There is also a bathroom and an additional storage room in a separate building.
Albert Wohlstetter was a powerful nuclear strategist during the Cold War.
Roberta Wohlstetter's analysis of intelligence failures prior to Pearl Harbor's attack was also quoted by the September 11th Inquiry Commission.
The Wohlstetters have advised both Republican and Democratic Presidential Administrations, including John F. Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis.
They received a presidential freedom medal from Ronald Reagan in 1985.
Baer is best known for his work in TV dramas called "Criminal Hospital" and "For Law: Sexual Crime Investigation Unit".
The real estate agents were Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane from Deasy/Penner and Partners.
The buyer was represented by Hattie Ramirez of Keller Williams Realty.
The plane drew the perfect image of itself over the United States.
The pilot took the passenger plane on a zigzag national flight over the United States and managed to have some fun on the route.
The aircraft’s real-time flight path data indicated that it was not just a straight line or an arc, but a series of flight paths that formed the image of the aircraft when connected.
Flight BOE004 left the Boeing Field airport at Seattle local time approximately 3:40 p.m. on Wednesday according to Flightradar 24, which monitors real-time air traffic.
Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took the eastwards across Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota before abruptly changing course and flew south-west.
From the map, the strange route of an aircraft represents a two-engined passenger aeroplane.
Boeing says the flight is part of an 18-hour "durability" test for the aircraft.
"Instead of flying with any pattern, the testing team unleashed their imagination by driving on a route that formed a 787-8 contour over 22 states," said a representative of Boeing Company to RT.com.
"Dreamliner's nose points to Puget Sound, where the home of Boeing Commercial Airplanes is located.
The wings range from northern Michigan near the Canadian border to southern Texas.
The tail touches Huntsville i Alabama," he added.
Boeing long-distance aircraft 787-8 Dreamliner was introduced in 2009.
The aircraft can accommodate up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 1,300 miles [1,300 km].
Since the pilot used the radar as a personal canvas, flying on the web created a huge interest among aircraft watchers.
Some suspected that it was a test flight, while others suggested that it might be a strange coincidence.
Estonian children’s dress style-related cartoons
While in Europe and America, children are often shaped by what is currently carried by children of royal families or celebrities, Estonian parents choose clothes for their children on the basis of what is happening on the screen.
British little Prince Georg is becoming a real fashion guru, following the example of a mother, Duchess Cahterine.
Like his mother, a prince can unleash in people his clothes a real shopping frenzy that has even received its own concept - the effect of Prince George.
The last such event took place a few weeks ago during a royal family visit to Poland, where George wore a Spanish brand Tizza with a ten-euro blue-red striped iron shirt bought by mad parents in 24 hours from the online store of the brand.
Shoppers from Estonia probably didn't have many among them, because the king's clothes of children are supposed to leave our parents totally cold.
Anna Ansmitt, communication manager of the department store, admits that the children of star couples and foreign fashion trends generally do not affect our parents' purchases to their children.
In Estonia, films, cartoons and Youtube canals are the biggest indicator of the purchase of children’s goods.
So the most popular products in recent years are finger guns, cartoon "Frozen" characters games, dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, hatching penguins and so on".
At the same time, he assures us that if you wish, you can dress your children in Estonia like European princes or princesses.
The Centre Party does not recommend the Savisaar Association
The leaders of the districts of the Centre Party all over Estonia made an appeal to the public and to the parties, calling on the Centre Party to vote in favour, not in favour of electoral alliances.
This message is primarily addressed to those who are considering the Edgar Savisaar Electoral Union and the Centre Party.
How Princess Diana used her makeup as a weapon
When I think of Princess Diana's makeup, the first thing I see is the eyeliner.
Younger girlish blue.
Later on, a thick black wave line in his Martin Bashir's "Panorama" interview, the effect of which was devastating when he looked up through thick eyelashes, bringing out an immortal phrase: "We were three in this marriage, so it was a little too crowded."
The big, wet eyes, surrounded by his gloomy, pale face with a thick black line, made him look like a wounded animal.
That's exactly what he was trying to achieve.
Outside the public, however, Princess Diana never wore much makeup, at least not according to modern standards.
It wasn't just that he didn't need it - he was beautiful, of course - but he saw it as a tedious duty, something to do with work rather than pleasure.
In front of the public, he may have worn a thick layer of makeup.
Once he arrived at the office of Conde Nast, the publishers of Vogue, wearing a thick, almost orange make-up cream.
He apologized, saying that his skin would have to shine out of the sun, because if he went out "normally", the buzz photographers would take pictures of him and then make all the accusations that he looked "blow", "mute" and "tired".
It was for this reason that Diana visited the tanning room three times a week using a machine in her home.
Today, of course, such a course would be resented for health reasons, but for Diana, it had a useful purpose - it allowed her to show the world her sunny nature, even though her interior was filled with black clouds and lightning.
Perhaps one of the biggest mistakes of the royal family was to think that if they approve of him as Charles’s husband, they would have a beautiful little female, with only cotton candy as their brains.
The reality, however, was quite the opposite.
He may not have been top of the class at school, but when it comes to creating an image, he was a straight-A student.
For Diana, the importance of hair and makeup was that they could be used to convey mood or feeling.
Otherwise, he had no interest in them.
Her friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was the godmother of her youngest child - remembers that makeup was nothing they used to talk about.
"I only remember this," he said, "how relieved he felt on those times we went to rest together and he didn't have to put on makeup."
Today, we tend to think of makeup as something that improves a woman’s appearance, but looking back at Diana’s life course, it is clear that she used it as a powerful public relations tool.
The moments when he felt most at ease were his own most, the moments when he was also the most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, with his two young sons in Thorpe Park, driving down the Loggers Leap attraction, he was soaking wet and laughing from the heart, eyelashes scattered under his eyes as any other mother who spends the day with children.
Four months after the announcement of her and Charles' breakup, she finally looked defiantly carefree and "ordinary."
Or in later years, lifting out of the gym, putting your hair on the back, putting your legs in uniform in bicycle pants, your face red from your training, your health and life force blowing out of every pore of his.
Toward the end of his life, when he began to assert his independence and his confidence grew, we saw more and more of this Diana.
He joined the Halo Trust and walked through the Angolan minefield in January 1997.
At the age of 35, her hair was soft and natural, her face almost completely free of makeup, she probably looked prettier than ever, remembering this bright and hopeful young girl who smiled on an engagement photo 15 years ago.
Diana was just getting into her best years.
Back in the day, young Diana Spencer had a dream-like pre-Raffael nature.
But it didn't take long for the "Princessification" process to begin, a process that was conducted mainly by the press and the palace, to make Diana a refined young girl worthy of her new status.
Part of it involved Clayton Howard, a veteran makeup artist often used by Lord Snowdon on photo sessions.
Howard met fearful Diana for the first time at the Town Hall in Snowdon, Kensington, to capture the official engagement picture for Vogue magazine.
At that point, in the late 1980s, Diana was still an empty canvas.
His finest beauty products came from The Body Shop, such as the Elderflower eye gel.
Howard used Max Factor's make-up cream Sheer Genius toned Honey Touch and Max Factor's cheekstick toned Frosted Coral.
On the eyelids, she wore Elizabeth Arden's tones Rice and Timberland and a white frosty eye shadow.
Elizabeth Arden’s blue mascara and blue contour pen improved her appearance.
And we know all that because Howard created a facial scheme for him.
"Diana's eyes are such an admirable color that I wanted to highlight their striking blueness," she wrote later.
The end result, however, is not very flattering for such a young girl - she looks like an 18-year-old who is about to turn 50.
His eyebrows are too oppressive, and his eyes are carrying too much boring brown.
But the most striking is the infamous eyeliner at the inside of the eyelids in the blue tone of the ghostly Disney Princess.
Fantasy for a fantasy bride.
No wonder Diana looks a little insecure at us.
One source of Diana's anguish was the fact that she never knew where the public person would end and start private.
This was the beginning of this process.
The person who probably influenced Diana's appearance most likely was Mary Greenwell, who still plays an important role in today's makeup world.
The make-up artist, who is currently an ambassador to Chanel among others, is still one of the icons of the make-up world.
"Diana had incredibly beautiful skin and long limbs," she recalls.
"She was just beautiful.
The men worshipped him.
She was sexy without trying."
Mary met Diana for the first time in 1991, when Anna Harvey, Vogue's mastermind at the time, asked her to make makeup for Diana before the December photo session with Patrick Demarchelier, one of the most valued photographers in the magazine.
Sam McKnight, the hairdresser, was also part of the team.
It was when Diana and Charles had the biggest marital problems and there was a struggle for public support.
"They didn't tell us who it was, even though we knew it was someone very famous," said Greenwell.
"When we got there, Diana was just standing beautifully there, warm and friendly, and extremely excited to be on the cover of Vogue."
This cover - Diana in a simple black sweater, her chin leaning on her hands, her blue eyes bright, her nails elegant French manicure, her hair cut short - was groundbreaking.
It radiated positiveness, individuality and elegance.
Above all, it was modern, conveying the minimalistic aesthetics of the early nineties, and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the royal family, who were faced with a "dose of horribil" as the queen later called it.
"Diana was very relaxed about her makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and different," said Greenwell.
Over time, she taught Diana to make herself makeup - cream, make-up cream, hidestick to raise her eyes, mascara - and stressed a healthy skin care routine, encouraging her to take good care of herself and to follow the mantra of "internal beauty".
Diana "did everything in moderation," says Greenwell.
He slept well and reduced alcohol consumption, which is very important for fresh - looking skin.
The princess preferred Guerlain's makeup cream, Clarins lipsticks and Clinique's Wild Rose blush.
But the biggest favor Mary did to Diana was weaning her off the blue eyeliner.
"It just made him so much older," he said.
Instead, he used a combination of soft brown and neutral tones with a brown pencil line at the eyelash border, which was blended with each other, so that all edges were beautifully soft.
Often, she simply used tonic cream and a little sun powder to emphasize Diana’s healthy brilliance.
"Diana used to call me and invite me to her house to discuss products that I loved to do," Greenwell told me.
"I think it was relaxing for him; a chance to take a few moments for himself."
His favorite was the luxury brand Clarins.
Diana allegedly used the day and night cream for their sensitive skin and the cleaning milk and toner with their Alpine herbs.
She also went to the beauty parlor of cosmetologist Janet Filderman on a regular basis.
Diana had famously beautiful skin, but sometimes she had rosacea, moderate cheek rash, often due to stress.
To alleviate this, he used natural soothing oils, including brisket oil.
"Diana had a magnificent bone structure," said Greenwell.
The only part of his appearance he wasn't very confident about was his nose.
Anna Harvey recalls, "Once the newspapers wrote that she had been doing beauty surgery with her nose, she turned to me and, laughing, said, "Honestly, if I had had had my nose operated, do you think I would have chosen one?"
As Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight began to solidify the advice, Diana felt more confident about her new appearance.
One of his most memorable public appearances - in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he wore the famous "hand tax dress", a provocative, naked shoulder figure from Christina Stambolian - shows that the signature style of her late life began to develop.
Diana is sexy and dynamic at the same time with short hair brushed behind her ears, her short hairstyle in sharp contrast with the very challenging black silk dress.
His makeup is perfect - flattering but at the same time modest, black eyeliner accentuating the blueness of his eyes.
Without fear of bright colors, especially red, he wore a shiny red nail polish, most likely Revlon Red, which in some ways became a trademark.
A few months later, he flashed his elegant red manicure when he was lansing his childless fund at the Royal College of Nursing.
The princess was a model of health and self-confidence.
And finally, he also had complete control.
In tan and uniform, his makeup flawless, he conveys exactly what he wants the viewers to think: here is a woman who seems to have a sense of self and a purpose in life and who has finally found her place, having just received 36.
It's a real shame he couldn't prove it to himself.
Southwestern Japan preparing for the arrival of typhoon Noru
A large part of south-west Japan, including the areas that were devastated by rainfalls last month, prepared for even more rain on Friday than the typhoon Noru, which was at one point the strongest storm in the world this year, drew ever closer to the main islands of the country.
According to the Meteorological Office, in the south-west of Kyushu Island and some 1,350 km from Tokyo, the Amami archipelago will be hit by strong winds and heavy rainfall on Friday south, and in the next 48 hours it will be possible to rain down up to 800 mm of rainfall.
A representative of the Meteorological Office said that Noru, which marks a certain type of deer in Korean language, would probably turn north and water Kyushu in the rain, although the northern parts of the island, which were hit last month by rains and floods that killed 36 people and left four missing, are likely to escape the worst.
"This is an extremely slowly moving storm," he added, stating that there is therefore a greater risk of flooding, as in one region rains a great deal over a longer period of time.
Noru, which at one point was a category 5 typhoon and is an unusually long-lived storm, formed first two weeks ago and wandered in circles along the North Pacific before heading northwest, targeting Japan and weakening its approach path.
The representative added that, depending on the change of course, Noru may move directly across Kyushu and then along the island of Honshu Japan, but it is still difficult to identify the longer journey.
There are places on the landscape where, if necessary, conventional vehicles can't get to even if they want to do the best.
There's the solution to ATV.
The ATVs, which are used in the military field, gave an overview of the Home of Defense!
There is nothing new about the use of such lightweight and high-permeability vehicles in military structures.
The need for them arose already during World War II, but more attention was paid to them a decade later.
Simplicity and robustness
As early as 1956, M-274, which was known as a mechanical mule, was rolled out of Willys Overland’s factories by the development of a vehicle designed to evacuate wounded in the final years of World War II.
It's a little strange to name a mechanical mule for further development.
It's hard to imagine a more ascetic vehicle.
Wheeled platform, seat and steering wheel: all, the whole luxury.
It's as if you've stolen too much of the designs from the engineer's desk and started production quickly.
But in war, convenience is much more important than permeability.
There was no match for a mule tested in the jungles of Vietnam in this category.
A light machine weighing less than 500 pounds [500,000 kg] could barely escape even in places where Willyse Jeep, who had collected the mythological element with its superpermeability, had to display the brake lights with surrender.
The bulk of the vehicles with a load of nearly 500 kg were used for transport operations, both for the transport of money and for the carriage of live power.
At other times, lighter, non-reciprocated anti-tank weapons were also installed on the mule’s back.
However, such a truck came under fire, and it still did, and in the latter trouble, the driver was able to move the steering system forward and let it so low that it was possible to drive the vehicle on his stomach lying down.
The foreigners were produced until 1970, completed by 11 240, and were in use in the army until 1980, when HMMWVs were replaced.
For the next two decades, ATVs had rather marginal significance in military circles.
They returned to the picture after the twin towers fell to the ground in New York City, and U.S. soldiers found themselves burying themselves in the desert landscapes of Iraq and Afghanistan.
It was there that the knowledge and understanding of the need for something to fill the gap between Humwee and the infantry man was born.
Since ATV generally does not provide considerable protection, they are not the best choice for combat tasks directly.
However, fast and light machines are suitable for special tasks.
For example, in reconnaissance and rescue operations.
There are now thousands of ATVs and UTVs in the American army.
Most of them, such as the XUV550d acquired for the Defence League, are essentially similar to those in civil circulation, but supplemented according to the needs of the army.
The names of Kawasak Mule, Hondalt Rancher and Foreman, Yamahalt Rhino and Arctic Cat, and the ever-expanding choice of Polaris, the leading military-ATV manufacturer, are represented from the brands that have been camouflaged.
In 2013, Polaris concluded a five-year contract with the American Special Forces Centre (SOCOM) for the supply of two-seat MRZR2 and MRZR4 and a separate five-year contract for the single-seat Polaris Sportsman-based MV850s with both infrared and black-out lights and innovative bee cell-like tyres, which ensure mobility even after being hit by a 50-calibre weapon.
Before MV850 entered the market, Polaris was able to deliver MV700 and MV800 vehicles to the military.
MV700 is a military version of Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman for civilian use, with the addition of winches in front and rear, a two-part fuel tank for greater distances, a reinforced frame and base and some other military equipment that farmers or just foresters do not have to start with.
As well as the successful John Deere M-Gators in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with the Polaris ATVs, it is equipped with gunrests, luggage racks on the hood and some other elements that are useless in ranches but are necessary in the battle zone.
A vehicle weighing 750 kilograms can carry almost 570 pounds [770 kg] of stuff.
The power of the engine is also sufficient to carry lighter trailers and cannon parts.
A variable-shaped box at the rear, whose sides are removable, allows you to drive from point A to point B baggage that is larger than the size of this small but tough insect.
Later, M-Gator also completed versions A1, which are 20 horsepower more powerful than the original 20-horse power M-Gator, followed by a reinforced frame A2, which is even better for carrying and towing loads, and A3, which combines the positive properties of A1 and A2.
The Fire Crosses actually received M-Gatores already in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, where the medical brigades used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they also reduced the load of soldiers on their feet by carrying stuff instead that would otherwise have to be carried on their backs.
If most ATVs in power structures are modifications to civil vehicles, there are also some exceptions.
The most prominent of these are the warhorses made in Phoenix International, called Prowler, which have been used successfully on all kinds of battle, intelligence and rescue missions around the world.
According to the manufacturer, in the case of these vehicles introduced for the first time ten years ago and set up for special operations, they have been overcome by bottlenecks specific to the ATVs in normal use and also to those which have been modified by the army, both in terms of controlability, durability and safety.
However, being similar in construction and in size to normal ATV, Brewler is totally different in design and performance.
It is faster, more durable, more stable, and can carry more weights than other similar vehicles.
For example, if, in the case of normal ATV, the driver has to play continuously with his body position in order to maintain the balance of the vehicle and use both hands to maneuver, accelerate and brake, driving a Prowler is more like driving a car.
In the end, however, it doesn’t matter whether they all have the same concept and the same field of use as Prewler, Gator, MV850, or any other ATV or UTV.
And it is clear that in circumstances where defence costs are generally reduced and smaller-scale, target-oriented sussing is practised instead of a large-scale conventional war, light-weight and fast light-duty vehicles have joined the army in order to remain in service.
As a result of the division's clutter, sensitive data on vulnerable children in custody was released.
As a result of a worrying breach of information, the mother of one child was mistakenly sent personal data of the children under care, including information on their sexual activity.
A table containing the names, dates of birth, locations and specific points of concern and attention of all children under the care of a large service provider in Victoria was sent to the mother by e-mail.
The e-mail revealed every child's place of residence.
The list shows that a 13-year-old boy is released against bail and shows sexual behavior, that a 15-year-old girl who has problems with self-harming, abuse and running away from certain substances is "out with her boyfriend" and "not coming back tonight", and that a 14-year-old boy needs help with "care for himself" and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The table appears to be a handover document intended to be sent to the night shift supervisor.
The document contains notes on when to wait for a child to come home or whether they can contact staff to catch up with them.
Some children have been given alarmingly many details.
For a 15-year-old boy, it is written warningly: "If personnel contact to obtain permission to search the room and/or review the laptop/USB device due to suspicion of inappropriate sexual material, this authorisation must be granted."
The document also states that in the case of a 17-year-old girl who will be 18 and released from institutional care in just three months, the risk of suicide attempt is so high that the staff must call the emergency line immediately if she escapes.
For a 16-year-old paroled boy, it was noted that he was outside and "will contact the staff later to be picked up".
Although only the name of the accommodation unit in which the children are held and not their addresses are mentioned for the listed locations, there are still sufficient details to enable them to be found.
The 2015 data leak came out when Mother shared her experience with Fairfax Media in relations with the Ministry of Health and Service and Child Welfare since her daughter was taken into custody four years ago.
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had turned 18 and left the system.
The heartbreaking decision to hand over her daughter to child welfare was made after a violent incident at home, one of the increasing number of domestic violence complaints submitted by parents against their children.
For example, within six months of leaving home, her daughter was able to receive seven criminal charges, moved hundreds of miles away to her home and to her environment, where she seemed to be successful, but then moved back without informing her parents, and her nurses accepted and facilitated the relationship between her daughter and her older husband.
The relationship with the first of these boyfriends, the 17-year-old with whom the welfare institutions allowed a woman at the time to stay regularly at a local hotel, ended when a young man was charged with having sex with a child a few days after he turned 18.
"Why did she get out of the system worse than when she entered it?" says Mom.
"And will this happen to all the children under care?"
He is strongly in favour of setting up an institution that will enable the Ministry of Health and Services to monitor children during the first weeks after they have been taken into custody before they move home.
This would enable them to better understand how children communicate with others and the risks and needs associated with them, especially educationally.
The state government is looking for new ways to reduce the need for children to be placed in home care, including by seeking better support for their parents.
The targeted aid packages, financed over four years with $62 million, aim to help transplant children from home care to better-organised situations.
In addition, the $5.6 million two-year experiment, which was announced last October, allows professional carers to be offered to at least 28 children to help them get out of welfare or avoid getting into it.
According to the department’s representative, the information was not officially reported when it happened, although Mother claims to have informed two of the department’s employees within a few months of the incident.
The department is now working with the service provider to analyse the case.
"Every alleged leak of private data is taken very seriously. We are working to ensure that this has not had a negative impact on the young people concerned."
In July last year, Jenny Mikakos, Minister of Families and Children, commissioned an independent review of a sample of privacy incidents in child protection during a five-year period.
The department agreed with the seven recommendations made as a result and has since updated the Child Protection Guide to ensure that staff clearly understands their roles and privacy-related activities, changed IT systems to prohibit the automatic aggregation of certain personal data, and formally reviewed the privacy-related functions of the Department.
The Australian Bank of Commonwealth Bank is accused of serious money laundering offences
On Thursday, the Australian Government prosecuted the country's largest mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank, for widespread violations of the rules against money laundering and terrorist financing.
The AUSTRAC Financial Intelligence Agency disclosed that they had initiated a civil penalty procedure against CommBank in the Federal Court of Justice on the basis of a "serious and systematic non-compliance" in Australia's largest case of its kind and the first one where a large bank was accused.
"CommBank's behaviour in this matter has left Australian society unprotected against serious and lasting financial crime," said AUSTRAC in the court document.
Commonwealth Bank stated in its statement that they would investigate the accusations more closely and answer "when the time is right".
Australia's largest mortgage lender did not report "at the right time or not at all" suspicious facts about "transactions involving a total amount of over $77 million ($61 million) in Australia," stated AUSTRAC.
According to the Agency, the Bank has committed 53 700 violations of anti-money laundering and terrorist financing, in particular with regard to so-called "intelligent contributory machines".
The previous biggest case of this type earlier this year was Tabcorp Holdings, Australia’s most popular bookmaker, who had only 108 alleged violations.
Tabcorp paid $45 million in fines, and this is the biggest civilian penalty in Australia’s corporate history.
AUSTRAC’s representative refused to comment on the possible punishment of CommBank or on whether other banks might be in the line of fire of the Agency.
The maximum penalty for breaking the law against money laundering and terrorist financing is USD 18 million per violation.
Intelligent ATMs are a specific type of ATMs that receive deposits in the form of both cash and cheques and facilitate anonymous cash deposits.
According to AUSTRAC, the use of CommBank's intelligent cash-in machines has increased significantly since their introduction in May 2012.
Cash deposits amounted to USD 5.8 billion in the six months preceding June 2016 compared to USD 89 million in the first six months after the introduction of the CommBank ATMs.
AUSTRAC claims in the case-files that cash deposits were made from fake names, so the proceeds were received by drug-importing syndicates.
"Even after CommBank's attention was drawn to suspected money laundering or "smurfing" in Commbank accounts, CommBank did not start monitoring its clients in order to complicate and manage money laundering and terrorist financing," the court records show.
AUSTRAC added that CommBank's accounts were also used for "käosmurfiing". This is a form of money laundering involving transfers between countries without money actually crossing international borders.
Nordea and the DNB Pool will become a reality at the end of the year
The merger of DNB and Nordea Baltic units into a financial group called Luminor will only take place in the last quarter of this year, says Äripäev.
The opening of doors in the common legal body has been delayed.
Following the publication of the merger plans last summer, the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter.
In April, however, DNB's communications manager said it would be pushed to the third quarter.
In particular, the Swedish Financial Supervision Authority gave additional instructions to Luminor for compliance with the regional importance of the Verbundbank.
Trump called New Hampshire "narkourka," pissing off state politicians.
"The President is wrong," said Chris Sununu, Republican Governor of New Hampshire.
It disappoints me that his misdescription of the epidemic ignores all the great things the state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, the Democrat of New Hampshire, called the remarks "absorbing" and said on Twitter that his state is no different than any other that combats widespread abuse of opioids.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, as well as the Democrat, agreed.
"It is totally unacceptable for the President to speak of NH in this way," he wrote on Twitter.
It's a complete misrepresentation of the NH and the epidemic.
Opioid addiction - a category of drugs that includes heroin and fentanyl - is the most deadly drug epidemic in American history.
Drug overdose killed more people in 2016 than weapons or car accidents - an estimated 59,000 according to the data analysed by The New York Times - and is now the main cause of death for Americans under 50 years old.
In 2015, more than 97 million people in the United States used prescription analgesics, according to the Agency for substance abuse and mental health.
It is estimated that 12 million of these people did so in a way that was not prescribed by a doctor.
New Hampshire has been hit hard and its inhabitants repeatedly raised the problem to presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign.
In New Hampshire, in 2016, an estimated 470 overdose deaths were reported compared to 439 cases in 2015.
In 2012, there were 163 statistics from the New Hampshire Ministry of Health and Service.
On Thursday Sununu described the opioid epidemic in e-mail as "one of the worst health crises the state has ever faced".
He said that the government has doubled resources dedicated to prevention, treatment and recovery.
According to him, the state has also spent millions of dollars on child prevention programmes, law enforcement to stop drug trafficking and initiatives aimed at making the naloxone used to treat overdoses more accessible.
Call for drivers in connection with the rape of two girls in Witton.
Police are trying to find two drivers in connection with the rape investigation of a 14-year-old girl.
The teenager was attacked in Birmingham in the Witton area on July 26 at around 02:00 (BST).
Before that attack, he was raped at Witton Station.
There's been an indictment on the first case.
The British Transport Police would like to speak to two drivers as part of the investigation.
Police say the first car is a light-colored sedan.
Detective Chief Inspector Tony Fitzpatrick said: "We have reason to believe that the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim at the station before the other person picked him up and then raped him in the car.
We would like to know what was said during this conversation, and the leader may also know important details that will help us in our investigation."
According to the police, the driver of the second vehicle, which was described as red VW Sharan, probably took the victim home after being raped for the second time.
For this weekend, rainy appearances will be allowed, so it would be time to take a proper exercise.
Why not trim the leg muscles?
You're Gorgeous gives recommendations for nine exercises that should help you achieve leaner and better toned legs.
Supposedly, the first changes should be seen after the first week of training!
Although the weekend has arrived, your actions have not faded.
Still busy with your hands and feet, trying to spur other people on fast.
You might want to forget your concerns and hit the exit with your boyfriend.
Take your time to enjoy each other’s company in some cosy, romantic place.
Speaking on an exciting subject, you go on fire, make big plans, maybe make promises... which you'll forget a moment later.
The other party will remember your words.
I guess it's kind of unsettling. It's hard to focus on something.
Your feelings may not depend on what is happening now, but on things that have taken place before.
Even when you are in a difficult situation, you can act quickly and rationally.
It's possible you're helping someone out tonight because you have the wisdom and the determination.
Rather, stop worrying about financial and business matters.
Take time to rest and relax.
Going to a crowded event can be exhausting and frustrating.
It is possible that you may accidentally find yourself in a situation where there is a serious dispute in which you must vigorously defend your views.
If the others get out of line, don't you do it.
You will feel better in a normal environment, doing what you can and what you enjoy.
You're probably not thirsty for new knowledge and adventure right now.
Having fun is an activity you probably never really get enough of.
You're gonna get company tonight, too.
But what happens at a party may not be normal.
It may be that despite your day off, you still have to deal with some real trouble.
Or maybe you're physically at home, but you're still thinking behind the desk.
If you want sharp experiences, travel can do that.
The adventure vortex grabs you, you have to pull yourself together to stay on the crest and keep your balance.
Don't waste your energy arguing about finances.
Take up this issue only if the situation really requires urgent and decisive intervention.
Why do dogs bite the grass?
Sometimes people think a dog eats grass when he's not feeling well and wants to throw up.
In fact, most grass-eating dogs are perfectly healthy.
Only less than 10 percent of dogs eating grass do so because of a disease.
One reason why a dog can suddenly start eating grass may be a poor diet.
Even dogs with worms may become more interested in chewing grass.
Thus, if a dog who has never chewed grass has suddenly developed an appetite for grass and often eats it, it is worth checking with the doctor just in case, for example, to quickly identify a possible problem with the digestive system.
It is worth mentioning that a dog can eat grass even because it likes its taste or because it is just bored.
If a health problem is excluded, it is worth making sure that the family’s favorite is able to do enough creative and entertaining activities.
Thunder clouds come from the West to Estonia.
There have already been noises and few flashes in Northern Estonia.
This afternoon, the weather service issued a thunderstorm warning.
Today there are mainly thunderstorms in Northern Estonia.
Thunder clouds move fast from west to east.
"Exclusions of advanced wind range from inland to 15, on islands and coasts 18 m/s, but thunder may be accompanied by stronger winds", says the Weather Service website.
However, a significant increase in thunderstorms is raging in south-eastern Finland and in Russia east of St Petersburg.
Fortunately, however, winds in Estonia blow from the west and southwest, so at least for the time being, there is no danger that larger storms will turn on Estonia.
Sylvester Stallone plays a guest role in the second season of "Our Life"
The lead producer, Dan Fogelman, announced on Thursday on the Television Critics Association press tour in the framework of a series-related forum that Sylvester Stallone will be performing in the second season of the NBC’s popular drama series.
As a guest, the actor performs the role of Kevin’s (justin Hartley) co-star in film shoots at the beginning of the season.
"Kevin plays in a big movie and we needed a big co-star," said Fogelman.
At the end of last season, Kevin was hired to play an important role in the film staged by a glimpse of Ron Howard.
This season, we will see how the character participates in the project and also warms up relations with his ex-wife, played by Alexandra Breckenridge.
According to Fogelman, Stallone is playing the father figure in the film in which Kevin participates.
The "Our Life" star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays in the past pictures of the series Hartley's father, played the son of Stallone in Rocky Balboa in 2006 as a coincidence.
Fogelman said that the still flourishing Ventimiglia friendship with Stallone was probably what helped the show attract a big star as a guest actor.
"We have a great scenario for him.
I believe this will be truly exciting," Fogelman said.
"Our Life" returns to the TV screens on September 26th.
In the United States, two elite university employees were arrested after national hunting.
42-year-old Northwestern Professor Wyndham Lathem turned himself in to the police in California after the police had been looking for him.
Andrew Warren, a 56-year-old employee of Oxford University, was captured by police officers in San Francisco.
Men are suspected of being brutally stabbed by 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau.
He was found dead in Lathem's apartment in Chicago at the end of last month.
A few days later, suspects made a large donation to a library in cash under the name of the dead.
According to a member of the Chicago Police Department, Latham sent a video to his friends and family about the biggest mistake of his life.
CNN didn't see the video, and the police won't release it.
The police said it was a brutal murder, and his body was transformed because of his wounds.
Warren had recently arrived in Chicago from Great Britain, but the investigators have not determined whether and how he was familiar with the victim.
Before he was arrested, both suspects fled the state.
Elise Christie talks about how she got over Sochi's horrors and cyberbullying to skate again for gold.
Compared to this fragile young woman who recently considered saying good-bye to the Uissusadium, 26-year-old Christie has changed beyond recognition.
Evil insults knocked him out, especially because he had been bullied when he was a child at West Lotian school.
At present, he is full of confidence and believes that the test may come back to its origin, bringing at least one gold to Pyeongchang.
"I wish to go out as an Olympic winner," he says, without fear of specifying the purpose.
"I feel that I am at the right point, both physically and mentally, to cope with this."
He once dreamed of a career as a figure skater until aesthetic elements began to diminish that interest.
"I was a very good jumper, but I had trouble looking for art," he said laughing.
"I wasn't very good at elegance, in order.
It was a sensible choice, because short-track skating is best suited to my personality."
A woman walks around the world on foot: I have a daily budget of $5!
To be honest, I have had this experience too, but it is true for 40 days, where I decided to live the life of "grace" in southern France just to be free and live the day at a time.
Got overnight in a tent, woods, small-town stations, etc.
In the second week, I joined a French "unhomeless", a 44-year-old man was...
Oh, don't think about it: We just stayed in the same park in Mentones and became friends, although he was 15 years older than me, he was good company.
Turns out he's from a good family, Paris, a former French Navy officer.
You don't drink alcohol, you don't commit suicide, in other words, a decent person, intelligent, pleasant communicator, seen life.
In short, I joined him and for the next three weeks, we wandered from town to town and about 5€ a day.
The money came, so much you'll live.
The man taught me how to offer help at night on the terraces of closed hotels and restaurants and on the farms on the way.
We worked just enough to have food money for the next two or three days, and then...
At some point, I got a fever, and I decided I couldn't...
I took a flight home to Helsinki.
And by the way, I still regret it.
Those 40 days must have been the best in my life.
In Indonesia, a man who stole three audio amplifiers from the mosque was burned alive by the Hungarian news agency MTI.
A 30-year-old thief snuck out of the mosque of Bekas near the capital of Jakarta on August 1, but the shrine guard spotted him and shouted, "Take the thief!"
They came to help, and they immediately pursued the thief.
He escaped on a motorcycle and even swam across the river.
The chase lasted a few miles, then one stone thrown into the chaser's head, causing a serious injury.
An enraged mob of chasers caught a thief and beat him up.
One of the chasers spilled gasoline on a thief and set him on fire.
The innocent died of burns at the scene.
The body was delivered to East Jakarta Police Hospital.
The police took possession of both the dead motorcycle and stolen audio amplifiers.
At first, reports appeared in the local press, as if it were not a thief, but rather an electrical repairer who said he wanted to repair the amplifiers.
However, the police strongly refuted these claims.
The relatives of the deceased reported that they would not report what happened.
According to the German news agency, dpa, the reason for this step is that Indonesians do not trust the police or judicial authorities.
Indonesia is the largest Islamic country in the world.
Of the 255 million inhabitants, 87.2% are Muslims.
Australian cuisine: from finger-wide to schoolyard.
From indigenous Aborigines, modern Australian cuisine has inherited finger limes and kangaroo meat.
British roots have also had a lot of influence on the food table there - like Vegemite, a dark brown salty beer yeast spread with butter on bread or crackers, like the British Marmite.
Meat pies, or meat pies in a dough wrap, which are served with boiled potatoes and sauce, also come from the British.
There are also UK-origin BBQ Snags, or raw sausages, baked by Australians on a grill, while British tend to be in the oven.
One of the local sweets is the Pavlova beseetort, although it is also called the invention of the New Zealanders.
The sweets also love crispy Anzac cookies with coconut and oat flakes and coconut-chocolate-coated cupcakes with lamingtons.
Honey Joys, the bear's joys are called honey cornflake balls.
Australian Cooking Celebrity Stephanie Alexander and her life's work, the kitchen Bible of home chefs "The Coke Companion", which is in at least half a million Australian homes. / Blake Storey, Prime Creative Media
This autumn Stephanie is celebrating her 77th birthday.
His father was a civil servant and his mother Mary loved food very much.
Stephanie studied library at the university, and as Australian youths do, she also went to discover Europe after her studies.
While traveling in France, Stephanie’s food love only developed and settled.
In London, however, he met his first husband, Monty, Jamaican roots, with whom they opened a simple diner in Melbourne in 1964.
Ten years later, the marriage broke and the restaurant closed the doors.
In 1976 he opened Stephanie's Restaurant, a restaurant for a somewhat wealthier people, which was one of Melbourne's most valued dining places for the next 21 years.
A restaurant of significant importance is still spoken of as the first fine dining place in Melbourne, which really was able to value fresh raw materials and offered seasonal food - a fact that now seems to be the truth of abbits, but it was not yet there at the end of the last century.
Since his withdrawal from the restaurant business in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing cookbooks, 15 of which have been published from her pen.
There are even more productive food writers in Estonia, but in his case, no book has simply been a recipe collection.
For Australian chefs, the various Stephanie Alexander cookbooks have been irreplaceable.
For her life's work, however, the lady considers the fifth cookbook, the most popular "The Cook's Companion", now in at least half a million Australian homes.
The book was published for the first time in 1996, with a revised release in 2004 and the latest version in 2014.
In my bookcase, this issue of 2004 takes up quite a lot of space, because the impassant book contains about a thousand recipes on 1126 pages!
The latest option, however, is even more extensive.

It is a real cooking Bible, where, in addition to recipes, the purchase and storage of different raw materials is addressed, the cooking technologies are introduced and recommendations are made for the purchase of kitchenware.
Foodstuffs are in alphabetical order, and there are many cross-references in the work - obviously the education of the library did not run down the sides of the food writer.
Stephanie herself stresses that it was this book that changed her life and gave a new direction to her future activities.
Because of the popularity of the book, the feeling that he has something to give to people led to the next major kitchen garden project, which in our circumstances is comparable to school gardens.
The fourth Estonian person had a heart in Finland.
According to doctors of the North Estonian Regional Hospital (PERH), cardiosurgeon Gunter Taal and cardiologist Pentti Põdra, who participated in the surgery together with Finnish medics, the post-operative period has progressed as expected.
"It's very hard to say how long a patient could have lived without a new heart," said Moose.
According to doctors, the world has now lived with a heart pump for a maximum of eight years.
The man himself is still recovering and is not ready to talk about it.
He was first diagnosed with heart failure two years ago, and the disease had already reached its final stage; heart failure was caused by ischaemic disease.
"For this patient, the transplant was the only option," Taal added.
According to the cardio surgeon, after the transplant, the patient no longer has any batteries or wires with the heart pump.
All he has left is a scar and a cure to suppress immunity.
The patient can exercise and generally lives on like a normal person," he said.
First year is the most dangerous.
The elk added that full recovery would take three to six months.
According to both doctors, the patient should regularly monitor their medication; however, the medicines also have side effects.
In addition, the patient should be monitored to avoid rejection of the donor organ.
The most dangerous is the first year, but according to ISHLT, or International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantion, 50 percent of the patients live for more than ten years.
He said that Helsinki had better results and that 25 years of transplanted heart were the longest.
The cardio surgeon explained that because of the disease, the patient’s circulation was poor, a heart pump was put on him a year ago, helping him to recover for surgery.
When his pulmonary artery pressure dropped, he became a suitable candidate for transplantation.
The transplant operation is not considered very complicated in Taal's opinion to be surgery: the correct timing is very important.
"It took a lot more time to get the pump and then get the heart when you put a new heart in," he said.
In addition, as a complex part of the surgery, the cardiosurgeon brought off the extracorporeal circulation.
Rather, he said that heart transplants can be considered extraordinary because they are the least needed by Estonians.
Kidney, liver and lung transplantations are more significant.
Well, there's still excitement in a rare harvest, but we've been practicing this job for many years.
Learning about yourself and your nervous system is an art of this profession," Taal added.
Four more people need an organ.
According to the Taal, the patient had a heart because the body was not suitable for any other patients living in the Scandiatranspland Community.
The Scandia Transplant is an organisation for organ exchange with members from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
There are currently four other people on the heart transplant list in Estonia.
"These are still counted patients," stressed Moose.
According to Taal, the longest waiting time is for big men with a 0-positive blood type.
"In Finland, there is a queue of about half a year", he stated.
There's a lot of conditions to get a heart.
"A woman's heart is usually not suitable for a man, the heart of a great man for a small and so forth," listed the cardiosurgeon.
How to finance company vehicles?
In a changing consumer society, the financing opportunities for companies' vehicles have expanded – alongside the practice, more and more companies are also using full service leases or even more duty-free long-term car rentals.
The leasing and rental of a vehicle are two distinct financial transactions involving different obligations and expectations, but often confusing.
According to Villi Tõldi, sales and marketing manager of the international car rental company AVIS Estonia, companies are increasingly moving towards full service leasing and the possibility of long-term rental is also being used.
The carriage highlighted the main questions to which you can choose a suitable way of using the vehicle.
How long to use the vehicle?
The biggest difference between car rental and leasing is the time of use.
"Lease is preferable to a longer-term vehicle if the company has plans to introduce commercial vehicles for a longer period", Tõld explained, adding that it is worth deciding to own a vehicle in favour of full service leasing or long-term rental if the vehicle is intended to be used as a service, i.e. a car on a daily basis, but leaving maintenance obligations to the service provider and giving up property.
"The rental car has a much shorter use period than the leasing period, but many major car rental companies also offer long-term car rentals, where car rental takes place without complex contracts and with a free return", Tõld introduced various car rental options.
Who will own the vehicle?
At the end of the tavalising, the tenant becomes the owner of the car.
"In the case of full service leases, it is possible to continue with a leasing payment at the end of the leasing period under the same or better conditions, with the replacement of an equivalent new vehicle that meets the needs of the company", he said, stressing that as the consumption society is increasingly moving towards service-oriented consumption, the ownership of the vehicle is an additional obligation for the company.
In addition, in the case of full service leases, it is possible to buy a car on the basis of a wish and agreed terms.
However, the option of renting is not available and is paid only for the period of use.
Car rental usually takes place at car companies’ offices and car rentals from rental offices of rental companies.
Car companies are primarily involved in the sale of vehicles, but also offer leasing and, in some cases, car rental.
However, rental companies have cars for the sole purpose of renting them out.
The carriage said that the reasons for using the rental service are different - many companies rent public vehicles, it is also convenient to use the service when travelling or on holiday, or when their car is in repair.
"In the case of commercial vehicles, there is a growing transition to full service leases, which offer customer transparency of costs, time savings in the purchase, use and return process of vehicles and greater comfort", the sales and marketing manager introduced a growing leasing trend.
Every year, more and more companies use full service leases for their fleet, thus optimising their spending and focusing on their core business.
What is the coverage of service-based insurance?
In the case of a leased car, the car is usually covered by basic insurance, and it is also necessary to decide whether to include, for example, emergency insurance, theft insurance or full insurance. "However, if you compare the tax treatment with full service leasing, then the customer will receive more with the equivalent monthly payment, as in addition to the vehicle and insurance, the monthly payment will also cover regular car maintenance, 24-hour assistance, tyre change and other agreed services," explained Tõld.
"If any new vehicle can be taken into the ranking, in the case of a full service lease, the service provider will help to choose a vehicle that meets the wishes and needs of the company, which also takes into account the functions of use", he compared, stressing that a full service lease will definitely help to optimise the costs of the company's fleets.
"However, the choice of rental vehicles depends on the car park of the service provider – different rental companies offer both a small and economic vehicle for use in urban traffic and a luxurious sedan for business meetings," said Tõld.
During a tight rental period, it may be that the car you want has already been rented out, but early booking of the vehicle you wish will help against it.
If you choose between leasing or renting, you should first clarify your goals - how long the desire to use the vehicle is and what are the long-term plans for the car.
It is certainly worth looking carefully at the different conditions and obligations of the services.

The United States Navy veteran received an order to remove the American flag cover from the mailbox.
Retired US veterans and Florida's Homeowners' Union are at the heart of the ongoing dispute with the American-flagged mailbox.
Erus US Navy Officer John Ackert says he received a letter last week from the Tallahassee Southwood Housing Community Association asking him to remove the national flag cover from the mailbox or face punishment.
He told WCTV he wasn't going to give up without a fight and he's filed an appeal.
"I regard it honestly as bullying," said Ackert.
And I think that people should fight bullying in any form, especially one like that.
Ackert said that, according to the Homeowners’ Association, its mailbox was not in line with Southwood’s aesthetic values.
U.S. Navy veteran John Ackert said he was ordered to remove the American flag wrapper covering his mailbox.
"We ask you to remove the American flag cover from the mailbox due to the approach of the end of the season," the letter forwarded.
Ornaments may be outdoors 30 days before and must be removed after 15 days at the latest.
He said the wrapper's been out for four years.
It got there 30 days after we moved into the house.
Messages to the Southwood Housing Community Association were not answered immediately on Thursday morning.
Some of Ackert's neighbors told WCTV that the letter was a bit harsh, and they were not particularly surprised by the activities of the Homeowners' Association.
"They do these things all the time," said Mike Stephenson.
I think it's ridiculous.
Why can't you be patriotic in your country?
Mike Patel said, "It's a veteran who served our country.
It's just a mailbox with a flag.
I don't think that's right.
He owns the house, at least he can afford it.
The letter from the Homeowners' Association states that Ackert has 15 days to remove the case, otherwise he will be fined.
He hasn't been able to get an answer to his appeal.
Vietnam "repents" on German kidnapping charges
On Thursday, Vietnam said that he regretted the comments made by the German Foreign Ministry, accusing the Vietnamese intelligence service of kidnapping the former Vietnamese oil company, which was wanted at home on the basis of the embezzlement charges.
The German authorities believe that Trinh Xuan Thanh was taken from Berlin, leaving the Vietnamese intelligence attachés 48 hours on Wednesday to leave the country.
Thanh is facing charges of embezzlement involving the death penalty in the event of conviction.
He searched Germany for asylum, but his application had not yet been processed when the Vietnamese authorities demanded his extradition.
The representative of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Le Thi Thu Hang, told reporters that these comments were "extremely regrettable" and Thanh turned himself in to the police in Vietnam on 31 July.
"Vietnam always considers it important and wishes to develop strategic relations with Germany," he said without going into details.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after being initially charged with unfair management in a subsidiary of the national oil and gas giant PetroVietnam, with losses of some USD 150 million.
The Vietnamese police issued an arrest warrant in September.
In March, the police launched an investigation to investigate the acquisition of his alleged involvement in the real estate development project.
Other information: Member of the Taliban Supreme Council.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was released from the legislative body before its first session in the month following.
He was also expelled from the Communist Party.
The Vietnamese Ambassador to Germany was invited to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and was informed that Germany would request that Thanh be returned so that asylum and extradition procedures could be carried out correctly.
The bus driver rescued eight puppies from the driveway, not knowing that the dog actually has the owner.
"Where I put these eight puppies, a woman would have thrown me out of the apartment with the dogs," joked the bus driver Oleg, who saved the unattended puppies by the driveway, handing them over to the shelter worker.
Soon, however, the owner of the dogs appeared in the shelter, for whom he did not understand why the puppies were taken away from his home.
The Harjumaa bus driver Oleg said that he had already worked as a bus driver since the early 1990s, but such a case has not occurred before in his career."I took the bus number 146 on my usual route.
Near the Harju Cross, I noticed there's something small running around the side of the road.
I thought it was a raccoon, but it turned out to be four puppies," said the bus driver.
Oleg was heartbroken and stopped a bus full of passengers to pick up the puppies.
"Unfortunately, cars would have run over them and crushed the dogs," said Oleg.
He added that the passengers were reasonable, and they too were greatly enjoyed by soft dog children.
The puppies were a little scared at first, but then they got fun.
Puppies on board, the bus driver went into a new round because the schedule needed to be followed.
While driving past the cubs' spot again, he saw four other little dogs right there.
They were German Shepherd puppies.
They were so fluffy, and it was immediately seen that they had been taken care of.
The dogs were beautiful, amazing.
The first thought, of course, was that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason", the bus driver said that for this reason he decided to carry the puppies into the bus.
"I picked up these four puppies and called the police," said Oleg.
The lawkeepers contacted the Tallinn Animal Shelter, whose staff came after the puppies after the Baltic Station.
But wasn't the driver tempted to take the furballs?
That was the idea.
One dog boy was so beautiful and peaceful.
Sitting pretty like a grown dog," said Oleg.
But where do I put these eight puppies?
I would have been thrown out of the apartment by a woman with dogs.
We still have a little kid.
It's too early to get a dog," he added.
The head of the Tallinn Animal Shelter, Eve Tobias, confirmed that 8 German Shepherd puppies, two and a half months old, were brought to the shelter.
But that same day, the owner came back for the puppy family.
"We didn't even sign those puppies up and give them back for nothing," he noted.
"The dog owner wasn't very upset, but he said they had the only house in sight and the bus driver could have asked if they owned the puppies," said Tobias.
However, the head of the shelter added that it was also good that the bus driver picked up the brats on the side of the road and therefore there was no accident with them.
In fact, it was very good for the driver to react!
Jordanian court enforced life sentence for killing three US military personnel
Jordanian military appeal court sentenced Jordanian soldiers to life for shooting three US military trainers last year.
Last month, the military tribunal appointed Sergeant Major Marik al-Tuwayha at the entrance to the South Jordan airbase for killing Americans for life in prison with hard work.
Al-Tuwayha opened fire on an American caravan claiming to be afraid of attacking the base.
However, the video released after the decision showed that he continued to shoot even when two Americans hid and waved their hands to stop shooting.
Hala Akhbar, a news site related to the Jordanian army, announced on Thursday that a military appeal court with five judges confirmed the al-Tuwayha sentence.
James Harrison spends about $300,000 a year to keep his body in a form of play.
Each NFL player depends on his body to earn a living.
As a result, many other athletes invest a lot of money in maintaining and restoring their bodies to stay in top shape.
Jeremy Fowler from ESPN.com looked more closely at how far some veterans are willing to go to prolong their careers.
However, no case is as extreme as that of a 39-year-old James Harrison, a player in the rear line of Pittsburgh Steelers preparing for the 14th season.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends $300,000 a year on acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractors, and stacking.
Most of the costs are related to travelling across the country to meet specialists.
"I don't have to keep track of these things," said Harrison.
"If you compare what I earn with my expenses, payments are worth it, given how I feel."
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and teammate at Steelers, estimated the annual cost of looking after his body at $200,000.
Thirty-year-old Mitchell has tested body temperature, which Fowler described as "the use of 55 kilos of metal as a massage roller".
"It's rolled on you instead of rolling on it," said Mitchell.
"If you have a tight spot in your leg and they start moving this thing around, sometimes it hurts.
But when you get up, the pressure will be gone.
It just beats the tension out."
They're willing to make extra efforts, but former NFL players Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris spend an average of $50,000 a year on recovery.
Cofield, who played for 10 seasons in the New York Giants and Washington Redskins, has expressed regret that he did not spend more.
"If I could go back, I would invest even more," said Cofield Fowler.
"I'd probably eat at least twice as much.
I was in very good health for the first eight years of my career.
Towards the end, more procedures might have helped."
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old rear line defense player, expressed his willingness to follow in the footsteps of his veteran Steelers teammates.
"If you pay $100,000 and earn an extra three million by playing, this decision is quite simple," said Shazier.
As far as the long-term nature of a career is concerned, investing in the recovery of players is much smarter than spending money on cars and villas.
The average NFL player is lucky if he can play for more than 30 years of age, the more Harrison's success should convince his colleagues to shift his spending to another place.
But maybe they can just find a local specialist.
The Baltic boss of the Weekend Festival Gunnar Viese tells the evening newspaper that the festival was first acquired from Finland years ago and its owners visited the beach strip next to Riga for expansion, while on the way back they stopped in Pärnu and the festival was sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says they've set a target of 25,000 visitors a day, but chicks will only be counted when the festival is over.
Preparations for this year's party started last September.
"We had information from the city that construction would start on the previous site, there would be a hotel," Gunnar says about the change they had to face this year.
Right now, you don't see any stumps in there, but I think if the stump didn't go down this year, it's the next one.
So perhaps we should have moved away sometime," she explains why the festival area has moved this year.
The festival arrangement goes through the year.
People work on Weekend between a thousand and a half thousand - policemen, commanding teams, volunteers, traders, security teams, and so on.
According to Vies, the hardest thing was for Weekend to perform the duot The Chainsmokers.
After all, men are now the indisputable number in the pop music world.
Why it was hard to get The Chainsmokers to Weekend, and how does Gunnar comment on two artists canceling their performances, just watch the video.
The bike in response to Ansip: we have done a lot for Estonia's success.
European Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip said in an interview to Chronicle that he was sad to watch Estonia’s everyday policy, as Jüri Ratas’s government has turned a simple and predictable tax system upside down.
In Chronicle magazine you took the opportunity to ask me what I have done for Estonia's success and what I can be proud of.
I am glad that we have made many important decisions in the government as a good team and in the months we have counted, many of which have been expected in Estonia for over a decade," wrote Ratas today on social media.
According to Ratas, these decisions are, for example, a tax reform to increase people's incomes, pension reform to ensure a dignified retirement for the elderly, local government reform to balance the development of Estonia, increase in agricultural subsidies to revitalise rural areas and, of course, health care reform to provide accessible and high-quality medical care.
"I wish you a good vacation!" wrote Ratas in his address to Ansip.
Talents on Pärnu Weekend: A drunk man climbed into a strange car to sleep
Last night, at 3:00 p.m., policemen got a bit of a different challenge.
The owner of Audi reported that a strange man had climbed into his car and fallen asleep in a gas station near Port Artur.
The patrol who responded to the event found a man who, when the lawkeepers arrived, freaked himself out.
The man was tired for a moment on his journey and found a place in the back seat of a strange man’s car.
"At the wake of the law enforcement, the man returned to his way home," describes the prefecture of the West on Facebook.
Good ending, all good!

Pula Film Festival at the Roman Amphitheater, Croatia
Gladiators, blood, screaming crowd, muddy arena - such an image opened up 2,000 years ago in the Pula amphitheater in Croatia, where the international audience now enjoys films on the summer night of July.
For the first time, a screen was set up in a Roman building in 1953, making Pula’s film festival one of the oldest outdoor cinemas in Europe.
Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, John Malkovich and Ben Kingsley have enjoyed good movies under the sky.
The price is symbolic: evening in the Mediterranean with high-quality films means spending around EUR 3.
Sala Montjuïci open-air cinema, Spain
Next to the film, Sala Montjuïc offers a wonderful view of open-air cinema.
It operates on Mount Montjuïc, or Jewish, above Barcelona.
In the evening darkness of southern Europe, the moat of the castle on the hill shows the whole of Barcelona’s firemoll, which is a sight in its own right.
For July, the organizers of the moat will set up a large screen showing well-known films from La La Land to Manhattan 1979.
At the same time, up to 2,500 people can go to the cinema and 6.50 euros have to be paid for the entrance.

Cinema under the stars, Italy
A real nostalgic Italian breath can be experienced in the central square of Bologna, where on summer evenings the restored pearls of the local film archive are displayed.
Next to the tenth largest church in the world, San Petronio’s basilica, there are between 3,000 and 5,000 people who can watch old movies.
The northern Italian buildings, mostly during the 15th century lighting season, together with the warmth and good company of the summer evening, create a romantic atmosphere in which every crisp northerner melts.
From June 19th to August 15th, there is a new film in front of the audience every night, free of charge.

The stupidest questions to ask a bartender.
The Huffington Post relays the barmen's ears to questions they'd rather not hear.
What kind of drink do you do best?
Indeed, some drinks have more ingredients than others, but they require the same skill and skill.
Often bar attendants interpret this question as "What is the easiest/fastest thing for you to do now?", which signals them that the client does not care what he drinks, whether it is difficult or not to do it to the bartender.
What kind of drink do you like best?
This question is similarly interpreted to mean that what kind of cocktail would be the easiest to get from a bartender right now.
It's not for the bartender to say that. It's for the client to decide by the thickness of his wallet.
Rather, the bartenders would be waiting for the question of whether there are any special offers at the moment.
What's good here?
Perhaps behind this question is a sincere desire to know whether the bar stands out by any offers, but that could be asked differently.
Nor can a bartender predict what a customer would prefer.
Can I have a drink that's not very sweet?
Here, like the previous rule, a bartender is not familiar with your tastes and preferences, and what is sweet for one of them may not be sweet for others.
But he is willing to hear what flavors a cocktail might have.
Does this drink give me a headache/bucket?
Bartender's not a medic or a fortune teller so he knows how to afford it to a client with his hand on his heart.
The cold summer has driven Estonians to travel abroad so much that package travel is not only expensive but sold out regardless of price.
Even cheap airline tickets and last-minute tickets should not be expected; it would be wiser to think about next year’s travel plans.
A man hostaged a model with a plan to sell it in the dark web.
A Polish citizen took a British model hostage in Italy.
The man was planning on auctioning a 20-year-old woman in the dark web, or encrypted Internet, reported the Guardian.
Police report that she was lured to Milan on 11 July with a promise that she would get a job in a photo shoot.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
Supposedly, the captors tried to sell the woman in the dark web for £2,30,000 and made a ransom claim to her modeling agency.
The woman's captor, however, took her to the British Consulate on 17 July.
According to the police, the suspect is a Polish citizen, Lukasz Herba, who lives in Great Britain.
According to Corriere della Sera, the man discovered that the kidnapped woman had a small child and did not want to sell her as a sex slave.
Such experiments attract people.
It would be a good idea to keep thinking and drawing conclusions.
The suggestion to make friends in the background study of those who want to spend a little more time is obvious.
More generally, however, everyone could have a strategy that they share about themselves on social media.
At national level, however, we need to ask whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the threats to social media.
The lives of false people created under controlled conditions ended with summer school, but the lives of the natives certainly did not.
You have to go to the woods every now and then, for whatever reason.
But when the coolness gets between the skin, it's time to make a hot tea drink.
There are sufficient resources in the forest to do so.
The Home of Defense! gives a little insight.
The reason we are talking about tea is that coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which, although to some extent exhilarating, is not the best for our health.
When using plants in the wild, you must always be ready to test because both recipes and tastes are different.
Some plants do not need to be boiled for long, only by pouring hot water, while others need to be drawn for hours.
Of course, care must also be taken to ensure that water and plants are sufficiently clean.
It also depends a lot on the time and place of the harvest.
Let us now consider how to prepare a simple cup of tea, and what effect they can have on us.
Pine nutmeg
Pine nut teas can drink peacefully all year round.
If it is good to drink 2 liters of water per day, then this tea is well suited to satisfy the need for vitamin C and also give some extra energy.
As with all plants, useful elements can be obtained from pine needles using alternative methods, such as crushing - no need to boil thorns for long, raising hot water and leaving them to fetch for a few hours.
For half a litre of water, it takes 0.4 litres of thorns to be boiled for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink that contains almost 25 mg of vitamin C, a lot of potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 sugar cubes, i.e. about 20 kcal sugar.
Lemon and honey can always be added to pine tea to improve your taste.
And if the drink got really stiff, it could be diluted with water like syrup.
It's the same way to make a spruce tea, but the drink tastes a little different.
Raspberry drink is excellent and helps with a lot of problems, from rheumatism to pimples.
Raspberry helps to overcome fatigue, is pain-relieving and helps with colds, both as a relief of cough and as a reduction in fever.
As a result, you should not drink more than half a liter a day.
The raspberry drink also makes you sweat, so in winter you should find a more peaceful moment to enjoy it.
To prepare your drink in the winter, take fresh raspberries, and use leaves, sprouts or berries during the summer.
For half a liter of a drink, a small bunch of branches of good length are needed, which must be boiled until the water acquires a reddish tone.
You can also make a picture of the Raspberry Vartest.
To do this, crush the stalks and keep them in warm water for a few hours.
Longer and more thorough processing will also make the drink stronger.
A prepared raspberry drink can also be added to pine tea.
Black cobbler
Black hair is a woodhopper that looks like a black-burned piece on a tree in nature.
In most cases, it is found in birches, but elsewhere.
The use of the fungus is very broad - as a hot drink, to light a fire, instead of a incense, etc.
The ash can also wash very well.
Mustassics is a kind of super drink that can be used to treat or relieve a lot of diseases, even cancer, to increase tone, reduce stress, prolong life.
The fungus contains a number of unique compounds and many vitamins B as well as antioxidants and some minerals and proteins.
Mushroom teas can be drunk daily, there is no risk of overconsumption.
To make a drink, a piece of mushrooms about 3 x 3 cm must be boiled in 2-3 litres of water for 5-15 minutes.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited Vorms, Estonia’s fourth largest island in the framework of the small islands tour, where he met with local parish leaders and residents to discuss the current issues of island life.
The tour of Vormsi Island began in Sviby harbour, where Prime Minister Rata was greeted by the mayor of Vormsi parish Tanel Viks and the chairman of the parish council Ivo Sarapuu.
The first visit was to the historical church of St. Olavi and the adjacent cemetery, which is unique in Estonia for its limestone and sandstone ring crosses.
A meeting with Vormsi Kindergarten-Basic School followed, where Director Age Hälvin spoke with the Prime Minister about the living conditions of the school and the organisation of studies, according to which part of the school's students are in distance learning.
In the morning, the Prime Minister visited the new and modern joint operational service building opened in 2015, where he also had a meeting with the island people.
The discussion discussed issues of importance to the population, such as the development of ships and routes between the smaller islands and the mainland.
The state has committed itself to ensuring regular transport connections in the small islands with permanent settlements, but increasing traffic, for example, during the summer period, also complicates the important journeys of local residents.
These are places where the state can take local wishes and needs into account early and in the planning process", said the Prime Minister.
In addition, questions were discussed about the construction, recreational education, island safety and rescue capabilities of the small boat port.
Today's visit to Vorms was the last part of the Prime Minister's tour of the small islands, to explore the island's living environment and to discuss issues to be resolved with local residents and local government leaders.
In July, the head of government, Ratas Saaremaa, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi islands, and Manilaidu visited Naissaar, Prangli and Aegna during August.
For the first time, the Centre Party will go to elections without the founding and ideological cornerstone of the party.
So far, we said the Centre Party and thought of Savisaar or vice versa.
Now the Centre Party must find its way without him.
In doing so, they must also stage the party between the colorful, sometimes criminal and embarrassing past, the expectations of the party's supporters and the electorate.
The departure of Savisaar puts the Centre Party in the most difficult ideological situation.
According to political practice and ideology so far, an old rhino will play them over for sure.
A number of cards that used to act as trumps may not materialise this time.
The populism card does not work for the Centre Party because Savisaar can always afford more than the Prime Minister's Party.
It is difficult to play on the Russian card because of the position of the Centre Party in the government and because we can also see how the so-called Savinova Electoral Union is pushing down the gas.
Due to the ongoing trial, Savisaar's card is already in his pocket.
For the Centre Party, the map of the Popular Front and the poor's insults has also disappeared.
The first of these is a low value without its creator and the second is hindered by more forceful gaming by coalition partners in the government.
However, one card may be even more weighty.
All the last elections have confirmed that the political parties that can formulate and implement the main conflict in the elections are successful.
The main conflict has always revolved around Savisaar.
If any political party should have the idea of blowing life into a well-functioning confrontation, there will be another trump-up missing from the card deck of the Centre Party.
So what's left for the Centre Party?
They still have a strong party apparatus and a considerable resource.
There will also be plenty of cuttings before the elections.
Most of the shameless self-advertisement with taxpayers' money four years ago has hopefully now been repaid to the townspeople.
Tallinn’s city media are still available, but the practice of political guerrilla journalism has become even less widespread.
In addition, the party has voice magnets.
Their role this time will be to bring out chestnuts, because the image of the power party is not enough to motivate voters in a meaningful way.
Ideologically, Jüri Ratas must find his way, as the journey with clay isolation ended in this week.
Three U.S. Marines disappeared in a plane crash in Australian waters.
The U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps have completed a search operation, reported the naval base Camp Butler in Japan's statement, basically confirming that the military is no longer hoping to find the deceased alive.
There was an accident on a marine plane called Osprey MV-22, launched from the USS Bonhomme Richard.
There were 26 people on board the plane, 23 of whom were able to find and save.
Last month, a plane crashed into the sea took part in joint exercises between the United States and Australia in Shoalwater Bay, Queensland.
Australian Secretary of Defense Maris Payne said that a Saturday incident took place off the shores of Shoalwater Bay.
She found a strange wedding ring in the washing machine - who could own it?
"I started to take the laundry out of the machine when the light between the tire seals of the washing machine hit my eye," she says, "how did she find a strange wedding ring in her washing machine?"
In fact, Karin did not pay attention at the first swing of the washing machine’s door to the flashes.
I rebooted the machine.
"At the side of two little children, this dirty laundry immediately emerges," the woman mellows.
When the other wash went through, and I started taking the laundry out, it was still that light in the rubber seal of the washing machine that scratched my eye, and then I found this ring.
The gold wedding ring is engraved with the name of the man who married 14 years ago, Tomi.
Since someone in the family with this name, or a woman who could be married to one of Tom, doesn't know, the ring is a mystery.
Karin asked the older child that he might have found a ring outside, put it in his pocket, and the ring was in the washing machine through there, but the child assured him that he had not brought the ring home.
Karin and his cohabitation partner have lived in the apartment on Põlva Street in Tallinn for a year.
They used to rent it out, and the washing machine came from that time.
But if the ring had anything to do with the tenants, how did it end up in the machine?
"Now I'm unsolicited and can't tell which way the ring landed in the washing machine," she laughs.
Since the pace of life next to two small children is quite fast, it was first forgotten to find home on top of the closet.
"In recent times, there have been posts looking for the owner of the wedding ring, and now it seemed like it was high time to look for the owner of the ring he found," Karin refers to a case in social media where last week the wedding ring found on Puhangu Street in Tallinn found the owner happily.
"As they find and look for different things on Facebook, I thought I would try happiness there first", says Karin, whose post has already been shared by nearly 4,000 people.
"Postitute has received all kinds of feedback and not everything is good", sighs the woman, pointing out that with the first comments she was advised to take her husband on board.
Well, then I felt like I needed that shit.
That my husband has become the biggest cheater you've ever heard of.
To tell you the truth, I was worried at first, but later, when it came to the comments that maybe I myself had been messing with the owner of the ring, it made me laugh.
The commentators also suggested that the ring might have reached the woman in the pocket of the second round of clothing.
"Well, the last time six months ago, one of the other pants was bought for work, and it flew into the washing machine without a more thorough investigation, but really?" she's talking to herself.
Be that as it may, my partner and I agreed that now, for the sake of principle, we have to find the owner of the ring.
No matter what the reason for that ring's disappearance.
Divorce, family dispute or whatever.
I think it's the only right thing to do, because if I ever lost my wedding ring, I know I'd be grateful to someone who would try to find me and return valuable assets.
Karin has also turned to the Civil Status Office for assistance in finding the owner.
However, I received the answer that the gentleman has not married in Estonia on such a date and with such a name.
One ring has found its owner.
Recently, the owner returned happily to the wedding ring found in Pelguranna, Tallinn, on 21 July, the engraving of which allowed him to assume that it belonged to an elderly woman.
"I walked with the dogs this morning, and I noticed outside the 53th house of Puhangu, in an insoleed path, with a gold ring," says Gerli, "that the engraving said it belonged to an elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (on the photo) on her Facebook page and in the group "Integrated in Tallinn", sharing information with the North-Tallinn district and the North Prefecture.
Two weeks later, the police contacted Gerl and informed him that the ring bearer had been identified.
"I made contact with the owner's daughter, and on Monday night the find went into her possession." The ring was gone because the old lady had damaged her hand and put the ring on another finger, where it had slipped off.
"He lost it the same day the morning I walked my dog," says Gerli.
Although media attention has been focused mainly on Pärnu and its Weekend, it is not the only music festival this weekend.
The Intsikurmu festival in Põlva County also has loyal fans.
One of them writes on Twitter, for example, "I sold the Weekend ticket so I could go to Incitement."
And why not?
In addition to local artists, performers from America, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England and elsewhere will also perform there.
The festival in the magical forest surprises the artists there because of their charming location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, couldn't wonder on Twitter early this morning what a beautiful place Estonia is.
But the visitors haven't been a snitch at sharing fun things, either.

The Estonian U18 team acknowledged the superiority of Great Britain in the semifinals and the A Division will not escape
The match began at an extremely fast pace, and many baskets were thrown during the first quarter, which the British won by five points (18:23).
In the second quarter, the gap increased further, and a break was made in the nine-point success of the guests (31:40).
Estonia managed to win the third quarter, but only with one point.
The loss of Estonians before the last ten minutes was eight points (46:54).
In the fourth quarter, the Estonian game broke down completely and ultimately the loss had to be accepted with numbers 61:75.
The loss shattered Estonians' hopes of reaching the A Division because only two of the best teams will be able to get there.
In tomorrow’s third place game, Estonia will face the loser of the game between Croatia and Israel.
Police are searching for an Estonian criminal by postcard
Europol is after a stabster at the Tallinn Nightclub.

The Australian leagues are at a crossroads
Professional sport stands at a crossroads in Australia: some areas have traveled so far on a corporate road that they are too business-oriented to be classified as sports;
Others return to the world of amateurs, which is too sport-centered to be considered a business.
This confusion is evidenced by the painful delays of Cricket Australia (CA) in reaching a wage agreement with the players, the indecision of the Australian rugby union (ARU) in firing the team, the uprising of the Australian Football Federation (FFA) stakeholders, the difficulties of the ragbilii in assembling a functioning independent commission, and the relentless efforts of the Australian football league (AFL) to be the flag of social justice among the people.
John Wylie, the Investment Banker and Chairman of the Australian Sports Commission, have sought to actively lead Olympic sports along the same lines as professional leagues by placing businessmen in leadership positions who have no elite experience in sport.
The mining giant Rio Tinto, who has a reputation for using trade union tactic, was seen in the problems of Kollina CA in reaching an agreement with the Australian Association of Cricket Players (ACA).
David Peever, President of CA, is the former CEO of Rio Tinto Australia, and he has hired a leader and adviser of Rio Tinto to assist CA in wage negotiations.
It would be a mistake, however, to think that elite entrepreneurs whose approach is ruthless in their dealings with cricket players do not love this sport.
Peever was, for example, a regular visitor to Storm’s home games until he moved to another state.
Nevertheless, tough negotiations between CA and ACA and extremely high wages have given the impression that Australia’s summer favorite pastime is now more of a business than a sport.
On the contrary, the ARU's incompetent leader, Cameron Clyne, former CEO of NAB, has been pushed too far back by the Australian Super Rugby team to its roots.
People of the Ragbi League now prefer to limp to the suburb stadium to watch the game between amateur teams while drinking beer and eating hot dogs.
The Ragbilite boasts that they have the most qualified and versatile management in Australia, but too many failures in meeting the requirements of international partners show that it is still too much sport to be a business.
Both rugby and football have management problems as stakeholders demand more power.
The chairmen of both leagues, John Grant of the ARLC and Steven Lowy FFA, have shown that their business skills have not been sufficient to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, a former Kangaroo, ran a successful IT company but was completely out of the game for 20 years.
It became a value when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent presidency.
League stakeholders, who did not trust each other, decided that no one could participate in the Commission's work, who has participated in the rugbyiga in any way in the last three years, except as a passive fan.
The pendulum, however, moved too far to the commercial side, and too many fans have been searching for a savior ever since, someone with a prominent past in sports.
Lowy, director of foreign investment in Westfield, inherited the role of chairman of the FFA from his father, Frank, one of Australia's richest people.
The A-league clubs wish to be better represented in the board-elected congress.
Their owners lose money, but believe they're as dignified as Manchester United.
Ironically, FIFA is sending out ambassadors to end the civil war on sport.
AFL has its own ties to Rio Tinto through recently retired President Mike Fitzpatrick and former AFL Commissioner Chris Lynch, the financial manager of the mining giant.
It is too proud to take on the role of national leader in promoting gender equality, indigenous and refugee activities and gay rights.
Some cynics might suggest that this is done with government subsidies.
Richard Goyder, chairman of the AFL, said when he took Fitzpatrick's place: "AFL is more than business, given how it assists all these communities."
Goyder is the soon-to-be CEO of Wesfarmers and the first chairman of AFL who has not played the game at the elite level.
Bob Every, former President of Wesfarmers, is on the board of Cricket Australia.
The permanent feature of appointing members of the board of professional sports is often the importance of independence to competence.
In the throes of recruiting business people, they have forgotten something that might be called affection and passion for sport.
Moreover, many corporate heavyweights are not used to the intensive and sometimes personal critical monitoring of the media.
Something that works in a corporate world may not transfer to the sport industry.
Flynn submitted a corrected information disclosure report showing additional payments
Michael Flynn, who served for a short time as President Trump's National Security Advisor, presented a revised report on the disclosure of federal financial information on Thursday, containing new details of Flynn's contracts regarding Trump's transition to the presidency, the business of an Iranian-American businessman and the parent company of the data science company that worked for the Trump campaign.
In a letter which sent information with corrections, Flynn noted that his original disclosure reports had been submitted in haste without the regular consultation and review provided by the White House’s lawyers and the Government’s Ethics Office.
According to the letter, Flynn did not receive part of the attention granted to others because he was no longer an employee of the White House at the time.
Flynn resigned only 24 days after taking office in the middle of a rumor that he had given Vice-President Pence misleading information about his post-election ties with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
Flynn was also criticised for the cross-border payments made to him when he was working in the private sector after he resigned from his post as Director of the Defence Intelligence Agency in 2014.
According to the information previously published to the investigators of the House of Representatives, Flynn declared that he received approximately $68 000 in fees and payments from entities related to Russia in 2015.
In addition to the income related to Russia, the information submitted on Thursday revealed that Flynn had received at least $5000 for consultant services for the Middle East nuclear power plant construction project.
Flynn’s work on the project was already made public earlier, but it was not known that he was paid for it.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to cooperate with the SCL Group - at that time the British parent company of Cambridge Analytica - a data science company employed in the Donald Trump campaign.
One of the main donors of Cambridge is the hedge fund magnate Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is an influential financial supporter of conservatives.
The Washington Post announced in February that Flynn was hired as an advisor to the SCL Group.
According to those who knew his role, Flynn’s aim was to help SCL’s American subsidiary win new public contracts with the United States.
SCL also hired one of Flynn's former colleagues from the State Intelligence Authority to lead the efforts to award public contracts.
Flynn did not receive any compensation or actual work from SCL, according to a person who was aware of its activities.
With new information, it became public that Flynn received approximately $28,000 in the course of his transition to the presidency of Trump.
The largest public revenue source is $140,000 for Flynn’s work as a consultant and consultant for NJK Holding Corp in Minneapolis, which is operated by Nasser Kazeminy, a businessman born in Iran and currently living in the United States.
The Associated Press announced on Thursday evening a NJK statement that "Flynn advised NJK Holdings on the interest in investing in the company's securities".
NJK provides funding to GreenZone Systems, a technology company whose vice-chairman is Flynn.
GreenZone i is managed by Bijan Kian, Flynn’s business partner, Flynn Intelis, a company which is currently under investigation because of its role in lobbying on behalf of a company operating in the Netherlands, linked to the Turkish Government.
Earlier on Thursday, Elijah asked E. Cummings (Md.), the lead democrat of the Committee of Representatives for Monitoring and Government Reform, to provide Kian with information on Flynn's foreign business contacts and travels.
During Flynn's earlier security check, Kian told military investigators that his partner had several foreign business contacts.
According to Cummings, Flynn said nothing to the same investigators about such contacts.
According to a person familiar with the situation, Flynn nevertheless passed a security check at that time.
In August the main performer was revived on stage, the singer was taken to Tallinn with an ambulance.
Ivan got to the end of the set when he was hit by a health problem.
An ambulance was called in and massaged his heart for several decades," says Indrek Ditmann to Elu24.
"A delay came into the program, but the festival goes on", he says, and adds, "The audience has been informed, of course they also saw everything that happened on stage."
Ivan is currently on his way to Tallinn with an ambulance and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course we hope for the best," says Ditmann in conclusion.
The eyewitness told Western life that Denisenko was hit by a health defect during the performance.
First the man stopped singing, then the music started to pass, and the man fell on his back on the stage.
A Conferansjee Jan Uusväld came to the stage and asked if there was a doctor in the audience.
A little later, he asked me to pray for Denisenko.
Ivan Denisenko / August blues
Ivan Denisenko or Ivan Blues is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural character.
Ivan's musicianship began in parallel with art studies at the Ukrainian National Academy of Art and Architecture.
At the university he was immediately fascinated by his incredibly deep bassist and invited to sing the Golden Gate of the nationwide folk choir.
He was friends with people who introduced him to the blues and later became his bandmates.
The first concert of a band called Ivan Blues & Friends took place on 31 December 2007 at a bar in Kiev called Rag-Time.
Since then, the band has been active regularly, performing in clubs, concert halls and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes book in taglog language
"A Helping Hand" is the first book by Michaels, former editor of the BBC and mother of two children. Previously he has written to Singapore Tatler.
It took three years to finish the book and it is dedicated to Maricon Espirituli and Ginalyn Narag, his Filipino assistants, who help with cooking and keeping his son, four-year-old Joseph, and his daughter, eight-year-old Florence.
The assistants he describes as "family members" helped test prescriptions while writing the book. This is the first such book in Singapore to be published in both English and Tagalog.
"A Helping Hand" is available in bookstores everywhere in Singapore at 39.90 SGD and also in migrant centres abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He thought he'd gotten the stomach virus from a colleague.
But why were his symptoms so different?
At the trauma point, he was given a high dose of acetaminophen to lower his fever.
For the rest of the day, he was kept being questioned, poked, poked, and investigated.
None of the tests showed anything, but they didn't want to send him home either.
He understood the reason.
For the past two years, she had taken a medicine called etanercept to treat Sjogren’s syndrome.
It reduces the ability of the immune system to fight infections.
Sjogren is an autoimmune disorder - a rather mysterious disease in which the body’s own white blood cells attack normal tissue, as if it were an invasive organism that, in this case, sown chaos in the glands that produce tears and saliva, as well as in some joints.
Weekly injections of etanercept had helped to reduce his joint pain.
But he knew that because of this medicine, he was quite helpless in the event of a serious infection.
When acetaminophen began to work, the patient felt much better.
The emergency room doctors decided to leave him at the hospital for the night.
If it's a virus, as the doctors suspected, he'll be fine the next day and he'll be released.
When Girard first heard of his new patient, he was familiar with infections to which the people taking etanercept are susceptible.
That list was long.
Viruses cannot be treated before diagnosis, so she focused on bacterial infections.
One bacterium that attacks immunocompromised people is a food-bornelister’s abacter.
It is often found in unpasteurised milk and cheeses, causing terrible nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea that he did not experience.
Legional disease is another infection that is common among those taking this medicine, but it had no cough or shortness of breath.
The more common bacterium Staphylococcus aureus may cause joint infections, but, again, it had no joint complaints.
Nevertheless, the doctor planned to start a comprehensive antibiotic treatment that would cover all these risks.
But when I met the patient, it didn't seem like he was suffering from a serious infection.
Doctors at the trauma point had not given him antibiotics.
The doctor had the opportunity to delay the administration of antibiotics and simply monitor and wait, but if the patient had had one of the infections he had read about, even delaying treatment by a few hours could have been fatal.
The situation was all the more complicated by the fact that the patient thought he was allergic to penicillin, although he did not remember what happened when he took it.
This created a risk-benefit shift.
The decision whether to start antibiotic treatment or not will change if its consequences can be so dangerous.
He asked a colleague, another resident, to evaluate the patient.
Girard didn't tell his colleague that he was planning an antibiotic treatment, so he just asked me to take a look at the patient and give him a recommendation.
A colleague met a patient and agreed.
Although she looked good, she would be virtually defenseless if she had an infection.
The doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
As a patient has experienced penicillin allergy, Girard should have him tested to check whether he tolerates a medicinal product that is not penicillin but a close relative.
Girard asked for a test dose.
If he had had a serious reaction to the medicine, he would have had a rash or his blood pressure would have decreased.
Neither happened.
Therefore, he was given a full dose.
A few hours later, Girard got a call.
The patient's body temperature was up to 39 degrees Fahrenheit [39 ° C].
He rushed to see the patient.
The patient's face was shiny from a thin layer of sweat and his cheeks were pink.
Although she seemed uncomfortable, her heart and blood pressure were fine.
The doctor thanked himself for giving the patient antibiotics.
He asked for another dose of Tylenol, and when he came to see the patient for the last time, he slept deeply.
The fever had receded.
Sweat glow and pink cheeks were gone.
The next night, when Girard returned to the hospital for the night shift, he first visited the patient.
He had also received five other patients, but Girard was the one who was most worried about this patient at home after he was handed over to his daily crew.
During the hours he missed her, the laboratory had developed an organism in his blood.
It was too early to tell me exactly what it was.
It was clear, however, that it was a bacterium that was strong enough to grow up quickly, and that it was not Staphylococcus aureus or legionnaire disease.
The list of other options was long and none of them actually saw fit.
It took two more days before they could finally identify the bacteria.
It was a listeria bacteria.
Girard, like everyone else who cared for the patient, was surprised.
As a doctor, you get pictures of disease in your head.
For Girard, Listeriosis was a disease derived from unpasteurised milk and soft cheeses that causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
He further examined the material for this unusual infection and found that although people with a normal immune system may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly as a patient’s colleague.
However, in pregnant women, older than 65 years of age and people with a damaged immune system, the infection may become viral outside the gastrointestinal tract - sometimes without showing normal symptoms - and enter the circulation.
From there it can spread all over the body like wildfire.
This type of infection, called invasive listeriosis, can lead to death in up to 30% of patients with this disease.
Indeed, although it is not as common as botulism, Listeriosis can be as lethal.
Early antibiotic therapy can save life.
If this is a food-borne disease, what kind of food carried this bacteria?
Although the patient and his colleague had not used unpasteurised milk or soft cheese during the trip, an online search in Scotland this summer identified an outbreak of Listeria related to smoked beef.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they ate some smoked salmon.
The place where they picked up the bacteria was a mystery.
After the doctors ’ team learned what was wrong with the patient, they were able to adjust the antibiotics.
His three-week treatment ended in July.
The doctors advised him to calm down until the end of the summer, but by now he feels quite well and has returned to the museum and his beloved work.
He was praised for obstructing a global cyber attack.
And then he was arrested.
In 2014 when the malware Kronost was first advertised in Russian underground forums, the questionable price of $7,000 indicated that selling malware was a profitable business.
Kronos was advertised as a hacking tool capable of obtaining data, including usernames and passwords, ATM PINs and personal information useful in breaking security issues.
On Thursday, Motherboard announced that Hutchins was detained at Las Vegas Airport after a week of security conferences called Black Hat and Defcon.
He was planning to fly back to his home in Britain.
The security community reacted with surprise and skepticism to the arrest of its esteemed star.
Some warned that claims against Hutchins could damage the relationship between "white" hackers - researchers looking for software weaknesses in identifying and solving problems rather than committing crimes or sowing chaos - and law enforcement authorities.
Others hesitated that Hutchins could have created such software as an attack.
In July 2014, he asked on Twitter whether anyone had an example of Kronos, which is a strange request when he himself was the author of malware.
Although the exact details of Hutchins’ involvement in Kronos’ malware are not clear, security investigators have often ignored legal problems when searching computer code for vulnerable areas.
In recent years, large technical companies have put out "fault money" to formalise the process of reporting problems to researchers and compensating for their work.
At the Defcon conference, an unrestricted gathering of security experts from all over the world, there has also been an intense relationship with law enforcement authorities.
In 2002, the FBI arrested a Russian encryption expert in a hotel room in Las Vegas, for example, after publishing software that, according to the authorities, could have compromised the security of certain types of e-books.
The Digital Frontier Foundation stated in its statement that it was concerned about the arrest of Hutchins and that it would examine the matter more closely.
WannaCry's ransom assets infected computers that worked on older versions of Microsoft Windows.
After spreading, software encrypted computers and locked users' files, folders and disks.
When the infected device was connected to the network, other devices on the network could also be infected.
The attackers insisted that the victims pay hundreds of dollars to the bitcoin address.
Hutchins became a so-called random hero.
In an interview given to the Guardian in May, Hutchins said that he registered a web domain after discovering that malicious software was trying to connect with it.
By registering a domain for $10.69, he launched a so-called kill switch that stopped the software from spreading.
His original intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who works as an investigator at the Kryptos Logic company in Los Angeles, said in an interview that he did not go to college and had learned how to write software himself.
The company did not comment.
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous, communicating with the media through his handles through MalwareTech, but the British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was praised for this achievement in the cyber security community and received special recognition at the SC Awards Europe industry event.
The senate confirmed Woody Johnson, New York Jets's owner as ambassador to Great Britain.
Johnson was Trump's biggest financial supporter during the presidential campaign and was appointed financial manager of his Inauguration Committee in November.
Long-term Republican donor Johnson also helped raise money for George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney when they were party candidates.
Date of Birth: a) Approximately 1963, b) Approximately 1963.
Johnson’s great-grandfather started a medical - wise company called Johnson & Johnson.
Matthew Barzun, the United States Ambassador to Britain, used to be.
Barzuni was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013 and resigned in January of this year before Trump was sworn in.
Belgian officials already knew about egg contamination in June
"We knew already at the beginning of June about possible problems with insect poison fipronil", said the spokesman for the Belgian Food Safety Agency in the VRT religion of Katrin Stragier TV channel.
We started an investigation immediately, and we talked to the D.A.'s office about it because it may have been a fraud.
From there, the investigation became secret.
We understand that people have health issues and we are trying to answer them", Stagier added.
The news agency AFP tried to get information from the DA in the last few days, but he didn't say anything because the investigating judge banned the release of the information.
Chicken eggs have been withdrawn from the market in Belgium as a precaution until the results of the analyses are available.
Millions of Dutch eggs have been withdrawn from sales in the Netherlands and Germany.
The German Minister of Agriculture, Christian Schmidt, has called on Dutch and Belgian officials to clarify the matter quickly.
"Someone has obviously polluted eggs with a criminally banned product," Schmidt said to the German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Board (VTA), there are probably no eggs contaminated by pesticides produced in the Netherlands in Estonia.
"There are no Dutch eggs in Estonia according to our information," said VTA spokesperson Martin Altraja to BNS.
He added that there are no other Dutch eggs products in Estonia either.
According to Statistics Estonia, no eggs have been imported from the Netherlands into Estonia in the last 10 years.
The last eggs were imported from the Netherlands to Estonia in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticide fipronil reached the henhouses as a result of the Dutch company Chickfriend’s attempt to cure the affected chickens.
Media reports from the Netherlands and Belgium that the pesticide-containing substance reached Chickfrient via a Belgian company have yet to be confirmed.
In larger quantities, fipronil is reported by the World Health Organisation to be moderately hazardous and may have a negative impact on humans, especially children, kidneys, liver and thyroid.
Is there a solution to avoiding annoying robot calls?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is often a waste of time.
His Sports City Pizza Pub in New York, Buffalo, depends on customers calling and ordering chicken wings, pizza and potato chips.
But for a large part of the time, these are automatic messages that try to push the fraud through.
"It is getting to the point that it does not allow other callers to reach us," said the 24-year-old bar owner.
Help is on the way, though slow.
Over the past year, new tools have been added to mobile phones, inspired by the government, to prevent unwanted "robot calls".
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed to enable telephone companies to block more junk calls and hopes to deter fraudsters with high fines.
According to experts, these steps are not the final solution, but they are a good start.
Federal and state non-voting lists should protect people from unwanted calls from distance distributors.
But fraudsters don't care if they break the law.
Cheaters reach people cheaply and easily, using "automatic dialers", which automatically make a lot of calls at the same time.
It is estimated that Americans receive tens of millions of robot calls a day.
Not all of them are fraudulent, of course.
Pharmacies, for example, send automated messages about compliance with prescriptions.
But all too often the situation is: you owe the IRS money; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; it offers a free cruise!
In addition, spam callers use sophisticated technology that shows a local or important - looking number, such as the Tax Administration, as a phone caller.
The implementation of appropriate measures for the numbers for "pushing" would make fraud more difficult and help consumers in the United States save millions of dollars, as stated in the FCC document by a group of state prosecutors.
Telephone companies and independent applications can screen or block unwanted calls by comparing them to known problem-number databases and analysing suspicious behaviour such as a number that calls many people on non-calling lists.
Wireless service providers also have tools that add warnings like "probably fraud" to incoming calls, but they are not available on all phones or on many prepaid card clients.
You can order them from Verizon and Sprint for an extra fee.
Some Android phones, including Google Pixel, screen junk calls for free.
Multimedia producer Jen Vargas (39) from Orlandos, Florida, said that his AT&T app would label and block certain fraudulent calls on his mobile phone, but he has abandoned his phone lines.
"I rarely take calls from numbers I don't know," said Vargas.
Applications like YouMail and Nomorobo offer free but limited relief for home phones.
In the case of YouMail, the operator must allow "conditional call forwarding", which will forward calls if no answer is received or if it is busy.
Nomorobo is not available for all home phone providers and does not work with older copper-based telephone lines.
It is also possible to buy gadgets, some of which are rather obscene, which block calls on home phones.
Verizon also tests the display of warnings about suspicious calls on home phones.
Telephone companies are already able to block certain calls that are fraudulent.
The FCC has proposed rules to formalise such practices and allow other suspected fraudulent calls to be blocked.
This means that Verizon can block a tax-free number that receives calls for a fee, but never initiates any.
Operators would also be able to block calls where they know that they are not legitimate, e.g. 911 coded numbers.
These rules still need to be refined.
Ms Mahoney, a public law student in a non-profit consumer association, said that these developments are 'hopeful' but do not protect consumers from all unwanted calls.
Firstly, non-calling lists do not apply to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
In addition, according to Mahoney, the FCC rules would cover only counterfeit numbers.
Not all robot calls are meant to be tricked.
The Consumers' Association wants telephone companies to make call blocking tools available to all consumers free of charge.
In the longer term, the FCC industry supports efforts to confirm that the caller really is who it claims to be.
Perhaps one day you will be able to see a green bird on your smartphone screen if the caller is right.
Phone company lobbyist U.S. Telecom says it may take several years to put it into use, but it would be a powerful tool against robot callers.
The FCC is also looking for ways to stop annoying calls being followed by consumers who exchange numbers.
If you register yourself now on a non-call-list but get a new number later, the distributor may not know and may start bothering the new line.
"Robot callers are not going anywhere," said Aaron Foss of Nomorobus, which is a mobile and home phone call blocking service.
"They are criminals and find a new way to bypass any system.
But our job is to make it as difficult for them as possible."
There are a number of logical measures that consumers should take.
Don't answer the phone if you don't know the number.
Yes, unfortunately, this is not practical for call lines from companies like Sports City.
Abort unwanted calls.
Do not speak back or press any buttons.
If you communicate with them, they can mark you as someone who reacts and bury you under more calls.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use call blocking apps.
If you have any privacy concerns, check the application’s rules to see if it shares your call or contact information with the distributors.
Do not provide personal information to callers, such as bank account or social security number.
Rasmus Mägi: The preparation has not gone quite as I saw in my mind
"It hasn't exactly been the way I saw it," said Mägi about the training before MM.
On Friday-Saturday, there are important moments that show exactly how the body is.
And the competition will show you what we're analyzing here anyway.
Today, I believe that my preparation has been of high quality both this year and in previous years, so that it can run normally on top of it.
Nothing special has been dealt with on Sunday, according to Estonian time 13.05 since the home championship.
In the last few weeks, training is often too much.
I'm supposed to have freshness, and it might be very helpful that the last week before M.M. was a little easier.
On the physical side, the days left to the start go like this: yesterday the barrier runner rested, today he is working out warming.
However, he does not very much want to delve into his spiritual preparation: "In time, I have developed my own routines.
There's a lot of quiet and peace, and I'm not letting rock music on my ears.
I don't need to watch any motivational videos or read self-help books, but to be here and at that moment to appreciate that athletes from all over the world have come together to compare their abilities in one place.
This, in itself, creates a speciality.
Of course, the MM is the top event of the year for every tracker, and Mägi has taken every previous launch, including competitions in the Diamond League, as an experiment - tried some technical nuances, compared himself to a competitor.
There's no way to experiment in the title contests anymore.
"The goal here is simply to run quickly", says Mägi, but he adds that if you can save even a percentage or a few of your energy in the front run and potentially in the semi-final, they will certainly be useful in the next race.
The Finns threw a dance for their men.
When the first men's dance party was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organizers probably did not dream that the northern neighbours would follow the example of a small Estonian city.
Today, however, the first Finnish men’s dance party is held in Lapua, West Finland.
"The representatives of Lapua City were so impressed by the last men's dance in Rakvere, that they wanted to organize something similar," said Kairit Pihlak, Deputy Mayor of Rakvere.
"This is how two shows of Mies-Tanssipido are taking place today at the Lapua baseball stadium in Finland in the framework of the Finnish 100 celebrations, where 100 men from Virumaa also perform," said Pihlak.
According to Pihlaku, this is an excellent example of good cooperation between the two towns of friendship.
It also celebrates the anniversary years of the Republics of Estonia and Finland.
Among the hundreds of dancers are Karl Reinbubjas, winner of the 69th annual season.
"I am honored to be one of the 100 men who, by their participation in Finland, show what Viru's men are capable of," he said.
"In preparation for the Finnish men's dance, Rakvere dancing men have put all their joints in order to show a decent level with their northern neighbours," said Ain Suurkaev, member of Rakvere City Government.
The performance of the men of Virumaa has been made complete by the dance ensemble Tarvanpää artistic director Tiiu Mürk together with the renowned choir leader Elo Üleoja.
The Estonian choreography is based on Estonian choir music.
The first Estonian men’s dance party was organised in 2006, but so far the last one was held in Rakvere in 2015.
In anticipation of the final of the night's drive emissions: will Gerd Kanter make the history of the MM?
The current MM is the eighth for Kanter, and none of his competitors in London have achieved such an achievement.
In addition, Kanter is the only disc-thrower in history who has won a full set of medals (gold, two silver and two bronzes) from MM.
As of today (5 August 2017), Kanter is 38 years and 92 days old.
If Estonians cast themselves into a double world champion, they will be the oldest disc-thrower to win the gold medal on MMil.
Pjotr Malachowski (34 years and 60 days old) has a similar opportunity.
More exciting facts:
More than once, only two national athletes have become world champions of disks.
There are nine gold medals in Germany, two in Lithuania.
The World Championship record belongs to the name Virgilijus Alekna, which is cast 70.17 in Helsinki (2005).
The lowest result won by the title is 66.20 - done by Riedel (1991).
The results of the investigation show that cockroaches also distribute seeds
Like birds and mammals, cockroaches spread seeds.
These insects are mainly known as decomposers who help to dismember decaying substances under the forest.
The cockroaches, however, also help to spread seeds.
Japanese scientists discovered that cockroaches play an important role in spreading seeds of the forest species Monotropastrum humile.
It's an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophyll, so it is not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species receives its nutrients from fungi growing beneath the ground.
The plant spreads small, odourless, pale white fruits on the forest floor.
The fruit has very little or no taste, and Japanese researchers found that bird and mammal species are not interested in it as a source of food.
Only a handful of invertebrates consumed pulp, and the forest cockroach Blattella nipponica was the only species that regularly visited the crops.
Researchers checked the roaches ’ stools to determine whether these insects helped to spread the seeds of the plant.
Scientists found that each fecal swab released after eating fruit contained an average of three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the seed digested was viable.
Scientists assume that this unique plant species is likely to have learned to exploit the ability of evolution to spread cockroach seeds.
The fruit of the plant hangs near the ground and is produced at the same time as the cockroaches leave their larval stages.
Researchers published their findings this week in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.
"While around 4600 cockroach species have been identified so far, seed distribution through cockroaches may be a much broader and still simply undocumented mechanism, not just the unique ability of a particular plant species to exploit cockroaches," said Naoto Sugiura, co-professor at Kumamoto University.
"It is hoped that published findings will encourage people to pay more attention to the relationship between plants and cockroaches and to seek further examples of how cockroaches spread seeds."
A childhood friend of the Duchess of Cambridge should have "right to die"
According to his mother, a childhood friend suffering from the deadly disease of the Duchess of Cambridge should have been allowed to end his life.
Isobel Kennerley, a member of the duchess' guide group, begged her to die after three years of fighting a brain tumor that caused her "extreme pain, suffering and loss of dignity."
A 34-year-old woman with cerebral paralysis of children was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2014, but she suffered terribly, according to her mother, before she finally died in May.
Christine Eey, 65, from Newbury Berks, has called for a change in the law that would allow people with a terminal illness and mentally competent people to "check the way and timing" of their death.
He said that the painful death of his daughter caused him a "serious trauma" and wished that the law had allowed him to put in place a plan that would have allowed his daughter to die with dignity when her condition deteriorated.
Chinese Internet Censors Play a complex cat and mouse game
According to experts, the shift, which can affect a large number of users, from researchers to businesses, suggests that China is increasingly concerned about the influence of the Internet.
"It seems that restrictions are becoming more intense, but at the same time the internet is more powerful than ever," said Emily Parker, who has written the book "Now I Know Who My Comrades Are", which deals with Internet influence in China, Cuba and Russia.
The restrictions imposed on the Beijing Internet are proportional to the influence of the Internet in China.
According to experts, Chinese control has not yet been maximised and in many cases the game of cat and mouse continues.
One day after Apple's visit last week, people began to spread in Chinese social media a way of getting access to these tools, which are so simple that even a tech alien can do it.
This included the registration of a shop for human applications in another country where VPN applications are still available.
Nevertheless, a four-day test shows that China wants to change the game in favour of the cat.
Several Chinese online service providers said on Thursday on their social media accounts, websites or e-mails that Chinese security officials are testing a new way of finding internet addresses for those services that host or use illegal content.
Once they are found, the authorities will ask these companies to require Internet service providers to stop their customers from doing so.
If customers continue, service providers and Chinese officials will cancel their connection with the minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not reply to the faxed request for comments.
Studies indicate that tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people in China use VPNs and other types of software to bypass the Great Firewall.
Although many people are excluded from the blockages of foreign television programmes and pornography, they pose only minor challenges to China’s vast internet users’ community.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has been responsible for the new control elements of the Internet over the years, but he has also highlighted technology and the Internet as critical factors for China's future economic development.
As cyberspace has begun to play a more central role in the whole of China, the control elements of the government have evolved.
It is difficult to identify the scope of new efforts, as many users and companies do not discuss them publicly, fearing that the Chinese government will be discredited.
However, some frequent users have said that it is becoming increasingly difficult to circumvent restrictions.
One student studying in the United States and returning to China for summer vacation said that his local VPN was blocked.
According to himself, he took this period as a kind of meditation away from social media, and he left a message on Facebook for his friends to explain why he felt like he had gone underground.
A PhD student from one Chinese university said that without Google, research has become more difficult, although the university has found alternative publications so that students do not always need the Internet.
According to himself, he has now found a new way to bypass the Great Firewall without revealing what he is dealing with.
According to Chinese Internet observers, some VPNs are still working and China could do much more to intensify its restrictions.
"We believe that if the government had decided to do so, it would have stopped the use of VPN much more by now," said VPNDada, a representative of the website established in 2015 to help Chinese users find working VPNs.
"If the government had sent out more cats, it would be much more difficult for mice," said a representative who refused to name himself because of the delicateness of the group's work in China.
"They probably didn't do it because they have to leave some room for people or businesses."
China's online restrictions are often cyclical.
The current atmosphere is partly due to the upcoming important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, which is the 19th Congress of the Party in the autumn.
Five years ago, the VPNs were hit by unforeseen interruptions at that time before a similar meeting.
Like economic policy or foreign affairs, censorship in China is part of a complex and often incomplete political process.
According to analysts, the government ministries feel pressured to show that they are effective and able to intervene in the event of a problem.
"Therefore, this is certainly not the apocalypse of VPNs," said Paul Triolo, head of the Global Technology Department of the Eurazia Group.
"A more complex environment for users to navigate and new opportunities and approaches simply allow China to switch certain parts of the use of the VPN off at the time and place chosen by Beijing," he said.
The Chinese population learns to cope with these difficulties at an earlier age.
Earlier this summer, Chinese Internet Giant Tencent began to limit the time during which under 18 are allowed to play the popular online game "Honor of Kings", allowing it to do an hour a day for those younger than 12, and two hours for those aged between 12 and 18.
That is why young people in China have started using the ancient solution - fake documents.
"Does your Honor of Kings limit play time?
Are you interested in obtaining a document that shows that you are older than 18?" asked recent advertising on Chinese social media.
"No problem.
Contact us to get the document cheaply."
Estonian heavy-duty horses will be appreciated tomorrow at the Museum of Agriculture
This Saturday, August 5th, will be the Estonian Heavy Horses Day at the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The Estonian heavy-duty horse is one of three Estonian horse breeds next to the Estonian horse and tori horse.
The day of heavy-duty horses will take place for the 23rd time this year and a total of 17 heavy-duty horses from all over Estonia will arrive at the event of the year of working horses.
On that day young Estonian heavy-duty horses, stallions and mares are compared and appreciated.
In addition, the work done by the best breeders is recognised.
The total number of Estonian heavy-duty horses as a endangered breed is over 350.
Breed storage and use of horses are also introduced in Allurme.
On the same day it is possible to visit the exhibitions of the Estonian Museum of Agriculture, get to know the EV100 grainbed and rye field and participate in thematic workshops.
Visitors of all ages will find activity.
There are exciting games for children, the opportunity is to ride a pony or horse, take part in a drawing competition and visit the Science Theatre of the Three Piggy.
There will also be a summer fair offering Estonian food and crafts.
The Estonian heavy-duty horse day is organised jointly with the Estonian horse breeders’ association, the Estonian heavy-duty horse breeder’s association and the Estonian Museum of Agriculture.
Breeders are supported by the Estonian Breeding Association.
The cancer nurse's cat, Genie, was named Cat of the Year.
The rescued cat, who supported its owner during bone cancer treatment, was named the country’s cat of the year.
Genie was accepted because she comforted her owner, Evie Henderson (11), from Lincoln, for six chemotherapy sessions.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016 and Genie's company helped her to cope with a number of painful operations and long spent time in the hospital.
The cat was recognized by Cats Protection at a ceremony in London.
Photo caption: Evie said the cat was there for him when he lost his long brown hair due to chemotherapy.
"I think he's the best.
He deserves it.
He's always been there for me," said Evie.
"He came to my leg in my cast and sat next to my feet.
He sniffed the cast and then he jumped on the couch to pat on my knee with his paws.
If I was too sick to have friends come to visit or to go out, and had to sit at home, he came to me, and it made me much happier, providing great comfort."
Evie said that she had a special bond with her pet, which was a tremendous support for her when she lost her hair because of her debilitating treatment.
"It really upset me because I had long brown hair.
But since it was spring, Genie was doing the same thing, and the fact that I lost my hair and Genie's lost my own, it eased the shock a little."
Evie's father, Chris Henderson, said that the cat has been a "great distraction" and described how Evie used to watch her favorite videos in a hospital bed.
"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it offered her something to look forward to when she got home for a few precious days."
11-year-olds said, "I missed him every day when I was in the hospital, and my family said he missed me too.
He's my best friend, and I really don't know what I'd do without him."
Report: Mueller called a grand jury in a Russian investigation
The Wall Street Journal announced on Thursday that a special prosecutor investigating possible links between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign had convened a grand jury.
The page states that the jury is a new and significant step forward in the investigation of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller regarding whether Trump or his main advisors conspired with Moscow to promote the 2016 Republican Presidential Campaign.
NBC News has previously announced that before Mueller, the former director of the FBI, who is now in charge of this critical investigation, the public prosecutors had used the jury as part of the investigation of former national security advisor Michael Flynn and former campaign manager of Trump Paul Manafort.
One of the president's private lawyers, John Dowd, told NBC News he wasn't aware that Mueller had begun using the jury.
"We have been working with Bob Mueller and his team since June 1 because we want to get this thing over with," he said.
"In the light of the news of the federal grand jury, we have no reason to believe that President Trump is under investigation."
NBC News has not independently confirmed the data of the Journal.
The use of the jury is a common part of a complex investigation and is not only a tool aimed at listening to certificates, but also at obtaining information and data from individuals or businesses.
It is a powerful tool that prosecutors can use to pursue accusations and subpoenas, and it may indicate that Mueller's work is far from done.
He has denied that he or any member of his team had a plan with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also denied playing a role in Trump's surprising victory last November.
President Ty Cobb said he was unaware that Mr Mueller had begun using the new jury.
"The contents of the panel are usually secret," said Cobb in his statement.
The White House is in favour of anything that will speed up the just completion of his work.
The White House is fully committed to working with Mueller.
Jim Comey, former director of the FBI, has said three times that the President is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed."
"Flying American" under a black sail
Of course I've heard of "flying" ships.
Who wouldn't be?
The gliders travel between Tallinn and Helsinki several times a day.
It's nothing special.
The Swiss company Supramar brought the first "foily" boat, Freccia d'Oro or Golden Arrow to the market in 1952.
The technology was there before, but right now I'm facing a wind-moving base.
Catamaran, yes, but a sailboat.
What formula is it supposed to take off?
However, let us save ourselves from the formula (it is not difficult to find) and take a simple look at the concept of "foiling".
Why do planes stay in the air?
The shape of the wing is such that when the plane continues at high speed, air flowing under and over the wing creates aerodynamic lifting forces due to the difference in pressure, at one point it exceeds the plane's mass and liftes the whole machine up.
In essence, the same process takes place in water.
The right-shaped wing creates lift power as it moves forward at high speed, and this, in turn, lifts the "wing" base out of the water.
It's easy, isn't it?
It gets complicated when you get to the numbers.
The plane needs an hourly speed of a minimum of 150-250 km to take off. The world record of the sailboat speed is now "just" 121.1 km/h.
But let us not get stuck in high school physics!
Today I've come to see a flying catamaran called NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
NACRA meets as North American Catamaran Racing Association First Stars.
FCS is short for Flight Control System.
It is a system that allows the crew to set the base in the middle of the "fly", and 20 shows the length of the sailboat in the legs.
As soon as the catamaran is freed from cover, it is clear that this is not a gentleman's Sunday sailboat.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sametvest were docked today.
The beep and the glasses couldn't fit.
This right here is hardcore.
It's velocity in the cube.
"It's carbon fiber?" I ask by pointing at the sail.
Yeah, it's all carbon fibre.
"All the sail then?" I don't really understand.
"No, the whole boat," sounds like a close answer.
170 kilos -- the three of us who board will certainly weigh more than 170 kilos.
I'm comparing everything from laundry soap to evening cars, and I can't get around it here - NACRA F20 is like a pole gun that's not suitable for street driving.
Damn Zonda R or Ferrari FXX.
Built with one specific purpose - to drive well and very quickly under controlled conditions.
The amateur sailer would also be surprised by the amount of security equipment that needs to be worn before going to sea.
Waterproof suit, swing socks, special grips, sail gloves, harness, special life jacket, helmet.
In combat equipment, you get the feeling that an oxygen tank might add and as good as a sea could go colonizing Mars.
"Is there a good chance of going around?" I ask in a funny tone.
"Yes," sounds like a short answer.
"You've been around a lot?" I'm still probing the surface.
It's not gonna be a joke.
I'm putting on a seat belt.
The focus is also on the fact that the FCS of Nacra F20 needs an auxiliary boat and a minimum of two crew members to get to sea.
A maximum of three, so there's not much room for play.
It's starting to dawn, why it's not a Sunday cruiser.
Leili Forest Stories " Blog Archive " Lands and Roads Repairs
Once I’ve had a job, I can’t help but notice all kinds of land improvement, whether in the forest or in the field.
The machines and the quality of the works have improved considerably and everything is happening more effectively than in its own time.
Currently, the main thing is reconstruction, searching for mistakes and blockages, and repairing land improvement sites.
More stringent environmental requirements have been added, which were not addressed decades ago.
Building materials have been renewed, for example, plastic tubes are now used instead of the previous reinforced concrete pipes for the construction of fidelies, and fabric, the so-called geotextile, in addition to stones, is used to secure ditch slopes.
In the past, estuaries and fidelity were secured with painted concrete plates (MP, VKP) and wreaths.
In order to protect the environment, sediment ponds are dug before drainage waters (underground drains, ditches) reach natural streams or rivers to collecter ditches, which should cleanse the water from possible remains of agricultural fertilisers and toxins.
The bottom of new sediment pools or ponds is often planted with wolf’s clubs or they grow from seeds flying there themselves.
Wolves have the ability to filter toxic substances out of the water.
The pond on the picture was dug last year and this week the top of the pond was smoothed flat, a well of concrete rings was built to collect fire water.
And to keep some machines from crashing into the pond, they must have hauled big rock bumps to the side of the square.
In addition to cleaning the agricultural ditches, the forest roads are also being repaired.
The section of the road between forests on the picture should be part of the rural municipality road, which also receives an additional gravel cover.
On the right there is a state forest, the road to be reconstructed will immediately continue to the right of the dump and it will soon be completed.
There's a private forest on the left.
The open road is progressing, and there is an ongoing upgrading of the agricultural ditches and roads and an improvement in the revealed drainage errors.
