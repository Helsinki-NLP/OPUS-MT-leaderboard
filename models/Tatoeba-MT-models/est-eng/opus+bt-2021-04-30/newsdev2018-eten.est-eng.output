Two influential women share the secrets of their success
What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?
At first glance, these women come from two completely different worlds.
New York real estate magnate Barbara Corcoran was able to convert a $1,000 loan into a five billion-worth real estate company before applying her expertise on television, participating in the panel of investors for the ABC reality series Shark Tank.
Laila Ali has followed in her father's footsteps, becoming the most successful female boxer as a four-time undefeated champion before the roles of TV host, author and speaker were added to her resume.
Despite their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx recruited both women to help them talk to a hall full of hopeful entrepreneurs about breaking stereotypes and achieving high-flying goals.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in shops across the country and discovered that 80 percent of them feel that society has set them stereotypically certain roles and expectations.
Consequently, they came up with a project called The Maxx You Project to help women break down these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know a lot about it, and they may be at the top of their field by now, but it wasn't easy for either of them.
Corcoran received mainly D's in high school and college and had already worked 20 jobs at the age of 23.
Ali entered one of the most man - centered areas, and in addition, in his path faced a trial of trying to step out of the shadow of his father, who was an icon of the world.
The two, to put it mildly, are struggling with the knowledge they have acquired.
Therefore, we sat down with these influential women to talk about overcoming failures, coping with success, and trusting our gut in business and relationships.
What inspires you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I am inspired every day by my personal goals.
I have shaped the habit of writing down the things I wish to achieve.
And I'm looking at that list.
I hold myself responsible.
Of course, I'm inspired by my children.
My ambitions inspire me.
I wish to be victorious in everything I do in life.
I understand it takes a lot of work to achieve my goals, but I'm ready to do it.
My confidence comes from preparation.
So I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Laila, the key to my self-confidence is too much preparation, but I do not draw my inspiration from it.
Actually, I'm inspired by real curiosity.
What happens if I do?
What's it gonna be if I don't?
This curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning because I can't wait to see what the day brings with me.
If I don't feel that way some day, I'll just pretend to feel that way.
Then I'll believe in myself, and I'll be inspired again.
Talk about a few obstacles to your career that made you feel much better in the long run.
Barbara Corcoran: The hardest thing for me was when my business partner's boyfriend dumped me and married my secretary.
I quit business a year later, but this year of my life - being the fifth wheel - was terrible because I didn't have enough confidence to leave.
I felt defeated, lacking any inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
The hardest thing to believe in is the moments when you're hit by setbacks.
The year it took to get on your feet and start business again from scratch - this time without a partner - was extremely difficult.
Laila Ali: I'd say the hardest time of my career was when I was doing boxing, I was at the top of my career, and I decided to file for divorce.
I not only divorced my husband, but also the manager and the person who taught me everything I know about boxing.
I didn't think I could do it without him.
So I began to worry about the future of my career and had to find time to take a step back and tell myself, "You have all the knowledge and experience you need.
You have all that experience in the ring.
You can do it without a doubt."
So I formed a new team around me and continued my career.
In fact, it was simply necessary to attain the right state of mind, since everything else was driven from there.
I did what had to be done, I had to face fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and manager and continue my career.
When did you feel that you were really successful?
Laila Ali: I felt like I had achieved success when I won my first championship title.
It was a really good feeling, because when I started boxing, I wanted to be one of the best, to be invincible.
I was able to achieve this goal, and I won the championship title not once, but four times.
Barbara Corcoran: One moment when I felt I had made progress was in my eleventh year of acting.
I had finally made a profit.
I had made a profit of about $42,000 that I didn't expect.
I went out right away and bought a new car for Mom and Dad, and they never had a new car, and I had the cars delivered to Florida where they were retiring.
I felt like the Queen of England.
I felt so cool.
I earned much more than this in the years to come, but nothing has been able to offer the same feeling as the opportunity to give back something to my parents and shock them with surprise.
How did you manage to keep yourself motivated over this 11-year period in order to continue working?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit because it wasn't my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could get.
I've already set myself up on the first day to become a New York real estate queen.
And I saw myself like a pope -- everyone kisses my ring and adores me.
I had this little idea in my head.
So when I kept trying every day, every hour, I wasn't really thinking about making money.
I finally made some money by mistake.
But all the money that came in, I put it right back into business.
I don't even think I had any daunting days where I would have thought, "Oh, God, we're not making any money.
I was just convinced that something was going to work.
The worst thing that could have happened was losing the company and becoming a waitress again.
I made a good tip and was happy.
I could be happy again.
Therefore, I do not believe that money is the great ambition of many successful people.
They have other motives that spur them.
And the money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice for someone with such great dreams but who is held back by a financial factor?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have time.
I started a business.
And that's why I found myself five different partners who weren't even specialists in the brokerage business, but in different neighborhoods all over the city who knew their streets through and through.
I approached them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you the money and you'll be my partner."
The lesson here is, if you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have a talent, you can sell it to someone with money and make money with it.
There are two aspects: talent and money.
But if you don't have both together, nothing really big happens.
Ultimately, I - and also my partners - have been doing very well in all these years together with those great investors that I would never have had if I had not had the courage to find combative people who like to engage.
You can always raise money if you believe that you have talent and know your part of the world better than anyone else.
What are the two or three things you do every morning that help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don't know about you guys, but I have a lot of moments in my life when I feel overwhelmed being a mother, a businesswoman, a husband... all those roles we play as women.
I reached a point in my life where I really had to put in place the morning routine.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Gratitude for the resurrection, for your health, for your children, for your family.
I often write down at night what my goals are for the next day, and when I wake up, I'll look at that list again.
I'm meditating.
Sometimes I write in a diary.
I always drink a cup of coffee.
And I always work out first thing in the morning, because if I don't, it's never gonna happen.
For me, it is ultimately a matter of priorities.
These are things that are important to me: my spirituality, my focus on the universe and God, then training, and putting my health first.
Because of that, everything else seems simple.
I feel that I can conquer all the challenges that get in my way during the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I put things in order of importance.
I'm working through my list of tasks, which is endless and ridiculous.
And I'll set up what's most important.
What are the real priorities?
I'm just trying to live with these most important things.
What are you doing to get yourself into the right state of mind for the big meeting?
Barbara Corcoran: Imagine myself failing.
Weird as it is.
I mean, God, I'm failing.
I scare myself, and it makes me try harder.
I can imagine anyone who competes with me - I am very combative by nature because I am one of ten children and we never got enough of our parents' attention.
I can be very competitive.
And I always show up too thoroughly prepared.
Too much preparation strengthens my confidence.
Laila Ali: Amazing how opposing we are in this part.
We are two successful people and it shows how differently things work for different people.
I like to imagine that I'm successful.
I like to think about the end, which is success.
I can imagine it, I can actually see it happening.
I see entering the ring, the fight taking place, myself winning the belt and returning to the dressing room, celebrating the victory with a piece of cake as I've always done.
The same applies to meetings.
However, I always prepare myself thoroughly. This self-confidence is precisely due to the preparation, because there is a fear in the back of my head that I am not doing well or saying the right things or not having the necessary information.
This is where I'm getting ready for the game.
But I always enter by visualizing the end result.
You've both been very successful in your careers.
How do you pass it on?
Laila Ali: I'm really excited to be part of the T.J. Maxx Project Maxx You Project because I feel like it's an opportunity to do good.
A great many women need to be inspired, encouraged to pursue their dreams and goals.
There's a champion in all of us.
It's actually about mindset and having the tools you need, surrounding yourself with the right people, people who have been able to accomplish the things you're trying to accomplish.
Barbara Corcoran: One thing I think I'm doing very well is inspiring people.
That's why I was very excited when I was asked to work with the Maxx You Project.
I try to light the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward.
Many people begin to realize their dreams, but they tend to get lost at a certain point in the way.
So we try to help them focus on the goal.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even such a simple thing as elevator call, everything you need to set up a company.
What advice would you give to women who wish to make progress in men-centred areas?
Laila Ali: I'm working on one of the most men-centred areas, which is boxing.
Coming after your father, who was a global icon and the best of all time, was quite daunting.
To me, the essence of the matter was actually to find the gift, the courage, the strength in itself.
The first thing I had to do was believe in myself that I could enter the ring and succeed.
At the time, no one else was involved but me and my way had any restrictions provided for except those I had set myself in my mind.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having an attitude my way - "The New York Real Estate Queen" - and crossing the finish line is enormously long.
And at this intermediate stage, which is in your career every day, you need a lot of talent.
You don't have to do real estate brokerage to need these talents.
I am sure that in the area of Laila, too, it was necessary to decide which are the right people, the right managers, when to start, when to finish, how much money you have, what you can put in, what not, how hard you are to work.
These are all subjective decisions.
I'm trying to make these efforts a little more robust so that these women really feel, "Okay, I get it.
Let me try.
Here are my three priorities."
When they leave with three main priorities to really make things happen, I go home to bed with a smile at home tonight.
What's on your nightstand right now?
Laila Ali: Too much junk.
Magazines, books, little prayer angel, my diary.
Probably a water bottle.
Barbara Corcoran: My nightstand has a little green wind-up alarm clock because I tried to break the habit of looking at the phone first thing every morning.
That's why I got it.
That was sweet.
But it never worked.
And he's still standing there.
And my phone is still on my nightstand.
What book are you reading now?
Barbara Corcoran: Eighth or Ninth Time "How to Win Friends and Influence People".
It keeps me on the right track.
I think it's still the best book written in this area, no matter what your dreams are, dreams can't be achieved without other people.
And it is possible to relate to it today just as it was in the past.
I like to count it from time to time.
It'll help me get back on track.
Laila Ali: Studying at nutrition school, which is why I read the book Wheat-Free Diet.
It's about eating cereals and how they affect our bodies.
I'm very interested in that.
What is your best advice on coping with successes and failures?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore the pessimists.
They are encountered in all sorts of different shapes.
You need to remove them from your brain vocabulary.
Stay away from the whiners.
They're draining your energy.
I feel like thieves to be whiners.
They come in the night, grab your wallet and leave.
Pessimists destroy a team in any team situation faster than you can blink because people who feel sorry for themselves want others to feel bad too.
They pull good people in a hole with them.
I am perfectly capable of avoiding all negative people within a 50 km radius of myself because my goal is to be positive and take everything from life to take and give everything I have to offer.
So why would I want to spend even a minute on people like that?
Laila Ali: You have to be consistent.
We begin many times with conviction that now we will take this path.
Let's do it, this and this.
But people don't follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they cross the last hill.
So I think we need to stay on course.
When you feel passion for something, believe in something, you have to be consistent.
And you have to do the hard work that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: It takes a lot of work to ensure consistency.
Do you know what it takes?
Finishing things.
You start something, you finish it.
Many are skilful starters, but not particularly skilful graduates.
Latvia has the largest number of non-citizens living in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja.
There are 125 344 Latvian stateless people living in Riga, 14 266 in Daugavpils and 11 909 in Liepāja.
Outside the big cities, the majority of Latvian stateless people live in Jekabpils (2347) and Valmiera (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, there were 242,560 people living in Latvia who did not have Latvian citizenship.
In 2007, 392,816 Latvian stateless people lived in Latvia.
Jürgen Ligi recently referred on Facebook: "The quote is a poor recital".
That is why I am not going to look back and try not to recall what has been done and what results have been achieved to transform human nature in history.
I'm not evaluating whether these attempts can be considered successful or failed.
I also avoid excessive references, although in the back of my head I rely on the thought of my most important teacher, Toomas Paul: all my thoughts have been borrowed from somewhere, if only to remember exactly where.
The most striking campaign in Estonia today is the transformation of the citizen of the Republic of Estonia into a perfect person.
We will not raise him as we raise a child - in good faith that he will become a man.
We raise him as the ruling class imagines it - what one person must be like to be allowed to live and speak openly in Estonia.
Censorship is perfect.
Although the local ruling class changed partly a year ago, some methods of rearing are as frightening as those of the previous ruling class, those of the now impoverished nobility - their brutality does not fall short of the previous.
They're just different.
Latvian beer is a brand drink for the fine tuning of the new era.
Compulsory for heads of state 0.5 promilli
The ruling class includes not only those politicians who get paid by the state for their work, but also those self-aware who voluntarily do politics (read: intentionally): write opinion slips using Mihkel Mut's image, scolding on Facebook, how scary people live around them in Estonia that has degenerated here, picturing, boycotting, juggling, sabotaging.
They are only willing to stay in the echo chamber (an expression of the English people who live in a room where there are only opinions suitable for them, e.g. their own Facebook friends, etc.), but this is not possible in a conflicted Estonia.
There are still some fellow travelers who think or do something that is intolerable to the echocoast people.
And there's a war of words and the wake-up cannons are thundering.
We have a lot of politicians who know exactly how much a person can drink, sleep with, how many children to breed, how to work, how to get paid, when to rest, what to eat, how to entertain, when to be sick, how to die.
Places of great importance.
If their public speeches are echoed against anything other than what they themselves said, they are furious, offended, hysterical.
The fact that in many European countries people drive a "full-headed" car, and that is permitted by law, does not waver their opinion.
Zero tolerance is the only tolerance in every area, but behind zero tolerance is not caring, it is a villain.
Class hatred and racial desire - only people like me are good enough.
Saint politicians can only open the mouth, but never the heart.
They believe that any "action" by which they improve society works and is worth a try.
Fortunately for them, we have a guard of sufficient size with the brilliant attention of cliquers, stuntmen with mental disabilities, who jump through every window without feeling pain.
That's why it seems to us that some clever peasant opens his mouth and is emotionally beaten to death in a manor barn for that, that's what makes sense.
Some of the words that will surely accompany us to the mansion are gay, refugee, woman, violence, work, and so on.
If you believe everything that selfish officials, activists and politicians (there are only a small proportion of all groups like that, but they are able to yell so that the whole society is deafening) speak and write, the citizen is not only disgusted, vulgar and unpleasant, but also mindless, without a brain.
But let us not believe, let us not make you tolerate, let us not forbid drinking.
In any case, an Estonian person drinks as much as he wants, not as much as the state allows.
In any case, an Estonian person tolerates more than he is forced to tolerate.
An Estonian person will not change his behaviour two months before the election to turn his back on his popularity diet after the goal is achieved and again not only in his mouth, but also to exorcise what quickly restores unpleasant brain fat pounds.
He who does otherwise is not the right Estonian.
I don't think any people can be rearranged.
I believe it's possible to teach a person.
Drink sensibly, to love your family, to be a hardworking, polite, attractive companion not only to friends, but to society as a whole.
To teach, you don't have to fine, limit, forbid, force, call order, corner, throw rotten eggs at a media office.
The teacher must set an example.
A smoking politician talking about the dangers of tobacco?
A speeding cop in his spare time gives me a speeding ticket?
And then he gets caught with his head...
I have this devious idea that maybe we should try to rearrange the ruling class once and for all.
Tell them not to drink in secret.
If you drink, drink in public: in Town Hall Square, under the eyes of all the people.
Make the speed exceed only in public - the rulers' cars, including private cars, be all red.
If you rule, rule as you would yourself.
Perhaps then shame is enough if words and deeds do not come together.
Or we may find out that we ourselves want to be ruled by the most hardened.
Because all of us Estonians are what we don't want to be at all.
Where to run from yourself?
The leak of Trump's transcripts is likely a federal crime, according to former prosecutors
He who leaked transcripts of phone calls between President Trump and foreign leaders to the press likely committed the crime, was alleged on Thursday by former prosecutors when lawmakers called for the defendant to be found out.
"The unauthorized disclosure of these documents to the press is a crime," former Columbia District Attorney Joe diGenova told Fox News.
These different acts, which involve the disclosure of the notes of conversations between the president and foreign leaders and their transcripts, are a serious threat to national security.
On Thursday, based on leaked documents, The Washington Post announced new details of Trump's intense talks in late January with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
In the first, Trump ordered the Mexican head of state to allegedly stop public declaring that his government would not pay for the border wall.
According to the newspaper, the transcripts contained notes suggesting that they had been classified by the Chief of the National Security Council.
The Post said they were reached by comprehensive transcripts that had been "put together by White House staff" and were based on records from White House Notemakers.
"There is a federal provision of law that makes such a leak of classified information to an unauthorized person a crime, a federal crime," said former New York State Attorney Doug Burns in a telephone interview.
Although some of the details of these calls came to the public's attention as early as February, the disclosure of the transcript notes a far greater blow to the White House, who is trying to reduce the leaks.
The report was casually released at a time when Trump's administration's leading figures were preparing to face the public force on Friday to demonstrate their commitment to eliminating leakers of classified information.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, Deputy Attorney General General Rod Rosenstein, and Head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center William Evanina are expected to inform the public at the Department of Justice headquarters.
It is not clear whether the Department of Justice is investigating the leak in The Post.
In order for anyone to be held accountable for this, Burns said "firm elements must be clearly proved".
He said that there could be "troubles on this subject", referring to an investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails and the decision not to press charges.
These considerations include the document's markings and history and its exact classification.
In the event of secrecy, prosecutors will investigate whether the document was leaked to an unauthorized person in a manner that negatively affects the interests of the United States.
"If all this can be proved, people can undoubtedly be in a criminally vulnerable situation," Burns said.
"No doubt about it."
When talking about the transcripts of Trump's phone calls, diGenova, who was the prosecutor of espionage cases, said that such documents were "usually classified as a secret and above".
Claiming that these leaks threaten the United States government's ability to conduct foreign policy, diGenova appealed to the Attorney General for a request to convene a federal criminal grand jury to find the leakers.
He also said that in order to obtain records of telephone calls from reporters and editors of The Washington Post, a court order should be filed - something that reporters would no doubt protest against.
Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee said on Thursday on Capitol Hill that criminal proceedings should take place for leaking classified information.
"There is to be found the person who leaked them - he must be punished and additionally be fired," Lee told Fox News in a broadcast of 'America's News HQ'.
"This is unacceptable and such a thing should never happen."
Lee, who worked as a lawyer before being elected to the Senate in 2010, said that such a leak was a "crime, a very serious federal offense".
"This act should and should not be accompanied only by dismissal, but also by criminal proceedings, given that classified information is involved," he said.
Fox News was told that at this stage, the Department of Justice's Friday announcement might rather give an overview of what the Department of Justice hopes to achieve, rather than explain certain procedures.
Last week, the President criticized Sessions and publicly poured out his anger on the Attorney General, claiming that the latter had not made enough effort to find the leakers.
"I want the Attorney General to be much tougher on the leaks coming from security agencies," Trump said in the Rose Garden on July 25.
Sessions itself admitted last week to Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he was not satisfied with the leaks that have repeatedly erected obstacles for the president since his inauguration, the efforts made to investigate.
"I have not been satisfied with previous proceedings and investigations of criminal leaks," Sessions said.
Even some people who are critical of the President have spoken out against the leaks, saying that such a course is detrimental to foreign policy aspirations.
"The leaking of a transcript of a speech between the president and a foreign leader is outrageous, shocking and dangerous," David Frum wrote in Atlantic on Thursday.
"It is extremely important for the President to be able to communicate confidentially - and perhaps even more importantly, for foreign leaders to understand that they can respond confidentially."
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), the lead Democrat of the Senate Security Committee, also told The Daily Beast that the leak was "absolutely" alarming and that Congress should investigate it.
10 vile advertising tricks to make food more attractive
Since many foods are difficult to photograph, the picture uses a different ingredient that deceives people - for example, mashed potatoes instead of glue or ice cream instead of milk.
Youtube's channel Top Trending makes an overview of what tricks are quite common in the advertising world.
When someone opens a package of popcorn in a commercial or takes a hamburger out of a box, a lot of nice steam comes out of it.
In reality, the shoot is longer and hot food does not steam throughout this period because steam comes from a high water content, which, for example, bread products do not have.
Therefore, cotton balls are soaked in water in packaging or food that have the ability to absorb and store a lot of water.
In the immediate vicinity of the heat, they steam much longer than a burger or popcorn, and the product gets a freshly prepared appearance.
Potato pulp is a great helper to photographers because it does not begin to melt in light or heat and does not significantly change consistency like many other foods.
For example, instead of filling the cake with creamy fillings or ice cream that looks like ice cream, it may be mashed potatoes.
Some color and decorative elements, and the consumer has been deceived again.
The glue replaces the milk.
Milk is also not easy to photograph, as it may not look so white in the photograph.
Also, foods served with milk quickly become slime within it.
For example, since breakfast flakes or muesli have to look crispy and delicious inside the milk, glue is used instead of milk, which no cereal sinks through.
If restaurants can work hard to make meat so that the result is juicy and ripe enough, it is not advertised.
Yet, the meat presented in the advertisement looks particularly appealing, as if it came directly from the grill.
Often, however, it is fried on a prepared pan or made in an oven and pulled on the meat with stripes emulating grilling on top of shoe wax.
Working with whipped cream is as difficult as working with ice cream because it tends to melt.
Fortunately, there is a product that is almost identical in appearance to whipped cream - shaving foam.
So it could be in a commercial on a cake or berries or inside a milkshake.
Even on the surface of fruits sold in shops, there may be a thin layer of wax that makes them more shiny in appearance.
However, this is not enough for the photograph, and it is sprayed with deodorant to add gloss to the fruit.
The sauces are also not very photogenic, for in time they become more liquid or release water, for example.
However, wax comes to the rescue here, with bright colors and a more permanent texture that make it possible to take an appealing picture of appetite.
Wax is also likely to have been used in pictures where melting chocolate flows on top of cake or ice cream.
If you notice an ideally cut cake in advertising, where the biscuit to fill ratio is perfect, you may have used some extra layers or pieces of cardboard.
This is because when you cut open the cake, the filling can disperse and ruin the picture.
After cutting the cake into pieces of cardboard and spraying them over with filling, it gives a visually more beautiful impression.
Cardboard and pins are also used inside the burger to set up all the ingredients to keep them in place.
That's why a burger doesn't look like a commercial on a table.
A chicken stuffed with paper.
In advertising, the oven chicken looks juicy and full, but it may not even be cooked.
To make a full impression, the chicken is stuffed with paper, sanded with the mashed potatoes mentioned before, if necessary, and then sprayed with brown.
Pancakes are especially poured in American ads with maple syrup, because this image creates a huge appetite for pancakes in people.
In fact, the cakes absorb the syrup quickly and the flowing stream of syrup quickly disappears from the photographer’s eyes.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed with a cleaning agent for the sofa fabric that prevents rapid absorption.
It often does not help, so it is the golden - brown engine oil that is poured on warm pancakes and presented as syrup.
Former soldier sentenced to prison for murder of pensioner suspected of sexual abuse
A former soldier was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man he suspected of mistreatment of a woman he knew.
Richard Cassidy (70) was convicted in June at the Glasgow Supreme Court for the murder of David Farish (75) at his home in Tweedbank, Roxburghshire in February 2016.
Judge Lord Summers called the murder "extremely brutal" as there were 14 stab wounds in the victim's body.
Defense counsel Brian McConnachie said that the killing was caused by "momentary madness", but he described the circumstances as "extraordinary".
Cassidy heard that Farish had sexually abused a woman for a long time.
His lawyer said that the man went to Farish's home and "friended" him in hopes of hearing a confession rather than a plot to kill him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy demonstrated signs of intent on the day of the attack, and cited a social work report which revealed that the accused had undergone special forces training in the military on how to infiltrate groups by befriending.
No charges had been filed against Farish.
In court, it was reported that, after the murder, Cassidy himself contacted the police and turned himself in.
McConnachie revealed that most people have "hard to understand" that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The defense attorney said, "He has never had any problems in his life before this incident.
He lived a full life until that moment of madness in February 2016."
Cassidy's health is said to be poor and has been hit by a heart attack and stroke while in custody.
According to Lord Summers, he took into account, with a minimum sentence of 17 years imprisonment, that Cassidy had no previous convictions, and what was allegedly told to him about Farish.
Scottish police described the case as "a particularly horrifying murder of a fragile elderly male in his own home".
Detective David Pinkney said, "While this punishment does not undo his cruel act, I still hope it offers David's family some sort of solution."
On Monday, the last opportunity was to propose a nice name for a rhinoceros foal born in early June.
Zookeepers now have a large box full of names to review to find the one that will be solemnly declared on the zoo's birthday, August 25.
But the sons of the minks can still be given the name until their day of independence.
From the beginning of August, the entire family of rhinos can be seen walking in the courtyards side by side.
And even though Father Kigoma occasionally runs around in the blushing areas with horned fence posts, Mother Kibibi is not disturbed, but the rhinoceros gets valuable lessons.
Although the peak of births is over, on August 1, the calf and two domestic goats saw the light of day for him.
On a warm summer day, eagles can bathe.
The Takins, the quaint-looking Goats, began the running.
Another day of Vivacolor colour took place at the zoo on Thursday.
A large number of good helpers painted the new camel house, the garden posts of the large courtyard garden garden of the female elephants, and the viewing terrace of the male elephant.
In order not to disturb the colorers, the female elephants Fien and Draay once again spent time with Carl, the male elephant.
On 9 August, on the second classic Wednesday of the zoo, Aavo Ots’ trumpet band will perform.
In memory of the zoo, you can buy mugs with rhinos and mink and other fun items.
The proceeds of the charity sale will be used to support the corresponding species conservation project.
On Tiger's Day last week, more than 1000 euros were collected at a charity sale.
It is worth knowing: how to calculate how much sugar there is in the milk product?
"According to the European Union food labelling standards, the quantity of carbohydrates and sugars can be displayed on the packaging, which is not at all equal to the quantity of white, so-called table sugar", said Krista Kalbin, marketing director of Valio Eesti.
According to him, there are in reality three types of sugar in dairy products: lactose in milk, or natural milk sugar, glucose and fructose in fruit, and added sugar, or sucrose.
However, bearing in mind a few simple basic truths, according to Kalbin, the calculation of the amount of added sugars contained in the product should not be difficult.
First of all, it must be made clear whether it is a milk product or a fermented milk product.
The normal milk and milk drinks contain about 5 grams of natural milk sugar or lactose per 100 grams of product.
In acidified dairy products, yoghurt or kefir bacteria have consumed some of the lactose in the process of acidification, resulting in an average of 3,5g/100g of lactose per product in acidified dairy products.
"In order to calculate the quantity of added sugar, the first thing to calculate is the quantity of sugar to be deducted is lactose", said Kalbin.
Now the quantity of sugars must be deducted from the fruit and fruit fructose and glucose.
"In general, fructose and glucose are flavoured in milk products with a normal 3-4% fruit content of about 0.3 grams and especially in eggs of about 15% fruit content of up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams", Kalbin said.
According to him, this simple calculation shows that the proportion of added sugar in berry yoghurts may be up to twice as low as the proportion of sugars indicated on the package.
In the case of lactose-free products, the situation is slightly different as the sugar content depends on the production technology.
Comparison of the most advantageous spa packages: from nightclub tickets to sauna rituals
The Consumer Editor of Postimees compared the more favourable packages offered by spas to one person for one night on August 11-12.
"Spa hotels have different levels and services, so it is very difficult to compare one to one based on the price only", said Mario Sau, sales manager of Spa Tours OÜ.
Compared to spa accommodation facilities, it turns out that the prices of the most affordable packages vary several times and there are choices for both the more demanding customer and the more modest holidaymakers.
For example, if a single passenger can spend 51 euros in a single room in Värska Spa with buffet evening and breakfast and unlimited use of water park, gym and saunas, then when visiting Pädaste Manor in Muhumaa with a companion, a package price of 287 euros will be charged to one person.
It includes accommodation in the Double Deluxe category room, breakfast in the Alexander Winter Garden of the restaurant, and a half-day spa package of "Coat and Moisture".
When choosing and comparing different packages, it should be taken into account that you should go on holiday with a friend or companion in order to get the cheapest price, as staying in a double room is more affordable than taking a single room.
However, if you wish to rest alone, you will be offered special one-person rooms as well as double rooms for extra costs.
While, in general, a passenger without a date will simply have to pay a premium of 20 euros for staying alone in a double room, compromises can also be found in more favourable ways.
For example, in Fra Mare Thalasso Spa in Haapsalu, the package costs 86 euros by overnight accommodation in a single room, but a more favourable option is also offered if you wish to stay in a double room on condition that, in case of lack of space, someone else is accommodated by informing the customer in advance.
In this case, the price of the package will be EUR 58.
It is worth being flexible to get the most favourable deal.
Package prices are dynamic, i.e. they depend on the day of the week and the fulfillment.
"In the case of the most favourable package, prices can vary from 112 euros to 248 euros", explained Sales and Marketing Manager of V SpaHotel in Tartu, Triinu Teras.
He also pointed out that the price in their hotels is variable, depending on the fulfillment rate, and added that the customer generally gets the most advantageous price by booking directly from their website or asking for a bid.
Since the summer period is the fastest for the spas, it is advisable to plan the holiday in good time to avoid a situation where the desired place has been sold out.
For example, only suites have been selected for comparison on 11 August in Pärnu Hedon Spa and Strand Spa and the conference hotel, and Vihula Manor in Lahemaa has also been sold out.
You don't have to look far for opportunities to spend a relaxing holiday: in almost every major Estonian city, you can find one or even several spas.
At the same time, before buying the package, it is worth exploring whether there will be any major events in the vicinity, as this will immediately raise prices to the ceiling.
For example, from 11 to 13 August, events of the White Lady will take place in Haapsalu.
At that time there are a lot of tourists in Haapsalu, there is a very high demand for accommodation and we have prices for major events at that time.
"So at this time we do not have on sale accommodation with a discount price or affordable packages", commented Irene Väli, manager of the spa hotel Wave.
The Chinese company that came to Estonia last year immediately made EUR 100 million in turnover
The Chinese-owned agricultural product seller Agritera, which started operating only last year, reached a turnover of almost 100 million euros.
Profits were nearly 2 million euros, says Äripäev.
The company’s annual report shows that Agritera OÜ’s sales revenue for the buying-in and wholesale of agricultural products amounted to 100.6 million euros in 2016.
Profits were made at €1.91 million.
A year earlier, there was no economic activity in the company.
The company employed an average of 3 people last year, with no employees in 2015.
The turnover per employee amounted to EUR 33.6 million, with an average gross remuneration of EUR 316 per month.
Jüri Kolk: Rest all year, so you don't need a vacation.
Of course, I was responsible for not taking this vacation.
I guess I was also a somewhat needed employee, but I think I was the only one who considered myself irreplaceable.
It's my fault I had a stupid sense of duty in my chest.
The quote at the beginning of this column is nice in that it is absolutely true.
That's what happened. The new job I started in March of the same year required a lot of work, but something about this job was so much better for me that I recovered to a whole new life in three months, I rested myself.
It's summer, vacation time.
It's time to make New Year's promises, see what's happened in life, and what direction this whole thing's going in.
"It's Christmas and New Year's Eve for that!" now some decent citizen exclaims.
Maybe it is, but we all know from experience that Christmas is not suitable for thinking about life and setting goals.
All right, I'm just speaking for myself. I can't make any changes on New Year's Eve.
It's too hard for me.
Of course, there is happiness and joy in the Christmas season: I like knowing the beginning of the triumph of light, I like the Christmas lights, and Jesus too was a very sympathetic, revolutionary-minded fellow.
Nevertheless, at Christmas, I am mostly very tired and sometimes stressed - already because of the darkness.
Yeah, I'm doing a lot of work living a vacation-free life, maybe more than doing in a fucking slaughterhouse, and I'm pretty rested all the time.
Mostly in the pre-Christmas era I've been running like a squirrel on a bike - gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a slightly higher load at work ...
Considering the constant social pressure to feel unconditional joy and peace in the heart, the difficulties of the Christmas season are evident.
But a desperate and tired person cannot make good decisions, much to the point of perfecting them.
Such things have to be done with a more or less clear head.
A tired person may throw into the air an empty, sounding promise that will help to lay the foundation of the future about as much as buying a lottery ticket.
A promise that is meant to change something should be thought through calmly, it should become useful, it should be a plan.
The plan, unlike the promise, includes not only a goal but also a guide of action and does not break for a few minor setbacks.
That's why I'm saying the best time to figure out the promises is now, in the summer.
You just have to rest calmly and wonder why it's as tired as it is.
If you don't have to fight like a calf that got out of the barn on vacation, then a couple of weeks will be enough to find a hook in your life that deserves to be straightened out and figure out exactly how it will be done.
I consider it important to live as much as possible so that I do not need a holiday to rest on a regular basis, not once a year.
So the holiday would be an extra pleasure, not a pit stop for survival, during which one is loaded so much that one can somehow endure the next year.
I recommend at least one simple summer promise to everyone - if you have to get up at a certain time the next morning, get up early at night.
I believe that if one in ten readers of Postimees listened to my recommendation, life in Estonia would be considerably better.
I myself intend to follow my own advice.
We've already got Thursday week, but not what we're expecting.

Many Estonians already have a four-day working week that they do not know they want.
But not as they would expect, says Business Day.
It was created by modern workspace planning, or open office.
According to the prestigious management magazine Harvard Business Review, an employee spends nearly 1.5 hours a day in a wallless office, almost a whole day a week empty.
However, if the four-day working week refers to four working days and three working days, this forced solution is worse than this.
One and a half hours have been taken from working time, instead of family and hobbies or holiday recovery, it has been furnished with concentration difficulties, work interruptions, growing irritation and anxiety, and job losses.
Weekend's third day of festival is accompanied by strong winds.
Thus, a seagull in distress caught the wind and tried to fly in front of the camera of the evening newspaper’s picturer.
Due to windy weather, many festival visitors also admit that the mouth and eyes are full of sand.
How a man built a 51 million dollar theme park for his daughter
A father living in Texas discovered that there are no theme parks where his disabled daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman had just come out of the pool on family leave when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan approached other children playing in the water.
He tried to befriend them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they got scared because they don't know how to treat a disabled person - Morgan has a five-year cognitive understanding and also a certain form of autism.
He was haunted by the incident.
"Morgan is a lovely young girl.
Meeting him always brings a smile to his mouth, and he no doubt wishes to hug.
But there have been many times where we haven't been able to take him to different places," he says.
Hartman and her husband Maggie asked other parents where they could take their daughter - somewhere where she would feel comfortable and others would feel good communicating with her as well.
"We came to the conclusion that there is no such inclusive place," Hartman says.
Thus, in 2007 he decided to build it himself.
A former real estate developer sold his home construction companies in 2005 to establish The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation - a non-profit association that helps disabled people.
He then began the creation of "the world's first highly accessible theme park".
"We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do anything where people with and without special needs can play," says Hartman.
He called together doctors, therapists, parents, and other disabled and disabled people to consult on the facility.
They were erected in a 10-hectare abandoned career in San Antonio, Texas.
A park called Morgan's Wonderland cost $34 million (£26 million) and opened in 2010.
The attractions include a fully accessible Ferris wheel, an adventure playground and a mini-train.
Visitors often tell Hartman that they were only able to experience such attractions for the first time.
There is also a carousel with carriages specially designed for wheelchairs that move up and down alongside animals.
Hartman, however, states that Morgan was initially fearful of the ride.
"When we opened, he didn't dare go to it.
He didn't understand why it was going around and why animals were moving up and down," Hartman says.
It took three years before Morgan agreed to go to the carousel.
"At first he stood just close to it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the ride.
It was a slow process, but now he loves to drive it.
Overcoming something that scared him meant a lot to him.
The little things achieved by playing make a big difference."
Since its inauguration, Morgan's Wonderland has been visited by over one million people from 67 countries and all 50 American states.
One third of the staff is disabled and entry is free for anyone who has a medical condition.
"I realized Morgan was one of the lucky ones because he has a lot of things he needs.
I didn't want the price to be an obstacle to other people with special needs," says Hartman.
"We open up every year, knowing we're going to lose at least a million dollars (£750,000) and have to earn it back with the help of fundraisers and partners."
That year, the theme park was expanded with the opening of Morgan's Inspiration Island, or a fully accessible water park.
"In July, fewer people visited the park as wheelchairs became too hot.
So we decided to set up a water park next," Hartman says.
Warm water has been used in some parts of the island, helping visitors with muscle problems.
Waterproof motorized wheelchairs with compressed air and not batteries are available.
It is also possible to sail a boat on the river.
The water park cost a total of $17 million (£13 million).
"A man came to me yesterday on Inspiration Island and just held my hand," Hartman says.
"He pointed to his son, who has serious special needs, and began to cry.
According to him, his son had not been able to play in the water before."
According to Hartman, three of the park's four visitors are not disabled, and the park has exactly the effect it hoped for.
"It helps people understand that although we are different in certain ways, we are actually exactly the same," he says.
"I saw one girl in a wheelchair go to another girl with no special needs and they started playing together.
It was really awesome."
Hartman has no plans to open any more parks, although he has received hundreds of letters by mail and email from people who would also like to park in his neighborhood.
Instead, she focuses on providing educational facilities for adolescents with special needs in San Antonio.
"I know there are many different organizations that are trying elsewhere to build something similar to Morgan's Wonderland, and we will continue to work with them," he adds.
He continues to take Morgan to the theme park with him - Morgan is now a kind of celebrity there.
"When he comes here, he's like a rock star!
A lot of people want to talk to him and take a picture with him, he can handle it well," Hartman says.
Morgan, who's 23 now, can handle things better and better.
"He is now talking more and most of his physical problems have been resolved with numerous operations.
We are so proud that he has come so far."
When Morgan visits the park, he likes to play on swings and in the sand area the most, not knowing how much he has helped others.
"Morgan knows the park has been named after him, but I don't think he understands what it really represents and how it has changed lives," says Hartman.
"He doesn't understand that the way he's handled things in life has made him a real source of inspiration."
U18 team head coach Vaido Rego: play-off game can be decided by one or two shots
The Estonian U18 age class basketball team defeated Poland 68:63 in the quarterfinals of the home EM B division; according to head coach Vaido Rego, this was a genuine play-off match.
The game was brittle.
Both teams had done their homework, the points came hard.
There's a fact that comes into play who's got better nerves.
The play-off could be a one-to-two throw game", discussed Rego.
It's a win, but the coach is still looking for something to fix first.
You can always complain.
Some of our mistakes were unwarranted, the opponent received light free throws and lived on them.
This has happened to us before - if you go aggressively defending, there is a risk of overdoing it.
Let's draw our own conclusions", said Rego.
He used nine players today, while Robin Stone missed a few encounters due to injury still remained on the bench.
These decisions are made on an ongoing basis.
Kivi made morning training and pre-game warm-up, but was still not 100% ready", explained the supervisor.
Tomorrow at 6:15 p.m., Estonia will meet Great Britain in the semifinals, who defeated Bulgaria at 76:73 today.
The winner of this game will raise his country's U18 age class to EM's A-division next summer.
Video: Vasiliev overthrew the second penalty for the new club
Piast missed a loss in the ninth minute of the game held at home field against Wroclawi Slash, but managed to tie 20 minutes later.
Vasilyev had a great chance to secure Piast the first win of the season.
Four minutes before the normal time was fulfilled, the quarterback missed the penalty.
The match ended in a 1:1 draw.
Piast has collected two points in four rounds and is ranked 15th in the league table.
How do you keep sex exciting when you're trying to have a baby?
So it's very important to keep the passions burning, even when you're trying to create a new life.
Female First gives advice on how to make sex not seem like a tedious obligation.
Don't take this as an obligation.
This can happen to any couple trying to get pregnant.
Sometimes it may take years to become pregnant.
Order after sex takes away spontaneity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel unable to enjoy "normal" sex at the end of a cycle when it is known that no positive outcome will come.
This creates tension in the relationship, which in turn leads to a decrease in sex, and less sex, of course, means an even greater chance of not getting pregnant.
Men feel, however, that they must be able to "present" when required to do so.
If you know your fruitful days in advance, it can help you plan something romantic with your boyfriend.
Whether it's a special dinner or just hanging out - enjoy each other!
Consider the productive period.
From the point of view of reproduction, there is no point in having sex when evolution has taken place, but in order for your relationship to flourish, try to have sex for pleasure on non-productive days.
Although there is no evidence that pregnancy will occur more firmly than a woman will have an orgasm, do not forget!
Remember, each pair is different.
Everybody can handle baby stress differently.
Some men want to be familiar with a woman's cycle, while others prefer not to know that they do not feel pressured to "play on demand".
No one knows better than you.
Find your solution!
Studies have shown that higher chances of success are for couples who have sex every few days, but not every couple can keep that density.
The most important thing is to find the pattern that suits you best as a couple.
IAAF warns that fraudsters are being watched sharply at London World Championships
On Friday, the World Athletics Championships will begin in London, and athletes will be in more spotlight than ever in connection with doping scandals.
These World Championships are the first to be guarded by the new body, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which also monitors corruption, gambling and counterfeiting of results.
"It cannot be ruled out that human nature does not allow such things to happen.
We can say, however, that we have the best practices and the best anti-doping program that can exist at all now based on information and data collection, and we will see the result after the event," said AIU spokesman David Howman.
The AIU has allowed 19 athletes from around 190 Russian athletes who have been caught with drugs to compete as neutral athletes.
Examined: Levadia destroyed Paide City team in home square
Levadia has put herself in a difficult position, as in the previous round Viljandi Future was lost in surprise and table leader Flora took advantage of the opportunity, slipping seven points away.
From behind, however, Nõmme Kalju has reached the same stick as Levadia.
Paide, who enlisted during the summer transition window, continues to miss the captain and midfield maestro Andre Frolov.
Of the last seven games, only two draw points have been picked, the league table is ranked eighth - four points behind Tartu Tammekas and four points ahead of the future.
Levadiale lost 0:7 in the first game between him and 2:5 in the second.
"My watch died, but I didn't", starred actor Raivo E. Tamme in the face of Ironman 70.3 in the finish line with a wide smile.
True, during the whole half-long triathlon, Raivo was never left with a smile.
Moreover, running 21.1 kilometers, he had a conversation: "I talked to one person during the run, a man ran by and wondered, 'Lord, you can still talk!'
Raivo, who had enough energy to tell the story, went on a speed trip a few times.
On the advice of the coach.
"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that you can walk uphill, that there is no point in pushing to run, because there are such tides here and it doesn't really matter much in time whether you run or make a quick walk," the actor says he took the advice of a triathlete instructor.
At the same time, he was able to catch his breath when walking, and after crossing the finish line, he was able to share interviews to the left and right without breathing.
It's like there's no 1.9 kilometers of swimming behind you, 90 kilometers of cycling, and 21.1 kilometers of running.
"I think my training will also be such that I can enjoy this competition", admits Raivo, who started training in January and lost 16 kg of his body weight today, with a contention.
And as for the interviews, it was my wish to be able to give interviews after the finish.
I've been able to give interviews every race, and I was hoping it would be nice to be able to do that after Otepää Ironman.
I thought it would be all right if I wasn't down on the west side after Ironman." In contrast to the fascinating west side state, Raivo offered a completely different picture when crossing the finish line: his hands triumphantly towards the sky and his face glowing with a sincere triumph.
There were also reasons: It took Raivol to swim 1.9 km for 46 minutes and 24 seconds, 90 km for a bike ride for 3 hours and 32 minutes and 21.1 km for a run of 2 hours and 18 minutes.
"My heart is now given to the triathlon", says Raivo, who already in the finiśi shouted that he gave the sport a finger and it took the ring's takkapihta.
Already registered to Gran Fondo on August 20th - 230 km from Tallinn to Tartu by bike!
So, practice again tomorrow!
Disney's longtime advisor and manager Marty Sklar died at the age of 83
Sklar, who died on July 27 in his home in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, maintained ties with the company after retiring in 2009, which had been timed exactly to the 54th anniversary of the opening of Disneyland.
Last year, he became the only member of the company on the opening day of Shanghai Disney in China (so the company invites its employees) to have participated in the opening of all 12 Disney parks around the world.
And less than two weeks before his death, he attended the Disney fan reunion D23, sharing recollections of Disneyland.
His death was reported by the Disney Company without mentioning its cause.
He was 83 years old.
Sklar's post as editor of the newspaper The Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to Disneyland after graduating from U.C.L.A. in 1956 to work in its advertising department.
He soon became Walt Disney's main shadow author in writing promotional materials, dedications, souvenir guides, speeches, slogans, presentations, and short films, such as a piece of writing that helped the company gain approval for the construction of Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also collaborated with Walt and his brother Roy on Disney's annual reports.
"These were quite mind-blowing times for someone who only approached his 30th birthday and had only six or seven years since graduation from college," Sklar wrote in his autobiography "Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms" (2013).
However, despite trusting Sklar in the writings, Walt Disney assigned Sklar to the Ford Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair, where Disney Company designed shows and attractions.
Sklar wrote a narrative for Walt Disney for the Ford pavilion attraction Magic Skyway, where animatronic dinosaurs and cavemen could be seen and which was their main link with large corporate sponsors.
This was the beginning of Sklar's second act in the company.
As an ever-increasing member and head of the Imaginers, he was increasingly associated with Walt Disney's legacy, who died in late 1966 long before Walt Disney World opened in 1971 and Epcot opened in 1982.
After Walt Disney died of lung cancer at the age of 65, Sklar was thrown back into the writing world when he was told that the company's executives had not prepared a public statement, although "it was no secret that Walt was dying", as he writes in his autobiography.
Sklar, according to himself, felt indignation that he had to write a statement to which Roy Disney would sign, but he realized that the lack of planning was a sign that Walt Disney's death had paralyzed the company's executives.
"In reality, they were all scared to death," Sklar wrote.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in February in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
His father Leon was a teacher and mother, maiden name Lilyn Fuchs, worked for the company Johnson & Johnson before the family moved to Long Beach, California, when Marty was 12.
After high school, he had a number of temporary jobs, such as working both at Douglas Aircraft, as an ice cream shoveler on a hamburger restaurant drive-in, and as a postal parcel delivery carrier.
However, in May 1955, when his third year at U.C.L.A. was coming to an end, Sklar received a message to call Disney's marketing and advertising manager, E. Cardon Walker.
At the time, Sklar was the new editor-in-chief of the U.C.L.A. student newspaper The Daily Bruin.
Walker asked him to come to the job interview for the position of creator and editor of The Disneyland News newspaper.
Walker said the theme park would be opened soon.
And it needs him.
Walker hired him after a 20-minute interview.
Sklar, however, also had to prove to Walt Disney that he knew what he was doing.
"I had been working there for two weeks and had to present the concept of a page to Walt Disney," he recalled in a podcast on the Disney Avenue website.
"If Walt didn't like it, he would have thrown me out the door and hired a professional.
But luckily, Walt liked it.
I was 21.
That was scary.
I had never worked on a professional level."
Sklar formed the lessons of Walt Disney (and also some other person) at one point into "Miki's Ten Commandments", or the theme park board manifesto.
Commands include, for example, the following: Know your target audience.
Try to "put yourself in the shoes of visitors" to experience an attraction like them.
Tell only one story at a time for each attraction.
Theme entertainment expert Bob Rogers once called Sklar "a wizard's apprentice" - a role played by Miki-Hiir in the Disney film "Fantasy" (1940) - as he had mediated Disney's philosophy to three generations of designers.
Sklarist is left behind by her husband, maiden name Leah Gerber, daughter Leslie Sklar, son Howard and four grandchildren.
Sklar was Disney's dedicated leader.
She regularly wore a miki-mouse clock with three sihver plates (which showed her the time in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and a miki-moire gold ring.
And he never forgot anything Walt Disney had taught him.
When the Disney Company developed the children's area of California Adventure Park, Sklar reminded planners to add activities that parents and children could jointly do, as Walt Disney had demanded.
"I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed at all because Walt used to take his daughters Diane i and Sharon to Griffith Park to ride a carousel," he told The Los Angeles Times magazine in 2002, "and Daddy had to sit on a park bench and eat peanuts and popcorn while the kids were driving alone."
The police took over 200 people to the station during the Weekend.
In total, more than 20 crimes were recorded in the city of Pärnu during the festival days.
There are reasons to associate about half of them with the music festival, with large amounts of drug possession and two drunken driving being recorded alongside the use of violence.
One hundred misdemeanour proceedings were mainly related to the use or possession of underage or illicit substances who had consumed alcohol.
The letter received some theft and a violation of public policy.
More than 200 people were brought to the police station by law enforcement officers for various reasons.
About half a hundred of them were minors, and the main reason for delivering the police station was alcohol.
Last year, twice as many minors had been brought to the station.
Half a hundred people were also taken to Kainenema, perhaps as much as they did last year.
According to Andres Sinimer, the head of the Pärnu Police Department, the above numbers are expected in view of the large crowd.
As in previous years, we had prepared thoroughly for the weekend this year.
We engaged additional forces from other prefectures, police cadets and auxiliary police officers to ensure that we were ready to react quickly.
Most of the situations were resolved by word and it was enough for the law enforcement to communicate with the citizens.
"Apparently, there were no misdemeanors, because the police were visible in the city and felt enough in our estimation", said Sinimeri.
According to his opinion, it was extremely positive that the number of minors who drank alcohol was clearly fewer, and the young proved that the party was sober.
He praised the security company's top-ranked team for taking care of security in the festival area.
I thank all the festival guests who behaved politely and feasted safely.
"I would also like to thank the local people who, with their understanding attitude, contributed to the success of the grand festival", said the head of police.
In Pärnu police station, the owners are waiting for the items found in the city and festival area during the weekend.
According to Annika Pärna, the manager of Pärnu service who was responsible for returning the finds in the festival area, there were fewer items lost this year than last year.
More than half of the finds were returned to the owners in the police tent of the festival area.
The most lost were bank cards, identification documents, mobile phones and keys within three days.
"At present, 13 more cell phones, three wallets, a laptop, a smart clock and several car keys are waiting for the owner of the station", Pärna listed.
A 101-year-old man jumped off a plane.
World War II veteran Verdun Hayes recently received a military award to mark a parachute jump that shattered his world record.
In fact, at 101 years and 38 days of age, the man committed a feat, becoming the oldest man in the world to make parachute jumps.
Business group rushes government to negotiate Brexit transition terms
One of Britain's largest groups of business lobbyists urges the government to stop dancing around the outskirts of Brexit.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) appealed to the government for a "transition agreement" to make progress smooth with Brexit.
It is desired that the government set up a bridge across the "Brexit rift" between leaving the EU and the establishment of new trade agreements.
The group warned that without such an agreement, business would face "short-term chaotic swing on the edge of the cliff".
They criticized the government for complicity in "the transition in all kinds of speculative disputes."
In recent weeks, government members have presented conflicting views on how long the transition period will last and what it will entail.
The IoD report "Stilling the Brexit divide - opportunities for transition" reads: "Instead of stumbling the problem from afar, the government must create a strategic debate around this issue.
This could minimise the growing confusion and uncertainty in this area."
Gerard Lyons, an economist and leading figure of the group Economists for Brexit, however, described this week's concern over the "shattering on the edge of the cliff" Brexit as "the talk of panic-makers", reminiscent of Y2K's fear of computer program error at the turn of the millennium.
Treasury Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in June, "There is a large number of business investments that will be postponed until companies see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions is."
Allie Renison, head of IoD's EU and trade policy, said, "The Chancellor has the right to worry about delaying business investment.
This is one of the most frequently considered changes to be addressed in relation to Brexit, alongside the relocation of functions to the EU.
The latter applies especially to IoD Northern Ireland members currently considering co-location or relocation."
IoD proposes a number of options, including the following: Extension of Article 50 agreement beyond March 2019
Accession to the European Economic Area
Consent to stay longer within the scope of EU law
Establishment of a transitional customs agreement similar to the EU Customs Union
Renison said, "The IoD proposed these options in connection with the transition, hoping it will spark an appropriate debate on how best to complete Brexit.
Prioritising intermediate arrangements and thus mitigating the risks of exit from the EU means that short-term chaotic fluctuations on the cliff edge will not diminish future opportunities."
Russian Railway explores the possibility of starting a St. Petersburg-Kaliningrad-Berlin passenger train
The Russian Railway is investigating the possibility of setting up a Berlin-Peterbur train line via Kaliningrad, reported Viktor Golomolzin, director of the Kaliningrad Railway, to Interfax Severo-Zapad.
The monitoring of passenger traffic tells us that from an economic point of view, it is hardly possible to restart the Kaliningrad-Berlin trains.
And we offer another route - Berlin-Kaliningrad-Peterbur.
There are technical possibilities for this in terms of both infrastructure and rolling stock", Golomolzin said.
Golomolzin further noted that Russian trains already exist, on which it can switch tracks and continue to move on the European track.
Golomolzin considers this direction to be far-reaching, as the inhabitants of St. Petersburg and the entire north-west of Russia now have to travel to Germany through Moscow and Brest.
As a possible option, the route will be discussed through Latvia, confirmed to the Latvian Delfi the Latvian Railway (Latvijas Dzelzceļš) spokesperson Māris Ozols, according to whom there is currently no specific decision, but the option is under discussion.
The Latvian Railway, together with its partners, including the Russian Railway, is seeking to increase competitiveness in the service of the passenger flow so that rail transport can compete with road transport.
Pakistani Hindus Can't Find Asylum in India
Seventy years after the largest population migration in the history of the separation of the two countries, Hindus are still moving from Pakistan to India.
Tens of thousands of people, who do not even have the legal right to work in India, are already waiting for them in the gypsum camps on the border between the two countries.
Thus, many have no choice but to work illegally near temporary habitats in the quarry - the Indian authorities are watching the movements of those on the other side of the border very closely.
Most people from Pakistan do not expect such reception.
No work, no house, no money, no food.
That's where we worked in the fields, we were peasants.
This is where people like us are forced to break stones to make a living", said 81-year-old Jogdas.
For us, the division is not over.
The Hindus are still trying to return to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing", added an elderly man living in a field camp near Jodhpur town.
After India's independence from British colonial rule in 1947, over 15 million people lost their homes.
Separation caused months of violence in which at least a million people lost their lives because of religious hatred.
In the midst of bloody chaos, Hindus and Sikhs fled the newly formed Pakistan, while Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite the emigration, Hindus are still one of Pakistan's most numerous minority groups.
In various estimates, they make up about 1.6 percent of the country's 200-million-dollar population.
Many of them complain of constant discrimination and fear robbery, rape, and forced marriage.
"The persecution began soon after the separation", said Jogdas, whose family moved just a few months before the split between the two countries to escape the drought into the areas of present-day Pakistan.
Not a day went by when we could have lived in peace.
I wanted to come back to live among my Hindu brothers.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's national government has said it wishes to make it easier for those persecuted for religious reasons to find asylum in India.
Last year, the government began to allow immigrants to apply for citizenship at their place of residence; previously, the entire process was handled through the central government.
Hindus who relocated from Pakistan to India have the opportunity to gain quick citizenship after seven years of residence in the country.
However, due to bureaucratic delays, this process is often much more time-consuming.
The 64-year-old Khanaramji left Pakistan in 1997 and received Indian citizenship in 2005.
According to him, however, many have given up and returned to Pakistan as they see that they do not expect a good life in India.
The government does not provide any support.
We're like no-owner cattle.
Just trying to survive on our own", said Khanaramji.
But even worse than poverty is the skepticism of the authorities.
Those who do not have citizenship must suffer harassment from intelligence agencies.
They are constantly being treated as suspects and Pakistani agents", he explained.
Singh Sodhal, who founded a charity dedicated to helping Hindus who came from Jodhpur, Pakistan, had high expectations of Modi who came to power in 2014, but has now been disappointed.
During Modi's reign, tensions between India and Pakistan have increased, and the migrants are most affected as a result.
"Their lives become hell", Sodhal said.
For many, though, such treatment is better than life in Pakistan.
Horoji and two grown sons fled to India two years ago because he had begun to receive death threats from his Pakistani neighbors.
"To save our lives, we had to flee to India", said 65-year-old Horoji, whose grandparents had come from areas of present-day India, but found themselves splitting off the country from the wrong side of the border.
My grandfather moved to the other side for work.
But he told us to move to India at the right moment because he knew that the future might be dangerous for the Hindus.
I think we've done quite well.
We have done well with our work and activities", says Pärnu police leader Andres Sinimeri, how the first two days of the Weekend have worked out for them.
Sinimeri says that even today, patrol police and emergency responders are on the streets, as well as interacting with people - perhaps they have questions and also want to know how to become a rapid reactant.
Within two days, police have had to deal with some fights as well as drug cases.
"There have also been some handling of a large amount of narcotics, but we will summarise when the Weekend is over", Sinimeri says.
Around a hundred people have visited the Pärnu Police Department in the last two days.
Fortunately, there was no need for the police to solve extreme cases.
By the way, Sinimeri says that if there's rain coming from the sky sharply and horizontally, they don't have a lot of work to do.
A field manager from Haapsalu Police has once said that rain is like an extra patrol.
Pärnu police have also made a staff in the Weekend area, where you can take the things you have found and from there you can also claim your lost things.
By the way, the police even lost one of their necessary gadgets delivered to the point of discovery by good people.
Take a look at the video that Andres Sinimeri told Õhtuleht.
Multiple Emmy nominations by screenwriter and producer Neal Baer cost $4.35 million for a home in Hollywood Hills West, with roots dating back to the atomic age.
The modernist style house of the middle of this century was designed in 1945 by Josef Van der Kar and named after the original owners, the nuclear weapons strategists Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter as Wohlstetter's house.
The 255-square-foot house on the side of the driveway, surrounded by gates, has wide glass sliding doors that open into the garden, terrace and courtyard.
The living and dining room has a cork floor covering, a fireplace and portable panels that open into the kitchen.
The main part of the house consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
The enclosure also houses a separate guesthouse with a view to the giant fish pond and sleeping veranda.
The separate building also has a bathroom and an additional storage room.
Albert Wohlstetter was an influential nuclear strategist during the Cold War.
Roberta Wohlstetter's analysis of intelligence failures prior to the Pearl Harbor attack was also cited by the September 11 Commission of Inquiry.
Wohlstetters have advised both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations, including John F. Kennedy, during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
They received the Presidential Freedom Medal from Ronald Reagan in 1985.
Baer is best known for his work in television dramas "The Quick Aid Hospital" and "On behalf of the Law: Sexual Crime Investigation Unit".
Real estate agents included Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane from the company Deasy/Penner and Partners.
The buyer was represented by Hattie Ramirez of the company Keller Williams Realty.
The plane drew a perfect image of itself above the U.S.
The pilot took a passenger plane on a zigzag nationwide flight over the United States and was even able to have some fun along the route.
The aircraft's real-time flight path data indicated that it was not just a straight line or an arc, but a series of flight paths that formed the image of the aircraft when connected.
Flight BOE004 departed from Boeing Field Airport at approximately 3:40 p.m. local time on Wednesday, according to Flight Radar 24, which monitors real-time air traffic.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took the course east across Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota before abruptly changing course and flying southwestward.
Viewed from the map, the aircraft's strange route depicts a two-engined passenger aircraft.
According to Boeing, the flight is part of the aircraft's 18-hour "resistance" test.
"Instead of flying in any pattern, the testing team unleashed its imagination by driving a route that formed 787-8 contours over 22 states," a spokesman for the Boeing Company told portal RT.com.
"Dreamliner's nose points to Puget Sound area where the home of Boeing Commercial Airplanes is located.
The wings extend from northern Michigan near the Canadian border to southern Texas.
The tail touches Huntsville in Alabama," he added.
Boeing's long-distance aircraft 787-8 Dreamliner was introduced in 2009.
The aircraft can accommodate up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 13,600 kilometers.
Because the pilot used the radar as a personal canvas, the flight generated a tremendous interest among the aircraft trackers on the web.
Some suspected that it was a test flight, while others suggested that it might be a strange coincidence.
cartoons affecting the dress style of Estonian children
While in Europe and America, children are often shaped by those of royal families or celebrities, Estonian parents choose clothes for their young children based on what is happening in cinema.
The little British Prince Georg is about to become a real fashion guru, following the example of Duchess Cahterine.
Like his mother, the prince is able to trigger a real shopping frenzy in people with his clothes, which has even become a concept in its own right - the effect of Prince George.
The last such event took place a few weeks ago on a visit from the royal family to Poland, where George wore a blue-and-red striped shirt with a Spanish brand in Tizza, which was bought by mad parents in 24 hours.
There were probably not a lot of shoppers from Estonia, because the children’s robes are supposed to leave our parents completely cold.
Anna Ansmitt, the head of communications at the mall, notes that the children of star couples and foreign fashion trends generally do not affect our parents' purchases for their children.
In Estonia, films, cartoons and Youtube channels are the biggest trends in the purchase of children's affairs.
So the most popular products in recent years are fingertips, games with cartoon "Frozen" characters, dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, peeling penguins and so on".
At the same time, he assures us that if you wish, you can dress your children in the same way as princes or princesses in Europe.
The Centre Party does not recommend a prepared Savisaare alliance
The leaders of the Centre Party regions all over Estonia addressed the public and the party's colleagues, inviting them to vote for the Centre Party and not for the electoral alliances.
In particular, this message is intended for those who are considering between the Edgar Savisaar Electoral Union and the Centre Party.
How Princess Diana used her makeup as a weapon
When I think of Princess Diana's makeup, the first thing I see is an eyeliner.
Younger girly blue.
Later, a thick black waver line in his Martin Bashir's "Panorama" interview, the effect of which was devastating when he looked up through thick eyelashes, bringing out the immortal phrase: "We had three in this marriage, so it was a little too crowded."
The large and wet eyes, surrounded by his quirky, pale face with a thick black line, made him look like a wounded animal.
That's exactly the effect he was trying to achieve.
Outside the public, however, Princess Diana never wore much makeup, at least not by modern standards.
It wasn't just that he didn't need it - he was beautiful, of course - but he saw in it a tedious duty, something to do with work rather than pleasure.
In front of the public, he could wear a thick layer of makeup.
He once arrived at the office of the publishers of Conde Nast, Vogue, wearing a thick, almost orange layer of make-up cream.
He apologized, saying that his skin would have to shine, as if he were going out of the sun "normally", then the pomposity photographers would photograph him and then make all accusations that he looked "bright", "stupid" and "tired".
That is why Diana visited the tanning salon three times a week, using the machine in her home.
Today, such a practice would, of course, be resented for health reasons, but for Diana, it had a useful purpose - it allowed her to show the world her sunny nature, even though her interior was filled with black clouds and thunder.
Perhaps one of the biggest mistakes of the royal family was to think that if they approved her as Charles’ husband, they would have a beautiful little mare with only cotton candy in its brain.
The reality, however, was quite the opposite.
He may not have been the best in his class at school, but when it came to creating an image, he was a straight-up five-year-old.
For Diana, the importance of hairstyle and makeup was that they could be used to convey moods or hours.
Otherwise, he was not interested in them.
Her friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was the godmother of her youngest child - remembers that makeup was not something they used to talk about.
"I only remember this," he said, "how much relief he felt on those occasions when we went to rest together and he didn't have to make up himself."
Today, we tend to think of makeup as something that enhances a woman's appearance, but looking back at Diana's lifeline, it's clear that she used it as a powerful public relations tool.
Those moments when he felt most at ease were his own, those moments when he was also the most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, with her two young sons driving down the Loggers Leap attraction at Thorpe Park, she was wet and laughed from the heart, with a mascara in front of her eyes scattered like any other mother who spends a day with children.
Four months after the announcement of her and Charles' separation, she finally looked defiantly carefree and "ordinary".
Or, in later years, by evicting the gym, by putting the hair behind it, by putting the feet in their bicycle pants in uniform, by bloating the face of the training, health and vitality blowing up every pore of his.
Toward the end of his life, when he began to assert his independence and his confidence grew, we saw more and more such Diana.
He linked up with Halo Trust and walked through the Angola minefield in January 1997.
At that moment, at the age of 35, hair soft and natural, face almost completely make-up-free, she probably looked more beautiful than ever, reminiscent of that bright and hopeful young girl who smiled on a photo of engagement 15 years ago.
Diana was just getting into her best years.
In early times, young Diana Spencer had a dreamy pre-Raffael nature.
But it wasn't long before "Princessification" began - a process that was mainly conducted by the press and palace to make Diana a refined young lady worthy of her new standing.
Partly this involved the handwork of Clayton Howard, a veteran make-up artist often used by Lord Snowdon in photo shoots.
Howard met fearful Diana for the first time at the Kensington Town Hall in Snowdon to capture the official engagement picture for the magazine Vogue.
At this point, in the late 1980s, Diana was still an empty canvas.
Her finest beauty products were from The Body Shop, such as the Elderflower eye gel.
Howard used Max Factor's makeup cream Sheer Genius with tone Honey Touch and Max Factor's cheek stick with tone Frosted Coral.
On the eyelids, she wore Elizabeth Arden's tones Rice and Timberland, and on the brow a white frosting-effect eye shadow.
The appearance was improved by Elizabeth Arden's blue eyelash and blue contour pen.
And we know all this because Howard created a facial scheme for her.
"Diana's eyes are such an admirable color that I wished to emphasize their striking blueness," he later wrote.
The end result, however, is not very flattering for such a young girl - she looks like an 18-year-old who is about to turn 50.
Her eyebrows are too oppressive and too dull brown applied to her eyes.
The most striking one here is the infamous eyeliner at the inner edge of the eyelid in that ghostly blue tone of Disney Princess.
Fantasy for a fantasy bride.
No wonder Diana's looking at us a little insecure.
One source of Diana's anguish was the fact that she never knew where the public person would end and start private.
This was the beginning of this process.
The person most likely to influence Diana’s appearance was Mary Greenwell, who still plays an important role in today’s makeup world.
The make-up artist, who is currently an ambassador to Chanel among others, is still one of the icons of the make-up world.
"Diana had incredibly beautiful skin and long limbs," she recalls.
"He was just beautiful.
The men adored him.
She was sexy without having caught it."
Mary first met Diana in 1991, when Vogue's then-captain Anna Harvey asked her to make makeup for Diana before the December issue photo session with one of the magazine's most appreciated photographers, Patrick Demarchelier.
The team also included hairdresser Sam McKnight.
This occurred when Diana and Charles had the biggest marital problems and fighting began for public support.
"They didn't tell us who it was, although we knew it was someone very famous," Greenwell said.
"When we got there, Diana was just standing beautifully there, warm and friendly and extremely excited to be on Vogue's cover."
This cover picture - Diana in a simple black sweater, her chin leaning on her hands, her blue eyes bright, her nails elegant French manicure, her hair cut short - was groundbreaking.
From it radiated positivity, individuality, and elegance.
Above all, it was modern, conveying the clandestine minimalist aesthetic of the early nineties, and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the royal family, facing a "annus horribilis", as the Queen later called it.
"Diana was very relaxed about her makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and different," Greenwell said.
Over time, she taught Diana to make up herself - cream, make-up cream, hidestick for eyelifting, eyelashes - and emphasized a healthy skin care routine, encouraging her to take good care of herself and follow the mantra of "inner beauty".
Diana "did everything in moderation", says Greenwell.
He slept well and reduced alcohol consumption, which is very important for fresh-looking skin.
The princess preferred Guerlain's make-up cream, Clarins lipstick, and Clinique's Wild Rose blush.
But the biggest favor Mary did to Diana was her weaning from the blue eyeliner.
"It just made him so much older," he said.
Instead, he used a combination of soft brown and neutral tones with a brown pencil line on the eyelash border, which were blended together, so all edges were beautifully soft.
She often used just a tinting cream and a little sun powder to emphasize Diana’s healthy brilliance.
"Diana used to call me and invite me to her house to discuss the products, which I liked to do very much," Greenwell told me.
"I think it was relaxing for him; a chance to take a few moments for himself."
His favorite was the luxury brand Clarins.
Diana reportedly used day and night cream for their sensitive skin as well as cleaning milk and toner with their Alpine herbs.
She also regularly attended the beauty salon of the cosmeticist Janet Filderman in central London for facial care.
Diana had famously beautiful skin, but sometimes she had rosacea, moderate cheek rash, often due to stress.
To alleviate this, he used natural soothing oils, including briquette oil.
"Diana had an unparalleled bone structure," Greenwell said.
The only part of his appearance he wasn't very confident about was his nose.
Anna Harvey recalls, "Once the newspapers wrote that she had been having a nose job, she turned to me and said, laughing, 'Truly if I had let my nose be operated on, do you think I would have chosen one of these?"
As Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight's advice began to materialize, Diana felt more confident about her new appearance.
One of his most memorable public appearances - in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he wore a famous "hand-to-hand tax dress", a provocative, bare-shouldered figure from Christina Stambolian - shows that the signature style of his senior years was beginning to develop.
Diana is sexy and dynamic at the same time with short hair combed over her ears, her short hairstyle in sharp contrast with a very challenging black silk dress.
His makeup is perfect - flattering but at the same time modest, black eyeliner emphasizing the blueness of his eyes.
Without losing sight of bright colors, especially red ones, he wore a shiny red nail polish, quite likely Revlon Red, which then became a trademark in some respects.
A few months later, he flashed his elegant red manicure at the Royal College of Nursing.
The princess was a model of health and self-confidence.
And he finally had complete control.
In tan and shape, his makeup flawless, he conveys exactly what he wants the viewers to think: here is a woman who seems to have a sense of self and purpose in life at last and who, having just become 36, has found her place.
It's a real shame he couldn't prove it to himself.
Southwest Japan prepares for the arrival of typhoon Noru
Much of south-west Japan, including the areas devastated by the rainstorms last month, prepared for even more rain on Friday than the typhoon Noru, which was at one point the world's strongest storm, was moving closer and closer to the country's main islands.
According to the Meteorological Office, the Amami archipelago, just south of Kyushu Island in the southwest and about 1,350 km from Tokyo, is hit by strong winds and heavy rainfall on Friday afternoon, and it is possible that up to 800 mm of rainfall will fall over the next 48 hours.
A spokesman for the Meteorological Board said that Noru, which stands for a certain type of deer in Korean, would then probably turn north and water it with rain over Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, hit by rainstorms and floods last month that killed 36 people and left four missing, would probably escape the worst.
"This is an extremely slow-moving storm," he added, noting that there is therefore a greater risk of flooding, as there is heavy rainfall in one area over a longer period of time.
The Noru, which was at one point a Category 5 typhoon and is an unusually long-lived storm, formed first two weeks ago and wandered in circles along the northern Pacific Ocean before heading northwest, taking aim at Japan and weakening on its approach journey.
The representative added that depending on the change of course, Noru may move directly across Kyushu and then along the Japanese island of Honshu, but the longer journey is still difficult to determine.
There are places in the landscape where, if necessary, conventional vehicles can't easily get to, even if they want to.
There's the solution to ATV.
About ATVs used in the military field, the Defence Home gave an overview!
The use of such lightweight and well-permeable vehicles in military structures is nothing new.
The need for them arose even during World War II, but more attention began to be paid to them a decade later.
Simplicity and robustness
As early as 1956, the M-274 - an improvement from a vehicle designed to evacuate the wounded, was rolled out of Willys Overland's factories under the name of a mechanical mule - in the late years of the Second World War.
It's a little strange to call a mechanical mule a development.
It's hard to imagine a more ascetic vehicle.
Wheeled platform, seat and steering: everything, all luxury.
It's as if too much designers stole too quickly the blueprints from the engineering desk and started manufacturing quickly.
In war, however, permeability is much more important than comfort.
There was no opponent of the mule tested in the jungles of Vietnam in this category.
The light machine, weighing less than five hundred kilograms, barely escaped shocking even in those places where the Mythological Jeep of Willys, who had accumulated his superpermeability, had to show his brake lights in a submissive manner.
Mostly, vehicles with a carrying capacity of nearly 500 kg were used for transport operations, both for carrying money and for carrying the manpower.
At other times lighter, non-return anti-tank weapons were also installed on the mule's back.
However, such a truck came under fire, and that still happened, the driver was able to move the steering system forward in the final emergency and let it go so low that the vehicle could be driven on its stomach.
The mules were produced until 1970, they were completed in total 11,240 and were in use in the army until 1980, when they were replaced by HMMWVs who had made the race.
For the two decades that followed, ATVs held rather marginal significance in military circles.
They returned to the picture after two towers fell to the ground in New York City, and U.S. soldiers found themselves crashing into desert landscapes in Iraq and Afghanistan.
It was there that the knowledge and understanding were born that something was needed to fill the gap between Humwee and the infantry.
Since ATV generally does not offer considerable protection, it is not the best choice to carry out combat tasks directly.
However, fast and light machines are suitable for special tasks.
For example, in reconnaissance and rescue operations.
There are currently thousands of ATVs and UTVs in use in the American military.
Most of them, like the XUV550d acquired for the Defence League, are essentially similar to those in civilian circulation, but supplemented according to the needs of the army.
The brands that have become camouflage are represented by names such as Kawasakilt Mule, Hondalt Rancher and Foreman, Yamahalt Rhino and Arctic Cat, and the ever-expanding selection of Polaris models, the leading military-ATV manufacturer.
In 2013, Polaris signed a five-year contract with the American Special Forces Center (SOCOM) for the delivery of two-seat MRZR2 and MRZR4, and a separate five-year contract for single-seat Polaris Sportsman-based MV850s with both infrared and blackout lights and innovative beecomb-like tires that provide mobility even after being hit by a 50-caliber weapon.
Prior to the MV850 entering the market, Polaris was able to deliver MV700 and MV800 vehicles to the military.
The MV700 is a militaryized version of the Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman made for civil use, with the addition of winches in the front and back, a two-part fuel tank to cover greater distances, a reinforced frame and base, and some other military equipment with which farmers or the same forest musclers do not have more to go.
Like the John Deere M-Gators used successfully in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside Polaris ATVs, it is equipped with gun mounts, luggage racks on the hood and some other elements useless in the ranches but necessary in the combat zone.
A 750 - kg - weight vehicle can carry almost its own weight, or 570 pounds [570 kg] of stuff.
The engine power is also sufficient to carry lighter after-carts and artillery parts.
The rear of the variable-shaped box, with its sides removable, makes it possible to drive baggage from point A to point B, which is larger than the size of this small but persistent insect.
Later, the upgraded versions of the M-Gator also produced A1, which is 20 horsepower more powerful than the original 20-horse-powered M-Gator, and the subsequent reinforced frame A2, which is even better for carrying and towing weights, and A3, which combine the positive features of the A1 and A2.
The Fire Crosses actually received M-Gators as early as 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, where medical brigades used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they also reduced the load on soldiers moving on their own feet by carrying stuff that would otherwise have to be carried on their backs.
If the majority of ATVs in use in power structures are modifications to vehicles used for civil use, there are also some exceptions.
The most prominent of these are the Prowler-named warhorses made at Phoenix International, which have been used successfully in all manner of combat, reconnaissance and rescue missions around the world.
According to the manufacturer, these vehicles, first introduced ten years ago and created for special operations, have been overtaken by bottlenecks which are characteristic of ATVs in normal use as well as those modified for the Army, both in terms of driverability, durability and safety.
Being similar in construction and size externally to normal ATV, Prowler is still totally different in design and performance.
It is faster, more durable, more stable and is able to carry and carry greater weights than other similar vehicles.
For example, if, in the case of a normal ATV, the driver has to play continuously with his body position to maintain the vehicle's balance and use both hands to maneuver, accelerate and brake, then driving a Prowler is more like driving a car.
In the end, however, it does not matter whether Prowler, Gator, MV850, or any other ATV or UTV concept and field of use are similar to all of them.
And it is clear that in circumstances where attempts are being made to reduce defence costs in general and smaller-scale, target-oriented skirmishes are being practiced instead of a wide-scale conventional war, lightweight and fast light-duty light-duty vehicles have joined the army to remain in service.
As a result of the departmental blunder, sensitive data on vulnerable children under care were published
As a result of a worrying breach of information, the mother of one child was wrongly sent personal data of the children under care, including information on whether they were sexually active.
A table was sent to the mother by e-mail containing the names, birth dates, locations, and places of particular concern and attention for all children in the care of a large provider operating in the city of Victoria.
The e-mail revealed the residence of each child.
The list states that a 13-year-old boy has been released on bail and that sexual behavior manifests in his case, that a 15-year-old girl with problems with self-harm, abuse of certain substances, and running away is "out with her boyfriend" and "not returning tonight", and that a 14-year-old boy needs help with "care for himself" and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The table appears to be a handover document intended to be sent to the night shift supervisor.
The document contains notes on when to expect a child at home or whether they can contact the staff in order to catch up.
An alarming number of details have been given for some children.
For a 15-year-old boy, it is written warningly: "If staff contact to obtain permission to search a room and/or review a laptop/USB device due to suspicion of inappropriate sexual material, this authorization must be granted."
The document also states that in the case of a 17-year-old girl who turns 18 in just three months and is released from institutional care, the risk of attempted suicide is so high that the staff must call the emergency line immediately if she escapes.
For a 16-year-old paroled boy, it was noted that he was out and "will contact the staff later to catch up with him".
Although only the name of the accommodation unit where the children are kept and not their addresses are mentioned for the listed locations, there are still enough details to allow them to be found.
The 2015 data leak came out when a mother shared her experience with Fairfax Media in communicating with the Department of Health and Services and Child Protection since taking her daughter into custody four years ago.
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had turned 18 and had left the system.
The heartbreaking decision to hand over their daughter to child welfare was made after a violent incident at home, one of the increasing number of complaints of domestic violence brought by parents against their children.
For example, within six months of leaving home, his daughter was able to receive seven criminal charges; she was moved hundreds of miles away from home and into a situation where she seemed to cope successfully, but then she was moved back without informing her parents; in addition, her daughter’s guardians accepted and facilitated the relationship between her daughter and her older husband.
The relationship with the first of these boyfriends, a 17-year-old with whom welfare institutions allowed a woman's then 15-year-old daughter to stay regularly in a local hotel, ended when a young man was charged with having had sex with a child a few days after turning 18.
"Why did he exit the system in worse circumstances than when he entered it?" the mother asks.
"And does that happen to the children of all those in care?"
He is vocally in favour of setting up an institution that would allow the Ministry of Health and Services to monitor children during the first weeks after they were taken into custody before moving to their homes.
This would enable them to better understand how children interact with others and the risks and needs associated with them, especially educationally.
The state government is looking for new ways to reduce the need for children to be placed in home care, including by seeking to better support their parents.
The purpose of the targeted aid packages, funded over a four-year period by $62 million, is to help transfer children from home care to better managed situations.
In addition, the $5.6 million two-year experiment, which was made public last October, allows professional carers to be offered to at least 28 children to help them get out of the care or avoid getting caught up in it.
According to a spokesperson for the department, the leak was not officially reported when it happened, although the mother claims to have informed two employees of the department within a few months of the incident.
The department is now working with the service provider to analyze the case.
"Every alleged private data leak is taken very seriously, and we are working to ensure that it has not adversely affected the young people concerned."
In July last year, Jenny Mikakos, the Minister for Families and Children, ordered an independent review of a sample of privacy incidents in child protection during the five-year period.
The Department accepted the seven recommendations made as a result, and has since updated the Child Protection Guide to ensure that staff clearly understands their roles and privacy-related activities, changed IT systems to prohibit the automatic aggregation of certain personal data, and officially reviewed the Department's privacy-related functions.
Australian Bank Commonwealth Bank charged with extensive money laundering violations
The Australian government filed charges against the country's largest mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank, on Thursday, for large-scale violations of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing rules.
The financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC made public that they had initiated civil punishment proceedings against CommBank in federal court due to "serious and systematic non-compliance" in Australia's largest case of their own and the first such where a large bank is accused.
"CommBank's conduct in this matter has left Australian society unprotected against serious and enduring financial crime," said AUSTRAC in a court document.
Commonwealth Bank said in their statement that they would investigate the allegations more closely and respond, "when the time is right".
Australia's largest mortgage borrower did not report "at the right time or not at all" suspicious circumstances, "concerning transactions for a total of over 77 million Australian dollars (US$61 million)," reported AUSTRAC.
According to the Agency, the Bank has committed 53 700 violations of the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing act, in particular with regard to so-called 'smart deposit machines'.
The previous largest case of this type involved Tabcorp Holdings, the most popular betting agent in Australia earlier that year, with only 108 alleged violations.
Tabcorp paid $45 million in fines and is the largest civilian penalty in Australian corporate history.
A spokesman for AUSTRAC refused to comment on CommBank's possible punishment or whether there might be other banks in the agency's line of fire.
The maximum penalty for a violation of the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing law is $18 million per violation.
Intelligent ATMs are specific types of ATMs that accept deposits in both cash and cheque form and facilitate anonymous cash deposits.
According to AUSTRAC, the use of CommBank intelligent deposit machines has increased significantly since their deployment in May 2012.
Cash deposits reached Australian$5.8 billion in the six months prior to June 2016, compared to Australian$89 million in the first six months after CommBank introduced ATMs.
AUSTRAC claims in court documents that cash deposits were made from fake names, so the proceeds came from drug-importing syndicates.
"Even after CommBank's attention was drawn to suspected money laundering or 'smurfing' on Commbank accounts, CommBank did not start monitoring its clients to complicate and manage money laundering and terrorist financing," court records indicate.
AUSTRAC added that the CommBank accounts were also used for "cuckoo surfing." This is a form of money laundering involving transfers between countries without the money actually having to cross international borders.
Nordea and DNB will be a reality at the end of the year
The merger of DNB and Nordea into a financial group called Luminor of the Baltic units will only take place in the last quarter of this year, says Äripäev.
The opening of doors in a common legal body is increasingly delayed.
Following the disclosure of the merger plans last summer, the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter.
In April, however, the DNB's communications manager said that the matter would be pushed to the third quarter.
In particular, the Swedish Financial Supervision Authority gave further instructions to Luminor in view of the regional importance of the Verbundbank.
Trump called New Hampshire it "narkourka", thus infuriating state politicians
"The president is wrong," said New Hampshire i Republican Governor Chris Sununu.
Disappointingly, his misdescription of the epidemic ignores all the great things the state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat of New Hampshire, called the remarks "disgusting" and said on Twitter that her state is no different from others struggling with widespread opioid misuse.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, also a Democrat, agreed.
"It is totally unacceptable for the president to talk about NH in this way," he wrote on Twitter.
It's an entirely false depiction of the NH and the epidemic.
Opioid addiction - a category of drugs that includes heroin and fentanyl - is the most deadly drug epidemic in American history.
An overdose of drugs killed more people in 2016 than guns or car accidents - an estimated 59,000 based on data analyzed by The New York Times - and is now the main cause of death for Americans under the age of 50.
In 2015, according to the Office for Substance Abuse and Mental Health, more than 97 million people in the United States consumed prescription painkillers.
An estimated 12 million of these people did so in a way that had not been prescribed by a physician.
New Hampshire has received a hard blow and its residents repeatedly raised the problem for presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign.
In New Hampshire, there were an estimated 470 overdose-related deaths in 2016, compared to 439 cases in 2015.
In 2012, there were 163 of them according to statistics from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Service.
On Thursday, Sununu described the opioid epidemic in an email as "one of the worst health crises the state has ever faced".
He said the government has doubled resources dedicated to prevention, treatment and recovery.
According to him, the state has also spent millions of dollars on prevention programmes aimed at children, law enforcement to end drug trafficking, and initiatives aimed at making naloxone more accessible, which is used to treat overdoses.
Call to find drivers in connection with two rapes of a girl in Witton
Police are trying to locate two drivers in connection with an investigation into the rape of a 14-year-old girl.
The teenager was attacked in the Witton area of Birmingham on July 26 at around 2:00 p.m. (BST).
Prior to this attack, he was raped at Witton Station.
In the first case, one man has been charged.
The British Transport Police would like to speak with two drivers as part of the investigation.
According to police, the first car is a brightly colored sedan.
Detective-Chief Inspector Tony Fitzpatrick said, "We have reason to believe that the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim at the station before another person picked him up and then raped him in the car.
We would like to know what was said during this conversation. Moreover, the leader may know important details that would help us in our investigation."
The driver of the second vehicle, which was red VW Sharan, according to police, probably took the victim home after being raped a second time.
This weekend, rainy appearances are promised, so it would be a good time for a proper exercise.

Still busy, trying to get other people to act quickly.
Why don't you forget your troubles and hit the field trip with your boyfriend?
Take time for yourself to enjoy each other's company in some cozy, romantic place.
Talking on a fascinating subject, you go on fire, make big plans, maybe make promises... that you'll forget a moment later.

Why do dogs eat grass?
It is sometimes thought that a dog eats grass when he is not feeling well and wants to make himself vomit.
In fact, most grass - eating dogs are perfectly healthy.
Only less than 10 percent of dogs that eat grass do it because of a disease.
One reason why a dog may suddenly start eating grass may be a poor diet.
Dogs with worms may also become more interested in chewing grass.
Thus, if a dog that has not chewed grass has developed a sudden appetite for grass and eats it often, it is worth checking with a doctor just in case, for example, to quickly detect a possible problem with the digestive system.
It is worth mentioning that a dog can also eat grass because it likes its taste or is just bored.
If a health problem is excluded, it is worth making sure that the family’s favorite can still get enough developmental and moody activities.
From the West thunder clouds come to Estonia.
There have already been thunders and few flashes in Northern Estonia.
This afternoon, the weather service also issued a thunderstorm warning.
Today there are mainly thunderstorms in Northern Estonia.
The thunder clouds move rapidly from west to east.
"The southwestern wind outbreaks range inland to 15, on islands and coasts at 18 m/s, but thunder may be accompanied by stronger winds", stands on the Weather Service website.
However, a larger thunderstorm is raging in southeastern Finland and Russia east of St. Petersburg.
Fortunately, the winds in Estonia are blowing from the west and south-west, so at least for the time being, there is no danger of major storms turning on Estonia.
Sylvester Stallone performs a guest role in the second season of "Our Lives"
Lead producer Dan Fogelman announced on Thursday on a press tour of the Television Critics Association as part of a forum regarding the series that Sylvester Stallone would be stepping up in the upcoming second season of NBC's popular drama series.
The actor performs as a guest in Kevin (Justin Hartley)'s co-star role in the film shoots at the beginning of the season.
"Kevin is playing in a big movie and we needed a big co-star," Fogelman said.
At the end of last season, Kevin was hired to play an important role in a short-lived Ron Howard stage film from the series.
This season we see the character participates in the project and also warms up relationships with his ex, who is played by Alexandra Breckenridge.
According to Fogelman, Stallone plays a father figure in "the film Kevin is involved in".
"Our Life" star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Hartley's father in the series' past pictures, played the son of Stallone in the 2006 film Rocky Balboa as a coincidence.
Fogelman said that Ventimiglia's still flourishing friendship with Stallone was probably what helped attract a big star in the series as a guest actor.
"We have a great scenario for him.
I believe it will be truly exciting," Fogelman said.
"'Our Life' returns to TV screens on September 26".
In the United States, after a national hunt, two staff members of elite universities were arrested.
42-year-old Northwestern professor Wyndham Lathem turned himself in to the police in California after police had sought him out.
Andrew Warren, a 56-year-old Oxford University employee, was caught by police officers in San Francisco.
"Men suspected of brutal stabbing of 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau".
He was found dead in Lathem's apartment in Chicago at the end of last month.
A few days later, suspects made a large donation in cash under the name of the deceased to a library.
Before turning himself in to police, Latham sent a video to friends and family members, according to an employee of the Chicago Police Department, about the biggest mistake of his life.
CNN didn't see the video and the police won't release it.
According to police, it was a brutal murder and his body had been transformed by wounds.
Warren had recently arrived in Chicago from Britain, but investigators have so far not determined whether and how he was familiar with the victim.
Before being arrested, both suspects fled the state.
Elise Christie is talking about how she got over Sochi's horrors and cyberbullying to skate again for gold.
Compared to this fragile young woman who recently considered saying goodbye to the skating stadium forever, 26-year-old Christie has changed beyond recognition.
Wicked insults knocked him down, especially since he was also bullied when he was a child in West Lothian school.
At this point, he is feeling confident and believes that the ordeal can circle back to the starting point, bringing at least one gold in Pyeongchang with him.
"Undoubtedly, I wish to exit as an Olympic winner," he says, without fearing the goal to be specified.
"I feel that I am at the right point, both physically and mentally, to deal with it."
She once dreamed of a figure skating career until aesthetic elements began to diminish this interest.
"I was a very skilful jumper, but I had trouble with the art-seeking side of the matter," he said, laughing.
"I wasn't very good at elegance, orderlyness.
It was a sensible choice because short-track skating suits my personality best."
A woman walks around the world on foot: My daily budget is $5!
To be honest, I've had this experience myself, for 40 days, where I decided to live a life of "foolish" in the south of France, just to be free and live a day at a time.
Got overnight in tents, woods, small town stations, etc.
In the second week, I joined a Frenchman's "homeless", a 44-year-old man was..
Oh, don't think of any queer tendencies or anything like that: We just stayed in the same park in Mentone and became friends, although he was 15 years older than me, he was good company.
Turns out he's from a good family, Paris, a former French Navy officer.
No alcohol, no malice, no decent person, intelligent, pleasant communicator, seen life.
In a word, I joined him, and for the next three weeks we wandered together, from town to city, and also about 5€ a day with food money.
The money came so much that you'd live.
The man taught how to provide help in the evenings on the terraces of closed hotels and restaurants and on the roadside farms.
We worked exactly enough to have food money for the next two or three days, and then...
At some point, I caught a fever and decided I couldn't...
I took a flight to Helsinki, home from there.
And by the way, I still regret it.
I guess those 40 days were the best days of my life.
In Indonesia, a man who stole three audio amplifiers from a mosque was burned alive, brokered by the Hungarian news agency MTI.
A 30-year-old thief snuck out of the Mosque of the city of Bekas near the capital Jakarta with sound amplifiers on August 1, but was spotted by a shrine guard and shouted, "Get the thief!"
They came to help, and they immediately pursued the thief.
He escaped on a motorcycle and even swam across the river.
The chase lasted a few kilometers, then hit one of the chasers' hurled rocks on the chased head, inflicting a serious injury.
An angry mob of chasers caught the thief and beat him up.
One chaser poured gasoline over the thief and set him on fire.
The innocent died of burns at the scene.
The body was delivered to a police hospital in East Jakarta.
Police took possession of both the dead motorcycle and the stolen sound amplifiers.
At first, reports appeared in the local press that it was not a thief, but an electric montor who said he wanted to repair the stereo amplifiers.
The police, however, decidedly refuted these allegations.
The relatives of the deceased reported that they would not make a statement about what had happened.
According to the German news agency dpa, the reason for this move is the fact that the Indonesians have little trust in the police or judicial authorities.
Indonesia is the largest Islamic country in the world.
Of the 255 million inhabitants, as many as 87.2% are Muslim.
Australian cuisine: from finger slot to schoolyard.
Indigenous Aborigines, modern - day Australian cuisine has inherited finger lime and kangaroo meat.
British roots have also influenced the food table there much - for example, the Vegemite, a dark brown salty beer yeast spread with butter on bread or cracker, resembles the British Marmite.
Meat pies, or meat pies, which are served with boiled potatoes and sauce, also come from the British.
There are also UK-born BBQ Snags, or raw sausages, which are baked by Australians on grills, while the British are more of an oven.
One of the local sweet stars is the Pavlova beseetort, although it is also called its invention by New Zealanders.
The sweets also love coconut and oatmeal crisp Anzac biscuits and coconut-cheese-coated cupcakes called lamingtons.
Honey Joys, or Bear Joys, are called honey cornflakes.
Australian Cooking Celebrity Stephanie Alexander and her life's work, the kitchen Bible of domestic chefs "Cookmate", which is at least half a million Australian homes. / Blake Storey, Prime Creative Media
In the fall of this year, Stephanie celebrates her 77th birthday.
His father was a public official, and his mother Mary loved food very much.
Stephanie studied librarianship at the university and, as Australian youths do, she went on to discover Europe after her studies.
While traveling in France, Stephanie’s food love only became established and developed.
In London, however, she met her first husband, Jamaican roots Monty, with whom they opened a simple dining place at The Jamaican House in Melbourne in 1964.
A decade later, the marriage dissolved and the restaurant closed its doors.
In 1976, he opened the restaurant Stephanie's Restaurant for a slightly more prosperous nation, one of Melbourne's most prized dining venues for the next 21 years.
A prominent restaurant is still spoken of as the first fine dining restaurant in Melbourne, which really knew how to value fresh raw materials and provided seasonal food - a fact that now seems like the truth of the abbits, but it was not yet at the end of the last century.
Since retiring from the restaurant business in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing cookbooks; 15 of them have appeared from her pen.
There are even more productive food writers in Estonia, but in his case, no book has been just a recipe collection.
For Australian home chefs, different Stephanie Alexander cookbooks have been irreplaceable.
For her life's work, however, the lady holds the fifth cookbook, the most popular "The Cook's Companion", which is now at least half a million Australian homes.
The book was first released in 1996, supplemented with a release in 2004, and the latest version in 2014.
It takes a lot of space in my bookcase in the release of 2004 because there are about a thousand recipes in an imposcent book on 1126 pages!
However, the latest option is even more substantial.

This is a true cookery Bible, which, in addition to recipes, deals with the purchase and storage of various raw materials, introduces cooking technologies and makes recommendations for the purchase of kitchen utensils.
Food is in alphabetical order, and there are also many cross-references in the work - obviously the education of the library did not run off the side of the food writer.
Stephanie herself emphasizes that it was this book that changed her life and gave future activities a new direction.
The popular feeling that he has something to give to people led to the next major kitchen garden project, which in our circumstances is comparable to school gardens.
The fourth Estonian person received a heart in Finland.
According to doctors at the Northern Estonian Regional Hospital (PERH), cardiosurgeon Günter Taal and cardiologist Pentti Põdra, who participated in the surgery together with the Finnish medics, the post-operative period has been as expected.
"It's very hard to say how long a patient could have lived without a new heart", said Moose.
According to doctors, the world has now lived with a heart pump for a maximum of eight years.
The man himself is still recovering and is not ready to discuss the matter.
He was first diagnosed with heart failure two years ago, and the disease had already reached an end-stage, the heart failure being caused by ischemic disease.
"For this patient, the transplant was the only option", Taal added.
According to a cardiosurgeon, the patient has no batteries or wires attached to the heart pump after the transplant.
All he'll have left is a scar and an immunity suppressant drug.
The patient can exercise and generally lives on as an ordinary person", he said.
First year is the most dangerous.
The moose added that a full recovery would take three to six months.
According to both doctors, the patient should be strictly monitored on a regular basis; however, the medicines also have side effects.
In addition, the patient should be monitored to avoid rejection of the donor organ.
The most dangerous is the first year, but according to ISHLT, or International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, 50 percent of patients live for more than ten years.
He said that Helsinki had better results and that the longest time lived with a heart transplant was 25 years.
A cardiosurgeon explained that because of the disease, the patient’s circulation was poor, a heart pump was put on him a year ago, which helped him to recover from surgery.
When the man's pulmonary artery pressure dropped, he became a suitable candidate for transplant.
According to Taal, the transplant operation is not considered to be a very complicated operation: timing is very important.
"It took a lot more time to get the pump and then get the heart when you put the new heart in", he said.
In addition, as a complex part of the surgery, the cardiosurgeon brought out the withdrawal from the bloodstream outside the body.
Rather, he said that heart transplants can be considered extraordinary because Estonians need it least.
Kidney, liver and lung transplantations are more common.
There's still excitement in rare surgery, but we've been practicing this work for many years.
Getting to know yourself and your own nervous system is an art in this profession", Taal added.
Four more people need the organ.
According to Taal, the patient received a heart because none of the other patients living in the Community of Scandiatranspland were fit for an organ.
Scandiatransplant is an organisation for organ exchange with Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia as members.
There are currently four more people on the heart transplant list in Estonia.
"They're still counted patients", Moose stressed.
Taal says that big men with a 0-positive blood type wait the longest time.
"In Finland, there is a queue for it for about half a year", he stated.
There's a lot of conditions to get a heart.
"A woman's heart usually doesn't fit a man, a big person's heart for a small and so on", a cardiosurgeon listed.
How to finance company vehicles?
In a changed consumption society, vehicle financing opportunities for companies have expanded – in addition to the usual practice, more and more companies are also using full service leases or longer-term car rentals.
Renting and renting a vehicle are two distinctly different financial transactions involving different obligations and expectations, but often confusing.
According to Villi Tõld, the sales and marketing manager of the international car rental company AVIS Eesti, it is evident that companies are increasingly moving towards full service leasing and the possibility of long-term rental is increasingly being used.
The carriage highlighted the main questions to which it is possible to choose a suitable way of using the vehicle when looking for answers.
How long to use the vehicle?
The biggest difference between car rental and leasing is the time of use.
"It is worth preferring leasing for a longer-term vehicle to be used if the company has a plan to use commercial vehicles for a longer period", Tõld explained, adding that it is worth deciding in favour of the standardisation if you want to own a vehicle, in favour of full service leasing or long-term rental, if the vehicle is to be used as a service, i.e. a car on a daily basis, but leaving maintenance obligations to the service provider and so-called giving up ownership.
"The rental car has a much shorter period of use than the leasing period, but many of the major car rental companies also offer long-term car rentals, where the car rental takes place without complicated contracts and with free return", Tõld introduced various car rental options.
Who will be the owner of the vehicle?
At the end of the standardization, the tenant becomes the owner of the car.
"In the case of full service leases, it is possible to continue with the lease payment on the same or better terms at the end of the lease period, by replacing the same new vehicle that meets the needs of the company", he said, stressing that as the consumer society is increasingly moving towards service-oriented consumption, it is an additional obligation for the company to have the vehicle.
In addition, in a full service lease, you can also buy a car for yourself on the basis of your wish and agreed terms.
However, this option is not available and will only be paid for the period of use.
Car rental usually takes place at car company offices and hire of a car from the rental office of rental companies.
Car company agencies primarily sell vehicles, but also offer leasing opportunities and in some cases car rental.
However, rental companies have cars for the sole purpose of renting them out.
Tõld said that the reasons for using the rental service are different – many companies rent professional vehicles, in addition, it is convenient to use the service when travelling or on holiday or when their own car is in repair.
"In the case of official vehicles, there is an increasing transition to full service leasing, which provides customer with cost transparency, time savings in the purchase, use and return process of vehicles, and greater comfort", the sales and marketing manager introduced the growing leasing trend.
Every year more and more companies use full service leases for their car fleets, thus optimising their spending and focusing on their core business.
What is the coverage of service-based insurance?
In the case of a leased car, the rental car is usually covered by basic insurance and it is also necessary to decide whether to include, for example, emergency insurance, theft insurance or full insurance. "However, if you compare the standardisation with full service leasing, the customer will receive more at the same monthly payment, as the monthly payment will cover not only the vehicle and insurance but also the regular maintenance of cars, 24-hour assistance, tyre changes and other agreed services", Tõld explained.
"If any new vehicle can be admitted to the standard, in the case of full service leasing, the service provider will help to choose a vehicle that meets the wishes and needs of the company, which also takes into account the functions of use", he compared, stressing that full service leasing will certainly help to optimise the costs of the company's car fleets.
"However, the choice of rental vehicles depends on the service provider's rental car park - different rental companies offer both a small and economical vehicle for use in urban traffic and a luxurious sedanini for business meetings", Tõld described.
During a tight rental period, of course, it may happen that the desired car has already been rented out, but against this helps the desired vehicle to be booked in advance early.
When choosing between leasing or rental, you should first clarify your goals - how long is the desire to use the vehicle and what are long-term plans for the car.
It is certainly worth carefully examining the different conditions and obligations of the services.
At a press conference yesterday, Member of the Riigikogu who joined Edgar Savisaare’s electoral alliance Olga Ivanova said that the electoral union named Savisaare offers the Centre Party a healthy competition in Tallinn in the autumn elections.
However, how likely does Edgar Savisaar consider co-operation with the Urmas Sõõrumaa Electoral Union "Tegus Tallinn" to be?
A United States Navy veteran was ordered to remove a wrapper depicting the American flag from the mailbox
Retired United States veteran and Florida homeowners union at the heart of the festering dispute is a mailbox covered by the American flag.
Retired United States Navy officer John Ackert says he received a letter last week from the Tallahassee Southwood Housing Community Union asking him to remove the State Flag depicting the wrapper from the mailbox or face punishment.
He told WCTV that he was not going to give up without a fight and has filed an appeal.
"I view this honestly as bullying," Ackert said.
And I think people should fight bullying in whatever form, especially one of these.
Ackert said that the homeowners union claimed his mailbox was not consistent with Southwood's aesthetic values.
United States Navy veteran John Ackert said that he was ordered to remove a wrapper depicting the American flag covering his mailbox.
"Because of the approach of the end of the holiday season, we ask you to remove the wrapper depicting the American flag from the mailbox," the letter passed.
The decorations can be out 30 days before and must be taken out within 15 days at the latest.
He said the wrapper's been out for four years.
It was placed there 30 days after moving into the house.
Messages to the Southwood Housing Community Union received no immediate response on Thursday morning.
Some of Ackert's neighbors told WCTV the letter was a bit harsh, and were not particularly surprised by the actions of the homeowners' union.
"They do things like this all the time," Mike Stephenson said.
I think it's ridiculous.
Why shouldn't you be patriotic in your country?
Mike Patel said, "It's about a veteran who served our country.
It's just a mailbox with a flag.
I don't think that's right.
He owns the house, at least he can afford it.
A letter from the Homeowners' Association states that Ackert has 15 days to remove the wrapper, otherwise he will be fined.
He has not received an answer to his appeal.
Vietnam 'repents' over German kidnapping charge
Vietnam said on Thursday that it regrets the comments made by the German Foreign Ministry accusing the Vietnamese intelligence service of kidnapping a former Vietnamese oil company wanted at home due to embezzlement charges.
German authorities believe that Trinh Xuan Thanh was grabbed from Berlin, which left 48 hours for Vietnamese intelligence attachés on Wednesday to leave the country.
Thanh faces embezzlement charges involving the death penalty in the event of conviction.
He sought asylum in Germany, but his statement had not yet been processed when the Vietnamese authorities demanded his extradition.
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman Le Thi Thu Hang told reporters that these comments were "extremely regrettable" and Thanh turned himself in to police in Vietnam on July 31.
"Vietnam always considers it important and wishes to develop strategic relations with Germany," he said without going into the details.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July of last year after being initially charged with unfair management in the PetroVietnam subsidiary of the national oil and gas giant, which resulted in approximately US$150 million in losses.
Vietnamese police issued an arrest warrant in September.
In March, police launched an investigation into the acquisition in connection with his alleged involvement in a real estate development project.
Thanh was chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed to several senior positions in the government, including Hau Giang Province as deputy chairman in the southern Mekong Delta.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was acquitted of the Communist premier legislative body before its first sitting in the month following.
He was also expelled from the Communist Party.
The Vietnamese ambassador to Germany was called to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and was informed that Germany would demand the return of Thanh so that asylum and extradition procedures could be properly executed.
The bus driver rescued eight puppies from the side of the driveway, not knowing that dogs actually had an owner.
"Where am I going to put those eight puppies, I would have been thrown out of the apartment by a woman with dogs", joked bus driver Oleg, who rescued the puppies who were unattended by the driveway, handing them over to the shelter worker.
Soon, however, the owner of the dogs showed up at the shelter, for whom it was unclear why the puppies were taken away from his home.
The bus driver in Harjumaa, Oleg, said that he had been working as a bus driver since the early 1990s, but this has not occurred before in his career."I took the bus number 146 to my usual route.
Near the Harju Cross, I noticed something small running around the side of the road.
I thought it was a raccoon, but it turned out to be four puppies", recalled the bus driver.
Oleg had a heart attack, and he stopped a bus full of passengers to pick up the puppies.
"Unfortunately, the cars would have run them over and crushed the dogs", Oleg said.
He added that the passengers were reasonable, and the soft dog children were also a source of great joy.
The puppies were a little scared at first, but then you got fun.
Puppies on board, the bus driver went on a new lap because the driving schedule needed to be followed.
As he drove past the puppy's find, he saw four other little dogs there.
They were German Shepherd puppies.
They were so fluffy, and they were immediately taken care of.
The dogs were beautiful. They were amazing.
The first thought, of course, was that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason", the driver said that for this reason he decided to carry the puppies to the bus.
"I picked up those four puppies and called the police too", Oleg recalled.
The lawkeepers contacted the Tallinn Animal Shelter, whose staff came to the Baltic Station for their puppies.
But wasn't the bus driver tempted to take the hairballs?
That was the idea.
One dog boy was so beautiful and calm.
Sitting beautifully like a grown dog", Oleg said.
But where do I put these eight puppies?
My wife and dogs would have thrown me out of the apartment.
We still have a little kid.
Early to take the dog", he added.
Eve Tobias, the head of the Tallinn Animal Shelter, confirmed that 8 German Shepherd puppies, two and a half months old, were brought to the shelter.
But that same day, the owner came to pick up the puppy family.
"We didn't even form these puppies and just give them back", he remarked.
"The dog owner was not very upset, but he did say they had the only house in sight and the bus driver could have come to ask if the puppies belonged to them", Tobias said.
However, the manager of the shelter added that it is also good that the bus driver picked up the brats that were raging along the road and therefore did not have an accident.
In fact, it was very good of the bus driver to react!
Jordanian court enforced life sentence for killing three United States military personnel
Jordan's military appeals court sentenced Jordanian soldier last year to life sentences for shooting three United States military trainers.
The war tribunal last month sentenced Senior Sergeant Marik al-Tuwayha to a life sentence with hard work at the entrance to South Jordan Air Base for killing Americans.
Al-Tuwayha opened fire on an American caravan, claiming he feared an attack on the base.
However, a security camera video released after the decision revealed that he continued shooting even when two Americans shadowed and waved their hands to stop shooting.
News site Hala Akhbar, linked to the Jordanian military, announced Thursday that a military appeal court with five judges upheld al-Tuwayha's sentence.
James Harrison spends about $300,000 a year to keep his body in a form of play
Each player in the NFL depends on their body for a living.
As a result, many other athletes also invest a great deal of money in the maintenance and restoration of the body in order to remain in top form.
Jeremy Fowler from the portal ESPN.com explored more closely how far some veterans are willing to go to extend their careers.
However, no case is as extreme as that of 39-year-old James Harrison, a Pittsburgh Steelers rear defensive line player preparing for season 14.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends $300,000 a year on acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractors, and cupcakes.
Most of the expenses are related to travelling across the country to meet specialists.
"I don't have to keep records of such things," Harrison said.
"If you compare the amounts earned with my spending, the payouts are worth it, given how I feel."
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and teammate at Steelers, estimated the annual cost of caring for his body at $200,000.
30-year-old Mitchell has tested body relaxation (English for "body tempering"), which Fowler described as "the use of 55 kilos of metal as a massage scroll".
"Instead of rolling on it, it will be rolled on you," Mitchell said.
"If you have a tight spot on your leg and they start moving this thing around, it's painful at times.
But when you get up, the pressure will be gone.
It just beats the tension out."
They're willing to make an extra effort, but former NFL players Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris spend an average of $50,000 a year on recovery.
Cofield, who played 10 seasons in the ranks of the New York Giants and Washington Redskins, has expressed regret that he did not spend more.
"If I could go back, I would invest even more," Cofield told Fowler.
"I'd probably give at least twice as much.
I was in very good health for the first eight years of my career.
Towards the end, more procedures might have helped."
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old rear defensive line player, expressed his willingness to step in the footsteps of his veteran Steelers teammates.
"If you pay $100,000 and you earn an additional three million by playing, this decision is quite simple," Shazier said.
In terms of career longevity, investing in player recovery is far more clever than spending money on cars and villas.
The average NFL player lucky to be able to play more than 30 years old, the more Harrison's success should convince his colleagues to shift their spending to a different location.
But maybe they can just find a local specialist.
Weekend Festival Baltic boss Gunnar Viese tells Õhtuleht that the festival first came from Finland years ago and its owners visited the beach strip near Riga for expansion, but on their way back they stopped in Pärnu and sold the festival to Estonia.
Gunnar says that they have targeted 25,000 visitors a day, but chicks are only counted when the festival is over.
Preparations for this year’s party began last September.
"We had information from the city that construction would begin on the last site, there would be a hotel", says Gunnar, about the change they had to face this year.
You don't see any knocks in there right now, but you think if the knock didn't go to the ground this year, the next one will.
So maybe we should have moved out sometime", he explains why the festival area has moved this year.
The festival arrangement goes all year round.
People work on the Weekend between a thousand and a half thousand in total - police officers, organizing crews, volunteers, traders, security personnel and so on.
The hardest thing, according to Viese, was for Weekend to get the duo The Chainsmokers to perform.
After all, men are now the undisputed number one in the pop music world.
Why it was hard to get The Chainsmokers to the Weekend and how Gunnar comments that the two artists canceled their performances, watch already in the video.
The bike in response to Ansip: we have done a lot for Estonia's success.
European Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip said in an interview to Chronicle that he is sad to see Estonia’s daily policy, as the government of Jüri Ratas has turned the simple and predictable tax system upside down.
You took the opportunity in Chronicle magazine to ask me what I have done for Estonia’s success and what I can be proud of.
I am pleased that we have made many important decisions in the government as a good team and in the months we have read, many of which have been expected in Estonia for more than a decade", Ratas wrote on social media today.
Ratas said that these decisions are, for example, an income tax reform for raising people's income, a pension reform for ensuring a dignified retirement for the elderly, a local government reform for balancing Estonia's development, an increase in agricultural subsidies for revitalizing rural areas and, of course, a health care reform for providing accessible and high quality medical care.
"I wish you a good vacation!" wrote the Wheel in his address to Ansip.
Talents on Pärnu Weekend: A drunk man has fallen asleep in a strange car
Last night at 3:00 p.m., policemen received a somewhat different challenge.
One of the owners of the Audi reported that a strange man had climbed into his car and fallen asleep at a gas station near Port Artur.
The patrol, responding to the event, found a man who woke himself up when the lawkeepers arrived.
In fact, he was tired for a moment on his journey and found a place in the back seat of a stranger’s car.
"The man, after the alarm of the lawkeepers, set out on his own on his way home again", describes West Prefecture on Facebook.
A good ending, all good!

The heart of the Locarno Film Festival will be midfielder Piazza Grande, or Big Square, from August 2-12.
Many premieres will take place within the framework of the festival, which will be presented by well-known directors and casts.
When the evening fades, you have to redeem a ticket worth 15-20 euros to enjoy one film.
Pula Film Festival at the Roman Amphitheatre, Croatia
Gladiators, blood, a screaming crowd, a muddy arena - such a picture opened 2000 years ago in the Pula amphitheater in Croatia, where the international audience now enjoys films on the summer night of July.
For the first time, an outdoor screen was set up in a Roman building in 1953, making Pula a film festival one of the oldest outdoor cinemas in Europe.
Under the starry sky, good films have been enjoyed by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, John Malkovich and Ben Kingsley.
The price is symbolic: an evening in the Mediterranean with high-quality films means going out of €3.
Sala Montjuïci open-air cinema, Spain
Next to the film, Sala Montjuïci offers a wonderful view of the open-air cinema.
It operates on Mount Montjuïc, or the Jewish mountain above Barcelona.
In the dark of the evening in southern Europe, the moat of the fortress stands out throughout Barcelona, which is an attraction in its own right.
The organizers of the moat sopp erect a large screen by July, where the well-known films from "La La Land" to "Manhattan" in 1979 will be shown.
At the same time, the cinema accommodates up to 2,500 people and you have to pay 6.50 euros for the entrance.

Cinema Under the Stars, Italy
The true breath of nostalgic Italy can be experienced in the central square of Bologna, where the restored pearls of the local film archive are shown on summer evenings.
Next to the tenth largest church in the world, the San Petronio Basilica, there are 3,000-5,000 people who can watch old films.
The buildings of northern Italy, mostly during the Enlightenment of the 15th century, together with the warmth and good company of the summer evening, create a romantic atmosphere in which every crisp northerner melts.

The stupidest questions to ask a bartender.
The Huffington Post mediates questions that have come to the attention of bartenders, which they would rather not hear.
What kind of drink do you make best?
Some drinks do have more ingredients than others, but they require the same skills and skill.
Often, bar attendants interpret this question as "What is the easiest/fastest thing for you to do right now?", which signals them that a client does not care what he drinks, whether or not making it difficult for a bartender to do it.
What kind of drink do you like best?
This question is interpreted in the same way, which cocktail would be the easiest thing to get from a bartender right now.
It's not for the bartender to say, it's for the client to make his own decisions based on the thickness of his wallet.
Rather, bartenders would be waiting for the question of whether there are any special offers at the moment.
What's good here?
Perhaps this question is motivated by a heartfelt desire to know whether the bar stands out as offerings, but it could also be asked otherwise.
Nor does a bartender know in advance what the customer might prefer.
Can I have a drink that's not very sweet?
Here, like the previous rule, the bartender is not familiar with your taste and preferences and what is sweet for one may not be sweet for others.
But he is willing to listen to what flavors the desired cocktail might contain.
Does this drink give me a headache/hangover?
The bartender is not a medic or a fortune teller, so he knows how to afford it to the client, with a hand on his heart.
The cold summer has driven Estonians to travel abroad so much that package trips are not only expensive but sold out regardless of price.
Even cheap airline tickets and last-minute tickets would not be worth hoping for; it would be wiser to think about next year’s travel plans instead.
The man has taken the model hostage with a plan to sell him in the dark web.
A Polish citizen took a British model hostage in Italy.
The man had plans to auction a 20-year-old woman in a dark web, or encrypted online, reported the Guardian.
According to police reports, the woman was lured to Milan by July 11 with the promise that she would get a job in a photo shoot.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
The captors allegedly tried to sell the woman for £230,000 in the dark web and filed a ransom claim with her model agency.
However, the woman's captor took her to the British consulate on 17 July.
According to police, the suspect is the Polish citizen Lukasz Herba, who lives in Britain.
According to Corriere della Sera, the newspaper, the man discovered that the kidnapped woman had a young child and did not want to sell her to a sex slave.
People are attracted to such trials.
It would be a good thing to keep thinking and drawing conclusions.
The suggestion to spend a little more time studying the background of those who want to be friends is obvious.
More generally, however, everyone could have a strategy that they share about themselves on social media.
At national level, however, we need to ask whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the threats on social media.
The lives of false persons created under controlled conditions ended in summer school, but the lives of the native wretches certainly did not.
Every now and then, you have to go to the woods for whatever reason.
But if coldness gets under your skin, it's time to have a hot tea drink.
There are sufficient resources in the forest for this.
Defense Home! makes a little review.
We are talking about tea drinks because coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which has some exhilarating effect, but is not very good for our health.
When using plants found in the wild, you must always be prepared for testing because both recipes and tastes are different.
Some plants do not need to be boiled for long, but it is enough to pour hot water on them; others, on the other hand, must be left to draw for hours.
Of course, we also need to be mindful that water and plants are clean enough.
Also, much depends on the time and place of harvest.
Let us take a closer look at how to prepare a simple cup of tea, and what effect these can have on us.
Pine wattle
Pine rinks can drink peacefully all year round.
If it is good to drink 2 liters of water per day, then this tea is suitable to satisfy the need for vitamin C and, in addition, to provide some extra energy.
As with all plants, it is possible to extract useful elements from pine needles using alternative methods, such as crushing - thorns do not have to be boiled for long, it is enough to wake up with hot water and stop pulling for a few hours.
It takes 0.4 litres per litre of water, which must be boiled for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink containing nearly 25 mg of vitamin C, a lot of potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 sugar cubes or about 20 kcal of sugar.
You can always add lemon and honey to the pine leaves to improve your taste.
And if the drink became very strong, it could be diluted with water like syrup.
Making spruce occasion is the same, but the drink itself tastes a little different.
The Raspberry drink is excellent and helps with a great deal of problems, from rheumatism to pimples.
Raspberry helps to overcome fatigue, is pain-relieving and helps with colds both as a cough reliever and as a lower fever reliever.
As a result, it would not be worth more than half a litre a day.
The raspberry drink also makes you sweat, so in winter you should find a more peaceful moment to enjoy it.
To make a drink in winter, take fresh raspberries, and in summertime use leaves, shoots or berries.
A half - liter drink requires a small bundle of branches of right length, which must be boiled until the water acquires a reddish tone.
You can also make an image of Raspberry stalks.
To do this, break the stems and keep them warm in the water for a few hours.
A longer and more thorough treatment will also make the drink stronger.
Ready-made raspberry drink can also be added to pine occasses as a flavor.
Black-bellied tarantula
Black-bellied is a tree fungus that in nature looks like a black-burned piece on a tree.
It is mostly found on birches, but also elsewhere.
The field of use of the fungus is very wide - as a hot drink, to light a fire, instead of a incense, etc.
You can wash very well with a thousand.
Black pussies are a kind of super-drink that can be used to treat a wide range of diseases, even cancer or relieve, to enhance tone, reduce stress, prolong life.
The fungus contains a number of unique compounds and many vitamins B, as well as antioxidants and some minerals and protein.
Mushroom tea can be consumed daily and there is no risk of over-consumption.
To make a drink, about 3 x 3 cm of mushroom is sufficient, which must be boiled in 2-3 litres of water for 5-15 minutes.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited Estonia’s fourth largest island, Vormsi, today as part of a tour of the small islands, where he met with local rural municipality leaders and residents to discuss the current issues of island life.
The tour of Vormsi Island started at the port of Sviby, where Prime Minister Rata was greeted by the municipality elder Tanel Viks of Vormsi and the chairman of the municipal council Ivo Sarapuu.
The first to visit was the historic St. Olavi Church and the adjoining cemetery, which is unique in Estonia for its limestone and sandstone ring crosses.
A meeting followed with Vormsi Kindergarten-Basic School, where Principal Age Hälvin discussed with the Prime Minister the life of the school and the organisation of studies, according to which some of the school's pupils are in distance learning.
Before lunch, the Prime Minister visited the new and modern joint operational service building, which opened in 2015, and also had a meeting with the island people.
The discussion addressed issues of importance to the population, such as the development of shipping and air routes between the small islands and the mainland.
The state has committed itself to ensuring regular transport connections on settled small islands, but increasing traffic, for example during the summer period, also complicates the important journeys of local residents.
These are places where the state can take local wishes and needs into account early and in the planning process", said the Prime Minister.
In addition, the issues of the construction, education of interest, the safety of the island and the rescue capability of the small ships port were discussed.
Today's visit to Vormsi was the last part of the Prime Minister's tour of the small islands, to learn about the living environment of the islands and to discuss issues that need to be resolved with local residents and local government leaders.
In July the Head of Government visited the islands of Saaremaa, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi and Manilaidu, during August he has visited Naissaar, Prangli and Aegna.
For the first time, the Centre Party goes to elections without the founding and ideological cornerstone of the party.
So far we said the Centre Party and we were thinking about Savisaar or vice versa.
Now the Centre Party must find its way without him.
In doing so, they must also stage the party's colourful, sometimes criminal and embarrassing past, Savisaare's internal supporters and the expectations of the electorate.
The departure of Savisaar puts the Centre Party in the most difficult situation in ideological terms.
According to political practice and ideology so far, the old rhino will definitely outplay them.
Several cards that used to work as trumps may not materialize this time.
The populism map does not work for the Centre Party, because Savisaar can always afford more than the Prime Minister's Party.
Playing on the Russian card is difficult because of the Centre Party's position in the government and also because here, too, we see the so-called Savinova electoral alliance pushing the gas to the bottom.
The bearer's card is already in Savisaare's pocket due to the ongoing trial.
A map of the Popular Front and the impoverished has also been lost to the Centre Party.
The former is of little value without its creator, and the stronger play of the latter is hindered by coalition partners within the government.
However, one card may be of even greater weight.
All the last elections have confirmed that the successful parties are those who are able to formulate the fundamental conflict of the elections and then put it into practice.
The main conflict has often revolved around Savisaare.
If a political party should have the idea of inflating a well-functioning confrontation, the Centre Party's deck of cards will be once again short of a trump card.
So what's it gonna be for the Centre Party?
They still have a strong party apparatus and considerable resources.
There will also be plenty of ribbon cuttings before the election.
Four years ago, most of the shameless self-advertising with taxpayers' money has now hopefully been repaid to the citizens of Tallinn.
Tallinn's urban media is still there, but there has been less of the practice of political guerrilla journalism.
In addition, the party has vocal magnets.
Their role this time remains to bring the Castan out of the fire, because the image of the power party is not enough to motivate voters in a meaningful way.
Ideologically speaking, Jüri Ratas must find his way, as the journey with clay isolation ended this week.
In Australian waters, 3 U.S. Marines were lost in a plane crash.
The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps completed the search operation, Marine Corps Base Camp Butler reported in a statement in Japan, basically confirming that the military is no longer hoping to find the missing ones alive.
The accident occurred on a Marine Corps aircraft, the Osprey MV-22, which took off from aboard USS Bonhomme Richard.
There were 26 people on board the plane, 23 of whom managed to find and rescue.
The plane that crashed into the sea took part in joint US-Australia exercises last month in Shoalwater Bay, Queensland.
Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne said that Saturday's incident occurred off the coast of Shoalwater Bay.
The woman found a strange wedding ring in the washing machine - who could it belong to?
"I started to take the laundry out of the machine when a sparkle between the rubber seal of the washing machine struck my eye," she says, "how she found a stranger's wedding ring in her washing machine."
In fact, Karin did not flash the gloss at the door of the washing machine with his first swing.
I rebooted the machine.
"At the side of two young children, this dirty laundry immediately emerges", the woman smiles.
When the second wash was over and I started to take the laundry out, the glow in the rubber seal of the washing machine still stuck in my eye, and then I found this ring.
The gold wedding ring is engraved with the name of a married man 14 years ago - Tomi.
Since someone in the family with this name or a woman who might be married to a Tom doesn't know, the ring is a complete mystery.
Karin asked the older child if she had found the ring in her yard, put it in her pocket, and had gotten into the washing machine that way, but the child confirmed that she had not brought the ring home.
Karin and his partner have lived in the apartment on Low Street in Tallinn for a year.
They used to rent it out, and the washing machine dates back to that time.
But if the ring is supposed to have anything to do with the tenants, how did it end up in the machine?
"Now I'm uncalled for and can't tell which way the ring landed in the washing machine", the woman laughs.
Since the pace of life next to the two young children is quite fast, at first they forgot to find home on top of the closet.
"In recent times there have been posts looking for the owner of the wedding ring, and now it seemed like it was high time to look for the owner of the ring that was also found", Karin refers to a case where the wedding ring found happily last week on Puhangu Street in Tallinn.
"Since different things are found and sought on Facebook, then I thought I would try luck first there", Karin says, whose post has already been shared by nearly 4,000 people.
"Postitus has received all kinds of feedback and not everything is good", sighs the woman, pointing out that with the first comments she was advised to take her husband to the grid.
Then I felt like I needed this shit now.
That my husband has become the greatest cheater ever heard of.
To tell you the truth, I was concerned at first, but later, when I came to the comments that maybe I had been messing with the ring owner, it made me laugh.
Commentators also suggested that maybe the ring had reached the woman in a second-round garment pocket.
"Well, the last time I got a job about six months ago, she bought some other shorts that flew into the washing machine without a more thorough investigation, but did she?" she's talking to herself.
Be that as it may, my partner and I agreed that now, for the sake of principle, we have to find the ring owner.
Whatever the reason this ring is missing.
Divorce, family strife or whatever.
I think it's the right thing to do, because if I ever lost my wedding ring, I know I'd be grateful to someone who would try to find me and return valuable property.
Karin has also turned to the Civil Status Office for help in finding the owner.
However, I received the answer that in Estonia, on such a date and by such a name, the gentleman has not married.
One ring has found the owner.
Recently, the wedding ring found on 21 July in Pelguranna, Tallinn, returned happily to the owner, the engraving of which allowed it to be assumed to belong to an elderly woman.
"I walked with the dogs this morning and noticed Puhangu 53 behind the house, inside the truncated track, the golden ring", Gerli says that the engraving promised to assume that it belonged to an elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (on photo) on her Facebook page and in the group "Marked in Tallinn", shared information with the Northern Tallinn district and Northern Prefecture.
Two weeks later, the police contacted Gerl and announced that the ring bearer had been identified.
"I made contact with the owner's daughter and on Monday night the find went into the possession of the daughter". The ring was gone because the old lady had injured her hand and put the ring on the other finger, from where it had slipped off.
"He lost it the morning of the same day I was walking my dog", says Gerli.
Although media attention has been focused mainly on Pärnu and the Weekend, it is not the only music festival this weekend.
There are also loyal fans at the Intsikurmu festival in Põlvamaa.
One of them, for example, writes on Twitter: "I sold the Weekend ticket so I could go to Intsikurmu".
And why not?
In addition to domestic artists, performers from America, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England and elsewhere will also perform there.
The festival in the magical forest surprises the artists who perform there because of its charming location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, had no idea on Twitter early this morning how beautiful Estonia is.
But visitors haven't been a snitch in sharing fun things either.

The Estonian U18 team recognised Great Britain's superiority in the semi-finals and the A-division will not get away
The match started at an extremely paced rate, and in the first quarter of the quarter, which the British won by five points (18:23), many baskets were thrown.
In the second quarter, the gap increased further, and a break was made in the nine-point success of the guests (31:40).
Estonia managed to win the third quarter, but with only one point.
The Estonians lost before the last ten minutes was eight points (46:54).
In the fourth quarter, the Estonian game dissolved completely and the final loss had to be accepted with the numbers 61:75.
The loss shattered Estonians' hopes of reaching the A-Division, as only the two best teams can get there.
In tomorrow’s third place game, Estonia will face the loser of the game between Croatia and Israel.
Police are looking for an Estonian criminal by a postcard
Europol is after the stabbing of the Tallinn nightclub.

Australia's leagues stand at a crossroads
Professional sport stands at a crossroads in Australia: some areas have migrated so far on the corporate road that they are too business-oriented to classify sport as a subclass;
Others return to the world of amateurs, which is too sport-focused to be considered a business.
This confusion is evidenced by the painful delays of Cricket Australia (CA) in reaching a wage deal with players, the indecision of the Australian rugby union (ARU) to sack the team, the uprising of stakeholders of the Australian Football Federation (FFA), the difficulties of the rugbiliga in assembling a functioning independent commission, and the relentless efforts of the Australian Football League (AFL) to be the flag bearer of social justice among the people.
John Wylie, an investment banker and chairman of the Australian Sports Commission, has sought to actively lead the Olympic sport on the same path as professional leagues by placing businessmen with no elite experience in the field of sport in leading positions.
The mining gigant Rio Tinto, who has a reputation for using tactic tamed by the unions, was seen in the problems of the collina CA in reaching an agreement with the Australian Cricket Players' Union (ACA).
CA chairman David Peever is the former executive chairman of Rio Tinto Australia and he hired the head of Rio Tinto and advisor to assist CA in salary negotiations.
It would be a mistake, however, to think that elite businessmen whose approach is ruthless in their dealings with cricket players do not love this sport.
Peever was, for example, a regular visitor to Storm's home games until he moved to another state.
Nevertheless, tough negotiations between CA and ACA and extremely high wages have given the impression that Australia's summer favorite pastime now belongs to more business than the sport's possession.
Conversely, ARU's incompetent leader, NAB's former executive manager Cameron Clyne's failure to pick out the Australian Super Rugby team has pushed the league back to its roots.
Ragbi Union people now prefer to limp to the suburban stadium to watch the game between amateur teams while sipping beer and eating a hot dog.
The Ragbilite boasts that they have the most corporately qualified and versatile board in Australia, but the league's failures in meeting international partners' requirements indicate that it is still too much of a sport to be a business.
Both rugby league and football have problems with management as stakeholders demand more power.
The chairmen of both leagues, John Grant of ARLC and Steven Lowy of the FFA, have shown that their business skills have not been enough to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, a former Kangaroo, managed a successful IT company but was completely absent from the game for 20 years.
It became a value when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent chairmanship.
Too many stakeholders who did not trust each other decided that no one could participate in the Commission's work, who has participated in the rugby league in any way during the last three years, except as a passive fan.
Pendel, however, moved too far to the commercial side, and the league's fans have been looking for a rescuer ever since—someone with a prominent past in sports.
Westfield's executive director of foreign investment Lowy inherited the role of chairman of the FFA from his father Frank, one of Australia's richest people.
A-league clubs want to be better represented in the congress electing the board.
Their owners lose money, but believe they are as dignified as Manchester United.
Ironically, the henchman of Sports and Business Ethics FIFA is sending out ambassadors to end the sport's civil war.
The AFL has its own ties to Rio Tinto through recently retired chairman Mike Fitzpatrick and former AFL commissioner Chris Lynch, the chief financial officer of the mining giant.
Too proud to take the role of national leader in promoting gender equality, indigenous and refugee activities and gay rights.
Some cynics might suggest that this is done by prying government subsidies.
Richard Goyder, chairman of the AFL, said, stepping up to Fitzpatrick, "The AFL is more than a business given how it assists all these communities."
Goyder is Wesfarmers' soon-to-be outgoing executive manager and the AFL's first chairman not to have played the game at elite level.
Former Wesfarmers chairman Bob Everything is active on the board of directors of Cricket Australia.
The cross-cutting feature of appointing members of the management board of professional sports is often the importance of independence over competence.
In the throes of recruiting business people, they have forgotten something that might be called affection and passion for sport.
Moreover, many corporate heavyweights are not accustomed to media intensive and sometimes personal-level critical surveillance activities.
Nothing that works in the corporate world may spill over to the sport.
Flynn submitted a revised disclosure report showing additional payments
Michael Flynn, who served for a short time as President Trump's National Security Advisor, presented a revised federal financial information disclosure report on Thursday, which includes new details on Flynn's contracts regarding Trump's transition to presidential office, a company affiliated with an Iranian-American businessman, and the parent company of a data science company that worked for the Trump campaign.
In a letter that sent information with corrections, Flynn stated that his original disclosure reports had been presented in hasty circumstances without the usual consultation and review provided by White House lawyers and the Government's Office of Ethics.
According to the letter, Flynn did not receive any of the attention given to others as he was no longer an employee of the White House at the time.
Flynn resigned his post just 24 days after taking office amid rumors that he had given Vice President Pence misleading information about his post-election ties with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
Flynn was also criticised for the cross-border payments made to him during his work in the private sector after resigning from the position of Director of the Defence Intelligence Agency in 2014.
In information previously released to investigators in the House of Representatives, Flynn declared that he received approximately $68,000 in fees and disbursements from entities affiliated with Russia in 2015.
In addition to Russian-related income, information provided on Thursday revealed that Flynn has received at least $5,000 in consultant service for a project to build nuclear power stations in the Middle East.
Flynn's work on the project was made public earlier, but it was not known that he was paid for it.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to work with the SCL Group - the British parent company of Cambridge Analytica at the time - or the data science company hired as part of Donald Trump's campaign.
One of Cambridge's main financiers is hedge fund magnate Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is an influential Conservative financial supporter.
The Washington Post reported in February that Flynn was hired as an advisor to the SCL Group.
According to those familiar with his role, Flynn's goal was to help SCL's American subsidiary win new public contracts with the United States.
SCL also hired one of Flynn's former colleagues in the office of the head of national intelligence as the driving force behind the efforts to award public contracts.
Flynn did not receive any compensation or actual work from SCL, according to a person who was aware of its activities.
With new information, it was revealed that Flynn received approximately $28,000 in connection with Trump's transfer to the presidential office.
The largest publicized source of revenue is $140,000 for Flynn's work as an advisor and consultant to NJK Holding Corp in Minneapolis, which is run by Nasser Kazeminy, an Iranian-born and currently resident in the United States.
The Associated Press announced Thursday night a statement by NJK stating that "Flynn gave NJK Holdings advice regarding the company's interest in investing in securities".
NJK is funded by the technology company GreenZone Systems, of which Flynn is the vice chairman.
GreenZone i is led by Bijan Kian, Flynn's business partner Flynn Intelis - a company currently under investigation due to its role in lobbying on behalf of a company operating in the Netherlands that is affiliated with the Turkish government.
Earlier on Thursday, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), a leading Democrat on the House of Representatives' Committee on Supervision and Government Reform, asked Kian to provide information on Flynn's foreign business contacts and travels.
During Flynn's earlier security check, Kian told military investigators that his partner had several foreign business contacts.
According to Cummings, however, Flynn told the same investigators nothing about such contacts.
According to a person familiar with the situation, Flynn nevertheless passed a security check at the time.
In August the main performer was revived on stage, the singer was taken to Tallinn by ambulance
Ivan reached the end of the set when he was hit by a health defect.
An ambulance was called, who massaged his heart for several decades", the organizer Indrek Ditmann tells Elu24.
"There was a delay in the program, but the festival goes on", he says and adds, "The public has been informed, of course they also saw everything that took place on stage".
At the moment Ivan is on his way to Tallinn with an ambulance and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course we hope for the best", says Ditmann in conclusion.
Eyewitness told Western life that a health defect struck Denisenko during the performance.
First the man stopped singing, then the play started to pass by, and the man fell on his back onto the stage.
On stage came the Conferansjee Jan Uusõld, who asked if there was a doctor among the audience.
A short time later, he asked to pray for Denisenko.
Ivan Denisenko / Augustislus
Ivan Denisenko, or Ivan Blues, is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural figure.
Ivan's musical path began in parallel with art studies at the National Academy of Arts and Architecture of Ukraine.
At the university, he was immediately inspired by his incredibly deep bassist and invited to sing the Golden Gate of the nationwide well-known folk choir.
In the choir, he befriended people who introduced him to the blues and who later became his bandmates.
The first concert of a band named Ivan Blues & Friends took place on December 31, 2007, at a Kiev bar called Rag-Time.
Since then, the band has operated regularly, performing in clubs, concert halls and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes book in Tagalog language
"A Helping Hand" is the first book by Michaels, the BBC's former editor and mother of two children. previously she has written for Singapore Tatler magazine.
It took three years to complete the book, and is dedicated to his Filipino helpers Maricon Espiritu and Ginalyn Narag, who help with the preservation of cooking and son, four-year-old Joseph, and daughter, eight-year-old Florence i.
The assistants he describes as "family members" helped test recipes while writing the book. It is the first such book in Singapore to be published in both English and Tagalog.
"A Helping Hand" is available in bookstores all over Singapore at a cost of 39.90 SGD and also in immigrant centers abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He thought he'd gotten the stomach virus from a colleague.
But why were his symptoms so different?
At the trauma point, he was given a high dose of acetaminophen to reduce fever.
For the rest of the day, he was kept being questioned, poked, poked, and investigated.
None of the tests showed anything, but they didn't want to send him home.
He understood the reason.
For the last two years, he had taken a medicine called etanercept to treat Sjogren’s syndrome.
The medicine reduces the ability of the immune system to fight infections, and this limited its ability to fight infections.
Sjögren is an autoimmune disorder - a rather mysterious disease in which the body's own white blood cells attack normal tissue, as if it were an intrusive organism that sowed chaos in this case both in the glands that produce tears and saliva, and in some joints.
Weekly etanercept injections had been helpful in reducing her joint pain.
However, he knew that because of this drug, he was quite helpless in the event of a serious infection.
When acetaminophen began to work, the patient felt much better.
Doctors at the trauma point decided to leave him at the hospital for the night.
If it's a virus, as the doctors suspected, he'll be fine the next day and he'll be released home.
When Girard first heard of his new patient, he became familiar with the infections to which those taking etanercept are susceptible.
That list was a long one.
Viruses cannot be cured before diagnosis, so he focused on bacterial infections.
One bacterium that attacks immunocompromised people is a food - transmitted listeria bacterium.
It is often found in unpasteurized milk and cheeses and causes terrible nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that he did not experience.
Legionary disease is another infection common among those taking this medicine, but it had no cough or shortness of breath.
An even more common bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, may cause joint infections, but, again, it had no joint complaints.
Nevertheless, the doctor planned to initiate a broad course of antibiotic therapy that would cover all these risks.
On meeting the patient, however, it did not seem that he might be suffering from a serious infection.
Doctors at the trauma point had not given him antibiotics.
The doctor had the opportunity to delay the use of antibiotics and simply observe and wait, but if the patient had one of the infections he had read about, even delaying treatment by a few hours could have been fatal.
The situation was further complicated by the fact that the patient thought he was allergic to penicillin, although he did not remember what happened when he took it.
This created a shift in the risk-benefit ratio.
The decision of traditionally low stakes whether or not to start antibiotic therapy changes when its consequences can be so dangerous.
He asked a colleague, another resident, to evaluate the patient.
Girard did not tell a colleague that he was planning an antibiotic treatment, and he simply asked to review the patient and give his recommendation.
A colleague met the patient and agreed.
Although he looked good, if he had an infection, he would be virtually defenseless.
The doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
As the patient has experienced penicillin allergy, Girard should have her tested to check if she is intolerant to a drug that is not penicillin but a close relative.
Girard asked for a test dose.
If he had had a serious reaction to the medicine, he would have had a rash or his blood pressure would have decreased.
Neither happened.
Therefore, a full dose was administered to him.
A few hours later, Girard received a call.
The patient's body temperature had risen to 39 degrees Fahrenheit [39 ° C].
He rushed to see the patient.
The patient's face shone from a thin layer of sweat, and his cheeks were pink.
Although he seemed uncomfortable, his heart and blood pressure were fine.
The doctor thanked himself for giving the patient antibiotics.
He asked for another dose of Tylenol, and when he came to inspect the patient one last time, he slept deeply.
The fever had receded.
The sweaty glow and pink cheeks were gone.
The next night, when Girard returned to hospital for the night shift, he first visited the patient.
He had also accepted five other patients, but this patient was the one Girard worried about at home after being handed over to his daytime team the most.
During the hours when he did not see her, the laboratory had grown an organism in his blood.
It was too early to tell what it was exactly.
It was clear, however, that it was a bacterium that was strong enough for Petri to grow quickly, and that it was not Staphylococcus aureus or legionnaire disease.
The list of other options was long and none of them actually saw fit.
It took two more days before they could finally identify the bacteria.
It was a lysteria bacterium.
Girard, like everyone else who cared for the patient, was surprised.
As a doctor, you get pictures of diseases in your head.
For Girard, listeriosis was a disease derived from unpasteurised milk and soft cheeses and causing nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
He further worked through material on this unusual infection and found that while people with a conventional immune system may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly as a patient's colleague.
However, in pregnant women, people over 65 years of age and those with a damaged immune system, the infection may develop outside the gastrointestinal tract - sometimes without the usual symptoms - and enter the bloodstream.
From there it can spread throughout the body like wildfire.
An infection of this type, called invasive listeriosis, can lead to death in up to 30% of patients with it.
Indeed, although it is not as common as botulism, listeriosis can be as deadly.
Early antibiotic treatment can save life.
If it is a food-borne disease, what food carried this bacterium?
Although the patient and his colleague had not consumed unpasteurised milk or soft cheeses during the trip, an internet search identified an outbreak of listeria in Scotland that summer involving smoked beef.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they ate some smoked salmon.
The exact place they picked up the bacteria remained a mystery.
Once the team of doctors learned what was wrong with the patient, they were able to adjust the antibiotics.
His three-week treatment ended in July.
The doctors advised him to take it easy until the end of the summer, but by now he is feeling quite well and has returned to the museum and his beloved work.
He was praised for preventing a global cyber attack.
And then he was arrested.
When malware from Krono was first advertised in Russian underground forums in 2014, the price of $7,000 charged for it indicated that selling malware was a lucrative venture.
Kronos was advertised as a hacking tool capable of retrieving data, including usernames and passwords, ATM PINs and personal information useful in breaking security issues.
Motherboard announced Thursday that Hutchins was detained at Las Vegas Airport after a week of security conference visits to Black Hat and Defcon.
He had plans to fly back to his home in Britain.
The security community reacted to the arrest of its esteemed star with admiration and skepticism.
Some warned that claims against Hutchins could damage the relationship between "white" hackers - investigators looking for software weaknesses to identify and solve problems rather than commit crimes or sow chaos - and law enforcement agencies.
Others hesitated that Hutchins could have created such software for the attack.
In July 2014, he asked on Twitter whether anyone had a sample of Kronos, which is a seemingly strange request when he himself was the author of malware.
Although the exact details of Hutchins' malware involvement with Kronos are not clear, security investigators have often ignored legal problems when searching for vulnerable locations in computer codes.
In recent years, large tech companies have put out "fault labor money" to formalize the process of reporting problems for investigators and compensating for their work.
The Defcon Conference, an unrestricted gathering of security experts from all over the world, has also had a strained relationship with law enforcement.
In 2002, the FBI, for example, arrested a Russian encryption expert in a hotel room in Las Vegas after publishing software that, according to authorities, could have damaged the security of certain types of e-books.
The digital rights organization Electronic Frontier Foundation said in its statement that it is concerned about the arrest of Hutchins and will investigate the matter more closely.
WannaCry's ransomware infected computers that employed older versions of Microsoft Windows.
After the spread, the software encrypted computers and locked users' files, folders and disks.
If the infected device was connected to the network, other devices on the network could also be infected.
The attackers demanded that the victims pay hundreds of dollars to the bitcoin address.
Hutchins became a so-called random hero.
In an interview given to The Guardian in May, Hutchins said he registered the web domain after discovering that malicious software is trying to connect to it.
Enrolling the domain for $10.69, he triggered a so-called kill switch that stopped the software from spreading.
His original intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who works as a detective at the Los Angeles-based cybersecurity company Kryptos Logic, said in an interview that he did not attend college and has learned to write software himself.
The company did not give its comments.
Hutchins attempted to remain anonymous by communicating with the media through his handle on MalwareTech, but British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was lauded in the cyber security community for this achievement and received special recognition at the SC Awards Europe industry event.
Senate confirmed Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets, as ambassador to Britain
Johnson was Trump's largest financial supporter during the presidential campaign and was appointed financial head of his inauguration committee in November.
Longtime Republican donator Johnson also helped raise money for George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney when they were party candidates.
He previously acted as the chief financial officer of Jeb Bush during the 2016 campaign.
Johnson's great-grandfather founded Johnson & Johnson, a medical supply company.
Previously, the United States Ambassador to Great Britain was Matthew Barzun.
Barzuni was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013 and resigned from his post in January of that year before being sworn in by Trump.
Belgian officials already knew about egg contamination in June
"We knew already at the beginning of June about possible problems with the insect venom fipronil", said Katrien Stragier, a spokesperson for the Belgian food safety agency in the belief of the television channel VRT.
We immediately started an investigation and told the D.A. about the matter because it may have been a fraud.
Then the investigation became secret.
We understand that people have health issues and we are trying to answer them", Stagier added.
The news agency, AFP, tried to get information from the prosecutor involved in the case in the last few days, but he said nothing because the investigating judge banned the release of the information.
Hen eggs have been withdrawn from the sale in Belgium as a precaution until the results of the analyses are available.
Millions of Dutch eggs withdrawn from the market in the Netherlands and Germany.
German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt has called on Dutch and Belgian officials to clarify this quickly.
"No one has obviously polluted eggs with a criminally prohibited product", Schmidt told the German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Administration (VTA), eggs contaminated with pesticides produced in the Netherlands are unlikely to be present in Estonia.
"According to us, there are no Dutch eggs in Estonia", said Martin Altraja, a spokesman for the VTA, to BNS.
He added that there are also no other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia.
According to Statistics Estonia, eggs have not been imported from the Netherlands to Estonia in the last 10 years.
Eggs were last introduced from the Netherlands to Estonia in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticide fipronil reached the henhouses as a result of an attempt by the Dutch company Chickfriend to treat the lice.
The Dutch and Belgian media reports that the pesticide substance reached Chickfriend via a Belgian company have yet to be confirmed.
In larger amounts, fipronil is reported by the World Health Organisation to be moderately dangerous and may have a negative effect on humans, especially children, kidneys, liver and thyroid.
Is there finally a solution to avoid annoying robotic calls?
For Michael Rizzo, answering a phone is often a waste of time.
His Sports City Pizza Pub in New York City, Buffalo, depends on customers calling and ordering chicken wings, pizza and potato lotions.
However, much of the time they are automatic messages trying to push a scam through.
"It's getting to the point that it doesn't allow other callers to reach us," the 24-year-old bar owner said.
Help is on its way, albeit slowly.
Over the past year, new tools have been added to mobile phones, instigated by the government, to prevent unwanted "robot calls".
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed to allow telephone companies to block more junk calls and hopes to deter fraudsters with large fines.
According to experts, these steps are not a definitive solution, but they are a good start.
Federal and state non-calling lists should protect people from unwanted calls from long-distance distributors.
But fraudsters don't care if they break the law.
Fraudsters reach people cheaply and easily using "automatic dialers", which automatically make numerous calls at once.
It is estimated that Americans receive tens of millions of robotic calls a day.
Not all of them, of course, are deceitful.
Pharmacies, for example, send automated messages about filling prescriptions.
But all too often, you owe the IRS money; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; they offer a free cruise!
In addition, junk callers use sophisticated technology that shows a local or important-looking number, such as the IRS, as a caller on the phone.
The application of appropriate measures for "supplement" numbers would make fraud more difficult and help save millions of dollars for consumers in the United States, as argued by a group of state attorney generals in an FCC document.
Telephone companies and independent applications are able to screen or block unwanted calls by comparing them to known problem numbers databases and by analyzing suspicious behaviors such as a number that calls many people on non-calling lists.
Wireless service providers also have tools that add warnings such as "probably fraud" to incoming calls, but are not available on all phones or to many prepaid card clients.
They can be ordered from Verizon and Sprint for an additional fee.
Some Android phones, including Google's Pixel, screen junk calls for free.
Multimedia producer Jen Vargas (39) from Orlando, Florida said that her AT&T app will label and block certain scam calls on her cell phone, but she has dropped out on phone lines.
"I rarely accept calls from numbers I don't know," Vargas said.
Applications such as YouMail and Nomorobo offer home phones free but limited relief.
In the case of YouMail, the operator must allow "conditional call forwarding", which will forward calls if the line is not answered or is busy.
Nomorobo is not available for all home telephone providers and does not work with older, copper-based telephone lines.
It is also possible to buy gadgets, some of which are rather clumsy, which block calls on home phones.
Verizon is also testing the display of warnings about suspicious calls on the home phone number screen.
Telephone companies are already able to block certain calls that are fraudulent.
The FCC has proposed rules to formalise such practices and allow the blocking of other phone calls suspected of fraud.
This means that Verizon may block a tax-free number that accepts calls for a fee, but never initiates any of them himself.
Operators would also be able to block calls where they know that they are not legitimate, such as 911 area code numbers.
These rules still need to be finalised.
Maureen Mahoney, a public policy graduate in a non-profit consumer union, said these developments were "hopeful" but did not protect consumers from all unwanted calls.
Firstly, non-calling lists do not apply to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
In addition, according to Mahoney, FCC rules would only cover fake numbers.
Not all robotic calls are meant to be tricked.
The Consumer Union wants telephone companies to make call blocking tools available to all consumers free of charge.
In the long run, the FCC industry supports efforts to confirm that the caller is really who it claims to be.
Maybe one day you can see a green bird on your smartphone screen if the caller is legal.
The lobbyist for telephone companies, U.S. Telecom, says it could take several years to put it into service, but it would be a powerful tool against robot callers.
The FCC is also looking for ways to stop following tedious calls to consumers who change numbers.
If you register on a non-call list now, but get yourself a new number later, the distributor may not know and may start bothering on the new line.
"Robot callers are not going anywhere," said Aaron Foss of Nomorobo, a call blocking service for mobile and home phones.
"They are criminals and find a new way to bypass any system.
But our job is to make it as difficult for them as possible."
There are several logical measures that consumers should take.
Don't answer the phone if you don't know the number.
Yes, this is unfortunately not practical for corporate call lines, such as Sports City.
Hang up unwanted calls.
Do not speak back or press any buttons.
If you communicate with them, they may mark you as someone who reacts and bury you under more calls.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use call blocking applications.
If you have privacy concerns, check the application's rules to see if it shares your call or contact information with distributors.
Do not provide personal information to callers, such as a bank account or social security number.
Rasmus Mägi: the preparation has not gone quite as I saw it in my mind’s eyes.
"Not everything has been the way I saw it in my mind's eyes", said Mägi of the trainings that preceded the MM.
On Friday-Saturday, there are important moments that show exactly how the body is.
And the contest will show you what we're analyzing here anyway.
Today, I believe that my preparation has been of high quality both this year and in previous years, so that it is possible to run normally first.
Nothing special has been dealt with on Sunday, after the home championships, by the date of the 13.05 pre-run.
In recent weeks, training is often too much.
I'm supposed to have freshness, and it might be very helpful that the last week before MM was a little easier.
On the physical side, the days left to take off run like this: yesterday the hurdler rested, today he's doing a warming workout.
However, he does not want to go into his mental preparation: "I have developed my own routines over time.
There's a lot of quiet and peace, and I'm not gonna let any rock music on my ears.
I don't need to watch any motivational videos or read self-help textbooks, but to be here and at that point in time to appreciate that athletes from all over the world have come together to compare their abilities in one place.
This, in itself, creates a peculiarity.
The World Cup is, of course, the top event of the year for every athlete, and Mägi has taken every previous start, also competitions in the Diamond League, as an experiment - tried some technical nuances, compared himself to some competitors.
There's no way to experiment in title competitions anymore.
"Here the goal is simply to run fast", says Mägi, but adds that if you can save even a percentage or a few of your energy in the premier run and potentially in the semifinals, they will definitely be useful in the next run.
The Finns threw a dance party for their men.
When the first men's dance party was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organisers could not even dream that the northern neighbours would follow the example of a small Estonian town.
Today, however, the first Finnish men’s dance party is held in Lapua, Western Finland.
"The representatives of the city of Lapua were so excited about the last men's dance party in Rakvere that they wanted to organise something similar", said Kairit Pihlak, deputy mayor of Rakvere.
"This is how 2 performances of Mies-Tanssipido will take place today at the Lapua baseball stadium in Finland, as part of Finland's 100 celebrations, where 100 men from Virumaa will also perform", said Pihlak.
According to Pihlaku, this is an excellent example of good cooperation between the two towns of friendship.
It also celebrates the anniversary years of the Estonian and Finnish republics.
Amongst the hundred dancers is Rocket 69 over-the-counter season winner Karl Rinkubjas.
"I am honored to be one of a hundred men who, by their participation in Finland, show what Viru's men are capable of", he said.
"Men dancing in Rakvere have set all their joints in order to show a decent level with their northern neighbours in preparation for the Finnish men's dance party", said Ain Suurkaev, member of Rakvere city government.
The performance of the men of Virumaa has been put together by dance ensemble Tarvanpää's artistic director Tiiu Mürk along with renowned choir leader Elo Üleoja.
Estonian choreography is based on Estonian choral music.
The first Estonian men’s dance party was organised in 2006 and the last one was held in Rakvere in 2015.
In anticipation of the evening's disc emissions finale: Will Gerd Kanter make MM's history?
The current MM is the eighth for Kanter; none of its competitors in London have achieved such an achievement.
In addition, Kanter is the only disc thrower in history to have won a full set of medals (gold, two silvers and two bronzes) from MM.
As of today (5 August 2017), Kanter is 38 years and 92 days old.
If an Estonian casts himself as a double world champion, he will become the oldest disc thrower to have won a gold medal at MM.
The Polish hero Pyotr Malachowski (34 years and 60 days old) has a similar opportunity.
More exciting facts:
On more than one occasion, athletes from two countries have become world champions of disc emission.
Germany has nine gold medals, Lithuania has two.
The World Championship record belongs to the name of Virgilijus Alekna, which is 70.17 cast in Helsinki (in 2005).
The lowest result that has been won is 66.20 - it was done by Riedel (1991).
The results of the study show that cockroaches also distribute seeds
Like birds and mammals, cockroaches spread seeds.
These insects are known primarily as decomposers, helping to disintegrate the decaying matter beneath the forest.
The roaches, however, also help to spread the seeds.
Japanese scientists discovered that cockroaches play an important role in spreading seeds of the forest species Monotropastrum humile.
It's an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophyll, therefore it is not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species receives its nutrients from fungi growing under the ground.
The plant sheds small, odorless and pale white fruits on the forest floor.
The fruit has very little or no taste, and Japanese researchers found that bird and mammal species are not interested in them as a source of food.
Only a handful of invertebrates consumed pulp and the forest cockroach Blattella nipponica was the only species to regularly visit the fruits.
Investigators checked cockroach feces to determine if these insects were helping to spread the seeds of the plant.
Scientists found that each fecal tomp released after eating fruit contained an average of three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the digested seeds were viable.
Scientists suggest that this unique plant species is likely to have learned to exploit the ability to spread the seeds of cockroaches during evolution.
The fruit of the plant hangs close to the ground and is ripened at the same time as the cockroaches emerge from their larval stages.
Investigators published their findings in this week's Journal of the Linnean Society.
"Taking into account that around 4600 cockroach species have been identified so far, seed distribution through cockroaches may be a much broader and still simply undocumented mechanism, not just the unique ability of a particular plant species to exploit cockroaches," said Naoto Sugiura, associate professor at Kumamoto University in a press release.
"It is hoped that publicized findings will encourage people to pay more attention to the relationship between plants and cockroaches and to look for further examples of how cockroaches spread seeds."
A childhood friend of the Duchess of Cambridge should have had the "right to die"
A childhood friend with the terminal illness of the Duchess of Cambridge should have been allowed to end his life, according to his mother.
Isobel Kennerley, who was a member of the Duchess's guide group, pleaded after three years of fighting a brain tumor that caused him "extreme pain, suffering and loss of dignity" to be allowed to die.
A 34-year-old woman with cerebral palsy in children was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2014, but suffered horribly, according to her mother, before finally dying in May.
Christine Eeley, 65, of Newbury, Berks, has called for a change in the law that would allow those suffering from a terminal illness and mentally competent people to "check the manner and timing of their death".
He said that her daughter's painful death caused her "serious trauma", and wished that the law would have allowed her to lay down a plan that would have allowed her daughter to die with dignity if her condition worsened.
Chinese Internet censors play complex cat and mouse games
According to experts, the shift, which can affect many users from researchers to businesses, suggests that China is increasingly concerned about the influence of the Internet.
"It seems the restrictions are becoming increasingly intense, but at the same time the internet is more powerful than ever," said Emily Parker, who has written the book Now I Know Who My Comrades Are, which deals with the influence of the Internet in China, Cuba and Russia.
The restrictions imposed on the Beijing Internet are proportional to the influence of the Internet in China.
Experts claim that China has not yet strengthened control as much as possible, and in many cases the game of cat and mouse continues.
One day after Apple's launch last week, people began to spread on Chinese social media a way to get access to tools that were so easy that even a tech stranger could do it.
This included registering a human app store in another country where VPN applications are still available.
Nevertheless, the four-day test shows that China wishes to change the game in favour of the cat.
Several Chinese Internet service providers said on Thursday on their social media accounts, websites or emails that Chinese security officials are testing a new way to find Internet addresses for those services that host or use illegal content.
Once these have been found, authorities will, according to these companies, ask Internet service providers to require their customers to cease such activities.
If customers continue, service providers and Chinese officials will interrupt their connection in minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to the faxed request for comments on the matter.
Research suggests that tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people in China use VPNs and other types of software to bypass the Great Firewall.
Although many people are rejected by the blockades of foreign television programs and pornography, China’s vast web - smart Internet user community is facing only minor challenges.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has been responsible for new elements of internet control over the years, but he has also highlighted technology and the internet as critical factors in China's future economic development.
As cyberspace has begun to play a more central role throughout China, government control elements have evolved.
It is difficult to find out the extent of the new efforts, as many users and companies do not discuss them publicly, fearing that the Chinese government will be disdained.
However, some frequent users have said that it is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid restrictions.
A student studying in the United States and returning to China for a summer vacation said that his local VPN was blocked.
According to himself, he took this period as a kind of meditation away from social media, and he left a message to his friends on Facebook to explain why he seems to have sunk underground.
A graduate student in environmental engineering at a Chinese university said that without Google it has become harder to do research, although the university has found alternative publications so that students would not always need the Internet.
According to himself, he has now found a new way to bypass the Great Firewall without disclosing what it is.
According to Chinese Internet observers, some VPNs are still working and China would be able to do much more to intensify the restrictions.
"We believe that if the government had decided to do so, it would have stopped the use of the VPN much more by now," said VPNDada, a spokesperson for a website created in 2015 to help Chinese users find working VPNs.
"If the government had sent out more cats, the mice would be much more complicated," said a spokesman who refused to name himself because of the delicacy of the group's work in China.
"Probably they didn't because they have to give people or businesses some breathing space."
Chinese online restrictions are often cyclical.
The current climate is partly due to the upcoming important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, the 19th Congress of the party in autumn.
Five years ago, VPNs were hit by unforeseen interruptions before a similar meeting at the time.
Like economic policy or foreign affairs, censorship in China is part of a complex and often incomplete political process.
According to analysts, government ministries feel pressured before the party's congress to show that they are effective and able to intervene in case of a problem.
"This is certainly not the apocalypse of VPNs," said Paul Triolo, head of the global technology department of the consulting company Eurasia Group.
"A more sophisticated environment for users to navigate and new options and approaches will simply allow China to switch off certain parts of VPN usage at the time and place chosen by Beijing better," he said.
The Chinese population learns to cope with these difficulties at an early age.
Earlier this summer, Chinese internet giant Tencent began to limit the time during which younger than 18 are allowed to play the popular online game "Honor of Kings", allowing this to be done an hour a day by those younger than 12, and two hours by those aged 12-18.
This is why young Chinese people have started using an ancient solution - fake documents.
"Is your "Honor of Kings" playing time restricted?
Are you interested in obtaining a document indicating that you are older than 18?" asked a recent advert on Chinese social media.
"No problem.
Contact us to get a document cheaply."
Estonian heavy-duty horses will be assessed tomorrow at the Museum of Agriculture
This Saturday, August 5th, Estonian Heavy Transport Horse Day will take place at the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The Estonian heavy-duty horse is one of the three Estonian horseshoes next to the Estonian horse and tori horse.
Heavy-duty horse day will take place for the 23rd time this year and a total of 17 heavy-duty horses from all over Estonia will arrive at the event of the year.
On that day, young Estonian heavy-duty horses, stallions and mares will be compared and appreciated.
In addition, the work done by the best breeders is recognised.
As a endangered breed, there are a total of over 350 Estonian heavy-duty horses.
The preservation of the breed and the use of horses are also introduced in Ülenurme.
On the same day, it is possible to visit exhibitions at the Estonian Agricultural Museum, visit the Estonian Grain Fine and rye fields of the EV100 and participate in thematic workshops.
Visitors of all ages can find activity.
There are exciting games for children, you can ride a pony or a horse, take part in a drawing competition and visit the Three Pigs Science Theatre.
There is also a summer sauna where Estonian food and craft products are offered.
Estonian Heavy Transport Horse Day is organised jointly with the Estonian Horse Breeders’ Society, the Estonian Heavy Transport Horse Breeders’ Association and the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
Breeders are supported by the Estonian Breed Breeding Association.
Genie, a cancer-scaring cat, was named Cat of the Year.
The rescued cat, which supported its owner during treatment for bone cancer, was called the cat of the year.
Genie was recognized for comforting her owner, Evie Henderson from Lincoln (11), during six chemotherapy sessions.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016, and Genie's company, according to herself, helped her cope with several painful surgeries and long-term hospital time.
The cat was recognized by Cats Protection, a feline charity, at a ceremony in London.
Image signature: According to Evie, the cat was there for him when he lost his long brown hair due to chemotherapy
"I think he's the best.
He deserves it.
He's always been there for me," Evie said.
"He came to my cast leg and sat beside my feet.
He sniffed the cast and then jumped on the couch to tap my knee with his paws.
If I was too sick to have friends come to visit or go out, and had to sit at home, he came to me and it made me much happier, providing great comfort."
According to Evie, she has a special bond with her pet, which was a tremendous support to her when she lost her hair due to debilitating treatment.
"It really upset me because I had long brown hair.
But since it was spring, Genie was furry the same way, and the fact that I lost my hair and Genie's made a little bit of relief from all that shock."
Evie's father, Chris Henderson, said the cat had been a "excellent distraction" and described how Evie used to watch videos of her beloved favorite in a hospital bed.
"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it offered her something to expect when she got home for a few valuable days."
The 11-year-old said, "I missed him every day when I was in the hospital, and my family said he misses me too.
He's my best friend and I really don't know what I'd do without him."
Report: Mueller convened jury in Russia-related investigation
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that a special prosecutor investigating possible links between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign has convened a grand jury.
The slate states that the jury is a new and significant advance in the investigative work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller regarding whether Trump or his main advisors conspired with Moscow to advance the 2016 Republican presidential campaign.
NBC News has previously reported that before Mueller, a former FBI director now in charge of this critical investigation, was appointed, state prosecutors had used the jury as part of an investigation into the actions of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort.
One of the president's personal lawyers, John Dowd, told NBC News that he was unaware that Mueller had begun using the jury.
"We have been working with Bob Mueller and his team since June 1 because we want to get this thing over with," he said.
"In the background of the federal jury assembly news, we have no reason to believe that President Trump is under investigation."
NBC News has not independently corroborated the Journal's records.
The use of the jury is a conventional part of a complex investigation and is not a tool designed solely to listen to testimony, but also to obtain information and data from individuals or businesses.
It is a powerful tool that prosecutors can use to pursue charges and subpoenas, and it may indicate that Mueller's work is far from being done.
Trump has denied that he or any member of his team had a plan with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also denied playing the role in Trump's surprising victory last November.
Presidential Special Counsel Ty Cobb said he was unaware that Mr. Mueller had begun using the new jury body.
"As far as the grand jury is concerned, it is usually secret," said Cobb in a statement.
The White House is in favor of anything that will speed up the fair completion of his work.
The White House is fully committed to working with Mueller.
Former FBI director Jim Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed."
"Flying American" under a black sail
Of course I've heard of flying ships.
Who isn't?
After all, wingers travel several times a day between Tallinn and Helsinki.
It's nothing special.
The Swiss company Supramar brought the first "foiliva" boat, the Freccia d'Oro or the Golden Arrow, to the market in 1952.
The technology existed before, but right now I'm facing a wind-powered vessel.
A catamaran, yes, but a sailboat.
What formula is it supposed to take off?
However, let us save ourselves from the formula (it is not difficult to find) and take a look at the concept of "foiling" by a simple peasant.
Why do planes stay in the air?
The shape of the wing is such that when the plane continues at high speed, the air flowing under and over the wing at different speeds, due to the difference in pressure, generates aerodynamic lift force, at one point it exceeds the plane's mass and lifts the entire machine into the air.
Essentially the same process takes place in water.
The right-shaped wing creates lift force as it moves forward at high speed, and that is what lifts the "wing" base out of the water.
It's easy, isn't it?
It gets complicated when you get to the numbers.
The plane needs a minimum speed of 150-250 kilometers per hour to take off, while the world record of sailboat speed is currently "only" at 121.1 km/h.
But let us not get caught up in high school physics!
Today I have come to see the "flying" catamaran, which bears the name NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
The NACRA comes together under the name North-American Catamaran Racing Association from the front stars.
FCS is an abbreviation of Flight Control System.
This is a system that allows the crew to set the base also in the middle of the "flight", and 20 shows the length of the sailboat in the legs.
As soon as the catamaran is released from its cover, it is clear that this is not a gentleman's Sunday sailboat.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sametvest stayed on the pier today.
The Beep and the Glasses couldn't fit on board.
This one's hardcore.
It's Speed in the Cube.
"It's carbon fibre?" I ask pointing at the sail.
Yeah, it's all carbon fiber.
"All the sail then?" I don't really understand.
"No, the whole boat" sounds like a scarce answer.
170 kilos - the three of us who board will certainly weigh more than 170 kilos.
I'm comparing everything from washing soap to evening cars, and I can't get around it here - NACRA F20 is like an inappropriate tip gun for a street ride.
Pagani Zonda R or Ferrari FXX.
Built with one specific purpose - drive well-well-to-fast under controlled conditions.
An amateur sailer would also be shocked by the amount of security equipment that must be worn before going to sea.
Waterproof suit, mid-socks, special-hungry buttocks, sail gloves, harness, special life jacket, helmet.
In combat equipment, it's like adding an oxygen tank and as good as going out to sea, you could go colonizing Mars.
"So is there a high probability of going around?" I ask in a funny tone.
"Yes", sounds like a short answer.
"You've been around a lot?" I'm still probing the surface.
Okay, this isn't gonna be some kind of joke.
I'll put my seat belt on.
The fact that the Nacra F20 FCS needs an auxiliary boat and a minimum of two crew members to get out to sea also underlines the purpose.
Three at the most, so there's not much room for play.
It's dawning, why it's not a Sunday cruiser.
Leil's Forest Stories " Blog Archive" Lands and Roads Repairs
Once in my profession, all kinds of land improvement work will inevitably remain in my eye, whether in the forest or in the field.
Machinery and the quality of the works have improved considerably and everything is happening more efficiently than in its own time.
Currently, most of the former land improvement sites are being reconstructed, faults and blockages are sought and repaired.
More stringent environmental requirements have been added, which were overlooked decades ago.
Building materials have been renewed, for example, plastic tubes are now being used instead of the earlier reinforced concrete pipes for the construction of junipers, and fabric, called geotextile, is also used to secure ditch slopes in addition to stones.
In the past, mouths and silhouettes were secured with cast concrete tiles (MP, VKP) and mounds.
In order to protect the environment, sediment ponds are excavated to collecter ditches before drainage waters (underground drains, ditches) reach natural streams or rivers, which are expected to clear water from possible remains of agricultural fertilizers and poisons.
At the bottom of new sediment pools or ponds, wolf batons are often planted, or they begin to grow themselves from the seeds that have flown there.
Wolverines have the ability to filter toxic substances out of water.
The pond on the picture was excavated last year and this week the top of the pond was smoothed flat, a well of concrete rings was built to take firewater.
And to prevent a machine from crashing into the pond, they must have dragged big rock boulders to the side of the square.
In addition to clearing field ditches, forest roads are also being repaired.
The inter-forestry section on the picture should be part of a rural municipality road that also receives additional gravel cover.
To the right remains the state forest, with the reconstructable road continuing immediately ahead of the slope to the right and which will soon be completed.
The left one's got a private forest.
The freeway continues, and it is still in the process of upgrading the agricultural ditches and roads and of correcting the drainage errors that have become apparent.
