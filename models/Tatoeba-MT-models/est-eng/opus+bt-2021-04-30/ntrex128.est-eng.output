Members of the National Assembly of Wales are afraid to look like the Muppets.
Some members of the National Assembly have been dismayed by the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, or Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The subject has begun with a plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A member of the National Assembly among Labour said his groupmates were concerned because it rhymes with the words "Twp and Pwp".
For explanation to readers outside Wales: the Welsh word daft means napaka and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid said that the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed other names.
A member of the Conservative Party in Wales said that his group views the name change "acceptably" but noted that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "Muppet".
For explanation: in Welsh, the pronunciation of the letter w is similar to that of the Yorkshire English u pronunciation.
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill on the name change, said: "The final decision on all names with which members of the National Assembly are invited will of course be made by the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 granted the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public poll on proposals for a name, on the basis of which the idea of renaming the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament is widely supported.
As regards the official title of members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP’, but participants in the public poll were most in favour of the option ‘MWP’.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other designations, but reaching an agreement may prove a challenge for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill on the changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act also includes other changes to the National Assembly's working principles, including rules for the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the nomination of the members of the National Assembly shall remain with the members themselves during the legislative debate.
The Macedonians are holding a referendum on changing the name of the country.
On Sunday, voters vote to rename their country as the "North Macedonian Republic".
A referendum will be held with the aim of resolving a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to this territory and has repeatedly objected to running for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the name change is only the price a country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's bells remain silent, as Harlem churches are struggling
“The older people I’ve talked to have said that there used to be one bar and one church on every corner,” said Mr Adams.
"There is no longer either."
He said that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People communicate differently today," he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people stay every day".
As far as churches are concerned, however, he worries that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as managers hope, and "early or later they will be back to square one".
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments filled with people who do not lend a helping hand to the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he added, "who will therefore speed up the day when all these churches close their doors, as it is unlikely that the majority of people living here will enter into their churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of blacks − The Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the Church of St Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which had worshipped God in the vicinity until now, took over ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was occupied by an African-American congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against shoppers at 125th Street on Harlem's main shopping street when they refused to hire or promote black people.
In the fire of 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they introduced a carilion, or clock game.
Father Johnson's son and heir at St Martin's Church, Rev. David Johnson proudly called the carilion "the bells of the poor."
However, an expert who played the carillion in July gave it a different name: “cultural value” and “unreplaceable historical tool. ”
An expert at Tiffany Ng University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carilion in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a larger carilion at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What has been played in St. Martin’s Church in recent months has been the story of architects and contractors, some of whom have included secular leaders of the church, others a bishopric.
In July, the governing body of the congregation consisting of the church presidency, or secular leaders, complained in writing to the bishopric that the bishopric was "trying to pass on expenses", although the bishopric was not even involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some members complained about the poor transparency of the bishopric’s actions.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters.
According to authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived for lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and then swam in with others to help pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for getting the lobster, but “it became clear that the boy shouted, ‘ I was bitten!
I was bitten!".
His whole clavicle was torn bare," Hammel described the sight he saw when he arrived at the boy.
“I called on everyone to come out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
A boy in a life-threatening condition was taken by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of attacking shark is unknown so far.
The lifeguard and captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was then determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located at the top of the hull.
For research and safety purposes, authorities shut down access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours from Casablad to Swam.
Giles added that over 135 species of sharks are found in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket-like beauty products aisles there, where expert advisors also work.
As part of a significant penetration into the UK's £2.7 billion beauty market, which continues to rise with the decline in sales of fashion and home goods, wider line spacing of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, taking them into use in other stores as well next year if successful.
It invests in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to exploit the shelf space previously reserved for TVs, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it plans to double its range of beauty products to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in brand areas such as those currently found in Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-markets its brand of make-up products, Boutique, in which most products are suitable for vegans, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is testing single-sale licenses at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second will open this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and switching to daily purchases of small amounts of food from local grocery stores means that supermarkets must try harder to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that outlets are becoming increasingly similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to combat low-cost chains such as Aldi and Lidl by providing more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, the same has been done with Habitats outlets, since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported the sale of groceries and made acquisitions more profitable.
Supermarket's earlier attempt to upgrade its beauty and treatment product departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury experimented with joint ventures with Boots in the early 2000s, but this ended in controversy over how to share the proceeds of the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was shaped after Sainsbury's sold its 281 sons in the pharmaceutical business three years ago for £125 million to Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trading chain.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxury skin care products to the range of his four stores, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s business manager Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained workers who are always ready to advise.
Our brand selection meets every need. An attractive environment and convenient locations mean, however, that we are now a competing beauty trade destination that can change old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "infuriated" when television show host Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby is running out of time for Truly, a brand of household goods and clothing.
The pair's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark Goop.
The 37-year-old head of the television show This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star Peter Jones in his fury, stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand action at the last minute to focus on his new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources spoke that Jones was "hurried" when a television stargirl testified at a tense meeting held Tuesday at the man's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that his new contracts worth £1.5 million meant that the woman no longer had enough time to commit to the brand of housewear and clothing in Truly.
The business has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow trademark Goop and was believed to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was certainly Holly’s main preference.
It was to secure her long - term future, so she thought she would do it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything involved completely puzzled.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to placing the product series on the market.
Marlow HQ has a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of one of Britain’s most paid celebrities, the leader of This Morning, could cost the company millions, as a large amount of money has been invested in products ranging from sofa cushions and candles to clothes and household clothes, and this could also result in the product being placed on the market later.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Cap in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes an M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin in the ITV television series I'm A Celebrity.
One of Jones's close sources said last night, "I don't want to comment on his business affairs."
Hard talk, ‘after what we fell in love'
Trump joked about the criticism that was directed at him in the news for a comment that some consider "unworthy to the president" and excessive positivity towards the North Korean head of state.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his mocking "news anchor voice":
"I have not given up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in the second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear arms waiver.
However, negotiations for the nuclear arms waiver have stopped.
More than three months after the June Singapore Summit, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea would not see the U.S.'s "appropriate response" to North Korea's initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he stated that the US would continue to impose imposing restrictions on the country in the future.
Trump's pep talk had a much more vivid perspective.
"We are doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“War was about to begin with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now everything is very well between us."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced good results: rocket tests have been completed, hostages have been helped to be released, and the relics of American servants have been arranged to be repatriated.
He also defended his unusual communication with Kim.
“Being a president is very simple, but instead of allowing 10,000 people to wait outside to get into this stuffed stadium, it is better for us to have nearly 200 people here," Trump said, pointing out the crowd ahead of us.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance would not be needed.
Although more than ten percent of Lombok's population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
“Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international aid, so things are a little complicated,” Ms Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the area.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Board, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Palu in order to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly little prepared to deal with natural power.
Although shelters from the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are not particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given about the tsunami, the apparent absence of the siren of the tsunami warning increased the number of casualties in Palu likely.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is also challenging in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics there even more difficult.
A hospital ship that has stopped in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is headed for Palu, but it takes at least three days to arrive at the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's divided infrastructure a central part of his electoral campaign and he has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, budget deficits threaten the government of Mr Joko, as new elections are due next year.
Mr Joko is also pressured by tensions in Indonesia among the kindnesses, where members of the Muslim community in the majority have turned to a more old-fashioned form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes due to the struggles between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets, where machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons were used.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks a tie goal in a game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, tying the standings in the 89th minute of play at Stamford Bridge, London in a Saturday game.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqir, being about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal when his team led 1:0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting it in the direction of a distant pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area and hit the top right corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get in that position, get close to the ball and players like Shaq are giving the ball as much forward as possible, so I was just trying to buy myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told the page LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I made a touch, and I hit him with no thought."
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1 :0 due to a goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute of play.
The Blues' attacker pitched the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in that game before turning around at midfielder and rushing to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic pitched fast in midfield.
He then created a beautiful air-fed, leading Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard got through the defense and kicked the ball with a left foot from Liverpool player Alisson Becker past a furthest post into the net.
Liverpool will play with Naples in the Champions League subgroup on Wednesday at 15.00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in a UEFA Euro League game Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state's disaster authority said Sunday morning.
A number of people were trapped under the wreckage of buildings that collapsed due to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and the 18-metre tsunamis, said the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
With over 380,000 inhabitants, the City of Palu was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with puncture wounds was found at 07:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street.
Police are urging people who have moved in the area to contact them, who may have seen or heard something.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is only just beginning, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask all taxi drivers, especially those whose on-board cameras may have recorded something, to contact us as they may have information vital to our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, alleged friends of a woman came to the scene asking questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police say they are currently informing close relatives of the woman.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but police told him that no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was shocked to hear of the incident.
Residents were told that it might take hours for them to get back into the house.
A police officer reportedly told one man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
One woman was at the scene in tears.
He kept saying, ‘It's terrible.'
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still in the closed area and the third was immediately on its outskirts.
A number of police officers stood in the area and monitored the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about the event is asked to send a live message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using the keyword to the September 30 log 247.
The statue of Parliament's Cromwell is the last memorial, the cause of the controversy over "historic rewriting"
Its elimination would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts in the Taliban style, which was done by the man's inhumane followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as foolishness and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was impossible for Oliver Cromwell to remain intact in front of the memorial in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell neither looted the images himself in the English Civil War nor ordered others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of the man's ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent Cromwell presentation is proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the description of the history of the person to whom a number of people still think should pay tribute."
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people viewed Cromwell’s parliament as a defender of external pressure and, of course, of the kingship in this case, rather than a defender of modern times.
Whether this is an accurate reflection is an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that the mid-17th century strife has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer beat a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, in southwestern China, a farmer was attacked on the market by a pig who killed the man.
The man, who was identified solely by the surname Yuan, was found dead with an injured artery and covered with blood near the piglu in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported the South China newspaper Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig keeper prepared to vaccinate pigs in his barn in Qinghai Province, China.
He had allegedly come from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday with his cousin to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin finds him dead and discovers that the adjacent pig feather was open.
He said there was a large hog with a bloody mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 249.47-pound orca had beaten the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and crushed,” the newspaper Guiyang Evening News reported the words of the victim’s cousin Wu.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday morning at 04:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found nearly an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are allegedly discussing compensation for the man's death.
Although rare, it has also been observed in the past that pigs attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm. The man was badly injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294.83 kg nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
When, in 2012, one of the Oregon farmers ate his own pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs would not normally attack, but because of the taste of blood, they may have to go head-to-head.
“They’re just playful.
They are very curious maracrats whose purpose is not to harm.
They just need to be respected enough," said the man.
Hurricane Rosa’s after-winds bring extensive rainfall to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken, moving across the northern coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
Nevertheless, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding rainstorms to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 05:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, Rosa was classified as a Category 1 hurricane by winds of 136.78 kilometers per hour, located 619.59 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to advance north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure area is beginning to develop over the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to divert deep tropical moisture towards the southwestern part of the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa reaches Mexico, where up to 25.4 centimeters of rain falls.
Thereafter, the approaching low - pressure reactive tropical humidity in the southwestern part of the country will produce extensive heavy rainfall in the coming days.
At times, between two and four inches [2.54 and 10.16 cm] of rain is caused by dangerous flashes, floodwater, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes precipitation to increase to five to about seven and a half centimetres per hour, especially around southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfalls of between 5.08 and 10.16 centimetres are also expected in certain areas of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
Emergencies are possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Certainly, tropical rainfall should not move on foot in the desert in the event of danger.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to turn into fast-flowing rivers and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by gusts of wind and volatile dust.
The approaching low pressure will sometimes lead to severe rainfall in the coastal areas of Southern California.
A total amount of precipitation of over 1.27 centimetres is possible and may cause smaller flooding and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, with rainouts becoming extensive on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall reaches Four Corner on Tuesday and persists until Wednesday.
In October, major temperature fluctuations are predicted in the U.S. caused by the Arctic cooling, while temperatures in tropical areas remain high.
Sometimes this leads to major temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday weather is an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), reach nearly 20 degrees.
In the next few days, long summer heat tries to recapture itself.
Much of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to start in the warm month of October at temperatures that are largely around 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] from the southern plain to the northeastern part of the country.
New York City is expected to have 26.6 heat degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows the likelihood of high average temperatures occurring in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was watched by over 20 million people
On Thursday, over 20 million people watched the confessions of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman Christine Blasey Ford, who allegedly accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s, through six television channels.
Meanwhile, political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting the regular broadcasts to reflect Friday's last-minute revivals: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drafted a contract for the FBI to conduct a one-week indictment investigation.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed him drunk and tried to rip off a woman's clothes at a high school graduation party.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
The broadcast was likely watched by over 20.4 million people on Friday, according to Nielsen's report.
The company calculated the average viewership on television channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other channels showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems calculating the number of people who watch transfers at authorities.
By comparison, it is about the same size of the audience as the football finals tournament or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel opinion leaders, who have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a day-long session, Nielsen said.
With ABC's 3.26 million viewers, it remained in second place.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high even after the trial.
Flake was a central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit a man Friday morning after he was caught in a bullying by protesters in an attempt to take an elevator to a justice committee hearing.
He stood there for several minutes with his eyes down when he was accused and transferred directly to CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are utterly powerless."
Flake said that his department issued a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he had more to say in a sitting of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Cable distribution and broadcast networks reflected live coverage several hours later when the Legal Affairs Committee had to vote to send Kavanaugh's nomination for the vote forward to the Senate House.
But Flake said he would only do so in the realization that the FBI will investigate charges against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by Democrats in the minority.
Flake was partially persuaded by a conversation with fellow Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and the other Senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an impact as it was obvious that the Republicans would not get Kavanaugh's votes together without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of political play
In an interview given to the Sunday Times newspaper, the Prime Minister accused those criticizing his plans to leave the European Union, of a "political game" with Britain's future and harming national interest.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview for the newspaper, with Theresa May on the front cover along with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressed his attack towards May's so-called Brexit checkers plan, saying that the proposal under which Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs is "totally mindless".
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of LSU player murder
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, Wayde Sims, with the fatal outcome.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison on a second-degree murder charge, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of opposition between Sims and Simpson, police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them, the CBS-owned television channel WAFB informed.
After questioning Simpson, police said the man confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer announced that the man's bail had been set at US$350,000 ($308,600.30).
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued an initial report Friday stating that a gunshot wound to the head caused death in the neck region.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Operations Task Force for Refugees, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and people living in the area for the assistance given in the investigation that resulted in the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports manager Joe Alleva thanked the district's law enforcement agencies for "putting care and justice on its feet".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 metre man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
His average of games last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the entire team had been "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
‘It's something you're always worried about,' Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash over Mexico City
Ashes erupting from a volcano called Popocatepetl have reached the southernmost parts of Mexico’s capital city.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday, ordering them to stay away from the volcano, as action began again in the crater, resulting in 183 gas emissions and ash eruptions recorded within 24 hours.
The centre monitored a number of rumblings and tremors.
Images distributed on social media depicted the front lenses of an ash-covered car in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano named Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona following a clash of pro-independence protesters with riot police. Thousands joined opposing demonstrations to celebrate Catalonia's opposing vote on the withdrawal.
A group of masked detachmentist fighters, held back by riot police, attacked the latter with eggs and powder paint, creating thick dust clouds on the streets, usually filled with tourists.
The scuffles also emerged later when police had to use clubs to control the fights.
For several hours ‘No oblivion, no forgiveness', the proponents of independence clashed with the pro-union protesters who shouted ‘Long live Spain!'.
According to the local press, 14 people who suffered minor injuries during the demonstration received medical attention.
Tensions remain in the area supporting independence a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but what the Catalans in favour of separation still celebrated.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although turnout was low, as those who opposed the resignation ignored the vote extensively.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to block the vote in front of voting stations throughout the region, which resulted in violent clashes.
Proponents of independence had spent the night in front of voting stations on Friday night to avoid demonstrations supporting the national police.
The demonstrations occurred, however, but had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a pro-secession demonstration with his wife, said he had no hope of seeing Catalonia as an independent.
“Last year, one of the best moments of our lives took place.
I saw my parents cry with joy over the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the important but small victory in the regional elections held last December, it has been difficult for political parties supporting Catalan independence to maintain the will to do this year, as a number of the best-known leaders have either gone into exile or have been detained and are awaiting trial for their part in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who is recording a demonstration with her cell phone to support the police, said the controversy was spurred by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalans who have been in a pre-trial prison since last year, announced that he would be taking part in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
“A candidate in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the retreat of democratic values and the pressure exerted by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested for ramming house with car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the house was repeatedly rammed by car in Londonderry.
The case took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
A bow arrow could also be fired at some point in the direction of the car.
Menga's kick gives Livingston a 1–0 win in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Promoted Livingston ragged Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to another loss in 18 games, when the man has been manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's kick proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level by a second to Hibernian.
Gerrard will remain undefeated in the first league abroad this season and will face the leading Hearts next Sunday, who will be behind by eight points.
Prior to this, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euro League.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded his undefeated attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of defeat since Kenny Miler's replacement last month.
Livingston loses chance against blunt visitors
Holt's team should have led long before scoring, as their straightforward playing style caused Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts waned in front of the goal, with Alan Lithgow making an effort to hit Craig Halkett's headbutt over the goal.
The hosts calmly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests in certain places.
And that's also the way the determining gate was kicked.
The Rangers gave up the free kick and Livingston had a chance, during which the scheme was played by Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded with it from the center of the penalty area.
By this time, the Rangers mainly held the ball, but were unable to penetrate the defense, making the goalkeeper Liam Kelly's side all mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the goal on one occasion.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor repulsed Scott Pittman's kick and Lithgow shined brightly in Livingston's yet another team effort.
The kicks reached Livingston's penalty area constantly and were kicked out of there. Also, two penalty kicks were directed away, one for replacing Halkett's Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was excellent, crossing the ladder upwards completely with expectations.
Their playing style and players have barely changed since their return to excellence, but Holt must be paid tribute to how he has toughened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, organizing an excellently organized defense while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worralli on the hind legs throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Regardless of their intermediate good standing under Gerrard's leadership, this was not enough according to the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball proved to be incomplete: reaching home only occurred once, which could act as an alarm bell for Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan’s Controversial Reception in Cologne
Berlin had both smiles and worry clouds on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been sidelined on issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police referred to security by banning a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared near it to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, much of whom are Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to host the President of Turkey in his country.
Fighting demonstrations show a split attitude toward the guest: some Turks in Germany welcome him as a hero, while others despise a man as a self-governor.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: cyclist killed in car collision
In London, a cyclist crashed into a car.
The collision occurred on a high-speed road near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time.
The driver stopped and assistance arrived to give the ambulance doctors, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision nearly two kilometres from the Saturday crash site on Childers Street, where the driver who hit the rider fled the scene.
London police said authorities were working on identifying the man and informing his loved ones.
At the scene, traffic is closed and buses are diverted, motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officials injured in unrest
The prison authority reported that six prison officials were injured in the unrest in a highly secured men's prison.
The unrest broke out at His Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 09:30 a.m. British summer time and has not yet ended.
Eight prisoners are involved in the unrest that is concentrated on one wing, involving expert riot police officers.
Prison officials were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison workers have been invited to resolve the ongoing case at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible will be handed over to the police and their prison sentence may be extended."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden was taken to hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
Last October, however, riot police were called to prison to quell serious unrest, during which prison officials were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden fires (for drought areas the hurricane may be useful)
The tropical low pressure doesn't hit Arizona often, but this is likely to happen early next week when the freezing Hurricane Rosa is moving across the desert in the southwestern United States, leading to the threat of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already arranged surveillance of sudden arrivals on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
According to the prediction, Rosa will head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area as early as Monday with rains.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure levels in a radius of 321.86 kilometers from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of between 5.08 and 10.16 centimetres, which can reach up to 15.24 centimetres in limited areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other desert areas in the southwestern United States, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Cemetery, are likely to have rainfall of 2.54 to 5.08 centimetres, reaching up to 10.16 centimetres in limited areas.
Rosa’s precipitation can be a blessing to areas that can withstand the sudden arrivals, as the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rainfall is likely to be beneficial as there is drought in southwestern America.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, or second-largest category drought, reported by weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa crosses the Baja California Peninsula on the mainland of Mexico.
Rosa, which was still at hurricane level on Sunday morning with the largest winds of 6.43 kilometers per hour, is currently 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 kilometers per hour to the north.
The storm comes into contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean, and as a result, it subsides slightly.
Rosa is thus expected to reach the mainland of Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or afternoon.
Rainfall in certain areas of Mexico may be high, leading to a significant flood risk.
"From Baja California to the northwestern part of Sonora, rainfalls ranging from 7.62 to 15.24 centimetres can be expected, ranging in places to 25.4 centimetres," reported Weather.com.
Rosa then heads north over Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as an early tropical low-pressure region moving across Arizona and reaching southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main threat that follows Rosa or its aftermath is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora, and the desert in the southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rainfalls can cause life - threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests linked to attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of premeditated murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton Sunday at 04:00 British summer time.
The victim was taken to a hospital in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials ask anyone who may have cell phone records from the case to contact.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered" the Democratic party "under sisterhood and anger"
"Supporting Justice Kavanaugh is the voice against the Democratic Party's ruthless and unwarranted tactics," Trump said in his cheer speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered" during his appointment process for the Democratic party "under sisterhood and anger".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, violently and emotionally repudiating Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that he was attacked by a man several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Also at the hearing, Ford gave testimony on his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "America saw Kavanaugh's splendor, quality and courage that day".
The vote given for Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote to appoint one of the most valued lawmakers of our time with an impeccable background in public service," he told a crowd supporting West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks remain until one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running" he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump claimed that Democrats were on a mission designed to "stand up and prevent".
The first main procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, the Republican Party leaders' senior assistant told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away when giant waves invaded the beach after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities reported Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday to a beach festival in Palu city, when during their lives, six-metre waves struck the beach, killing a number of people and destroying everything that was left in the way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their thing on the beach, not running away immediately, thus remaining victims” said the BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference in Jakarta, Indonesia.
“The tsunami did not come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with it, wiping everything off the ground,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved offshore at a speed of 800 km per hour before it reached shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to Palu 24 Centre.
Air photos published by the Disaster Board showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and water surrounded mosques.
Follow-up waves in the coastal town continued on Saturday as well.
There was a wave of earthquakes in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released on Friday following a strong earthquake was nearly 200 times higher than that of a nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city on the long and narrow bay may have increased the tsunami's strength, BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were found beneath the wreckage of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater in a 300 km north of Palu in a coastal area called Donggala, which was closer to the center of the earthquake.
Reports from Donggala "are completely incomplete and do not contain any information", Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 residents living in the region,” said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its crew and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“It is already a tragedy that can get even worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami in the town of Palu, although authorities said the waves reached the beach at the same time as the warning was issued.
The amateur footage broadcast on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building panickingly warning people moving on the street below about an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to confirm the accuracy of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that prevented communications in the Palu region and made it difficult for authorities to carry out rescue efforts.
The military has started sending transport planes that help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuations still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, remaining otherwise closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami rose to over 800.
This is really bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala made it safely to the town of Palu, where they are sheltered in tents erected in the courtyard of their office, they saw devastating sights on their way, Mr. Dosheba said.
“They said they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
This is really bad.
Although reinforcements forcefully began disaster relief operations, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid organizations workers were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and reinforcements can only be dispatched from abroad if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This remains a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can begin to accept international aid, but this status has not yet been announced.”
When the second night arrived in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing people were still full of hope that their loved ones would be those miraculous cases that would ease the tide of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was evicted from a sewer well.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was trapped under rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Indonesia's national sliding parachute team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing sliding parachuters for the Asian Games, which took place in Indonesia early this month.
The rest, trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, are his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
“As a senior slide parachute, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke about how, after the news of the Roa Roa hotel's collapse spread among the community of glider parachuters, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Pray competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
"I think that means the messages didn't arrive," he said.
Thieves took 23,585.88 euros while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, thieves stole €23,585.88 from a Brink employee at the Levees ATM, Newport Police Department was released in a press release.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM at an entertainment facility and was preparing to fetch more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
When the man acted, the other man “runs behind the Brink employee" and steals a bag for delivery, which was full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, writing a press release, but police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the early individuals is asked to contact the Newport Police by phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper takes his new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
While announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, the man wrote, "Former Kanye West."
41-year-old West has been called by the nickname Ye for some time and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change takes place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where the man is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show, who cancelled her concert "in a sense of emotion", the author of the show said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of a man's current performer's name, West has previously stated that it is a word of religious importance to him.
"I think ‘ye' is one of the most widely used words in the Bible, meaning 'you' there," West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“Therefore I am you, I am us, that is us.
I changed my name from Kanyes, meaning "this one", to Ye, which is only a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanye West is not the only rapper playing with his name.
Sean Combs is known primarily under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but that year the musician announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also used its name with and without a dash, capital and lowercase letters.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use military forces against civilians
At a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use an army to contain Mexicans".
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people while all of Latin America was on the move to confirm leftist student movements.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly grants to students and opening up more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracts young people towards criminal gangs.
The US is expected to double the funding for artificial intelligence.
"As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount allocated to research in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and artificial intelligence executive who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after various parts of the US government made statements regarding artificial intelligence, although the US does not have an overall formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China last year introduced its plan to be a player in the renewal of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A doubling of the Artificial Intelligence Research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the US and we are working for the next artificial intelligence breakthrough," Lee said.
Double funding would double the likelihood that the next major achievement of artificial intelligence will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the best Othello player in America. later, the man was on the board of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee praised the technology contests of the previous US government such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, a U.S. Department of Defense research projects agency, and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
"U.S. scientists need to work hard to get funding from the government," Lee said.
“China is not the one taking over the intellectuals, it is the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant researchers from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the US support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think that those who have received a PhD in artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card,” said the man.
The State Council of China published its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
"Chinese National Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners from both industry and educational institutions, while the White House announced the formation of a select committee for Artificial Intelligence.
That month, DARPA announced it began funding a $2 million initiative called AI Next.
But at present, the National Science Foundation is funding over $100 million a year in AI-related research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation aimed at establishing the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been amended.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing state names
The Macedonians voted in Sunday's referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia. This would be a step that would also resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from confirming applications for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a requirement for this territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries made an agreement on Macedonia's new name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that the name would damage the national personality of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian people.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not intend to participate in the referendum and that the campaign of irregularities had raised doubts as to whether the turnout would achieve the 50% participation rate required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum asks, "Are you in favour of Macedonia joining NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure accession to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they could live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgiyevska, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for the name change.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the Macedonian capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave Strumica their vote in a Macedonian referendum on 30 September 2018 on changing the country's name, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising chairs in front of tents for those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the door of our servants,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and get Europe-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investments into Macedonia with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority supports the change of name, as over 80 percent of citizens are in favour of being part of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said the "yes-word" would be "an affirmation of our future".
The results of a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies revealed that 30–43 percent of voters are planning to participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
A poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said that they would say yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would constitute the first serious blow to the government's western policy after the government took over leadership last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through all of Brighton's defense on behalf of the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling penetrated Brighton's defense, securing Manchester City a 2–0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like his goal scored in the 65th minute of the game came ridiculously easily.
The Argentine striker passed midfield at the start of the sequence.
He penetrated three of Brighton's defenders before reaching the open field.
Subsequently, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He penetrated another defender before running past several players on the border of the Brighton penalty area.
He then hit the ball to his left, where was Sterling.
The English assailant used the first kick to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to kick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a hit on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his legs," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that point."
However, Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues an initial head start in the Premier League fight.
The goal was kicked in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton territory.
He sent the ball nicely to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane got the ball kicked a few times before leading Sterling further away.
Sky Blues knocked the ball forward into the net just before it slipped out of bounds.
Manchester City will play in the Champions League subgroup with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at Rhein–Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the spoiler against Rockies.
When the Nationals missed the final tournament games, there was no great reason for a new start.
Fighting Scherzer, however, hopes to demolish the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockies, who leads the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West in one game, still has hope of getting into the final.
The Rockies guaranteed at least a joker spot with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wishes to secure their first division standing.
“While we are not playing for something, we can at least try, knowing that playing in Denver with the audience and the other team is probably at a higher level than any other game I can expect this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete here?"
The Nationals have not yet named the Sunday inaugural player, but are reportedly leaning towards a Scherzer pass in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th pitch, made a warm-up show on Thursday and pitched as usual on Sunday.
This Washington right-handed player leads 18–7, his ERA is 2,53, outscoring 300, and with favorable chances in his 220 2/3 this season.
Trump's giving a pep talk in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
This is a big event in which I am not running, but I am actually running. Therefore, I am everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely terrible extreme group of democrats, and you see this happening before your own eyes.
And they are determined to take back the power by any means. You can see their vicious and dirty game.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over for power and control, all they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give them that."
The Democrats are, he claims, on a mission designed to "retaliate and prevent".
“And you have seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “hateful, wicked, vile, and lying.”
He referred by name to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat member of the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, which was shouted down loudly among the audience.
“Remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, huh, what?
No, uh, no, wait – it was one of the worst examples of body language, in fact, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a great association.
It's intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When activists from my local party, Momentum, voted to condemn me, it was not very surprising.
After all, I am the last on the list of Labour MEPs to be told that you are not welcome, all for expressing your opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because she stood strongly for anti-Jewishism.
In my case, the judges criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On matters of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are strangely similar issues, on which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party's announcement stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and creative."
To a large extent, the experience of my eight-year-old local Labour MP with Friday evening general assembly meetings is exactly that.
As of today, this unfortunately no longer applies to most meetings, and the promise to be "kinder and generous" in politics has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different perspectives are not acceptable in the Labour Party, and for each opinion it is judged who is acceptable to the party's board.
It started just after Jeremy became leader, a fellow worker with whom I thought I was sharing similar political views in the past now expected me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would never otherwise have accepted, whether it was national security or EU single market issues.
Every time I step up in public somewhere, no matter what I actually say, it is followed by condemnation on social media, inciting my recall, ignoring the party's policies, and saying that I should not belong to the Leiborist Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than any of my fellow workers, since comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and judgment of those fellow workers who face sexist or racist abuse every day but never give up.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer such a great association and with any initiative of "unreliable" or changing the election rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years to keep my head down, to speak less, and ‘then all would be well'."
But that's not what I came into politics to do.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a school student 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had left my large school classroom on the verge of literally collapsing, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who need it most, acting both as a member of the local council and as a minister of government.
I've never covered up my politics, including in the last election.
There is no way anyone in Nottingham East was confused about my political views or the areas of disagreement with the local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Labourist party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not intended for Nottingham Momentum, but for my proponents, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of recall or political consideration will stop me from acting for what I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr moves to top
Two late events may have tilted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves a victory in this wonderfully fun Tennent first league game.
They are now the only unbeaten team among ten at the top of the table.
At the end, it was the team's high-level defense and better risk-taking that led to the home team's victory and coach Peter Murchiel has the absolute right to be satisfied.
“We have been tested at all times during the games and are still invincible, so of course I am happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "I respect Ayr, they used their opportunities better than we do."
An attempt by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute of the game, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a head start, but the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was relegated to the Warriors for the game, given a yellow card gave Melros a chance, with Jason Baggot performing a failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty kick just before the end of the half, achieving a standing of 17–5 in favor of Ayr by the end of the half in a single event.
But Melrose started the second half successfully and Patrick Anderson's attempt, taken over by Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken off the stretcher. As the game continued, Ayr increased the lead further thanks to an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was broadcast by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, was then yellow-carded, but once again Melrose's player Bruce Colvine's attempt for a failed transmission after heavy pressure.
However, the team playing on the home field regained strength and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing Climo on the no-ball penalty kick line, MacPherson put the ball down behind the advancing Ayrs.
Climo passed the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after the game was resumed when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong in the box kick and sent side defense Gregor Henry away on the fifth try of the team playing on the home field.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to enter the field of hospitality services after it was discovered that the man was named director of a recognized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a well-known BBC television series, which he writes and in which he acts alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final of the series, and Kiernan seems to be making life after Craiglang's new plans.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia without sea borders hopes that the court will reopen their way to the Pacific
"Mariners patrol naval headquarters in La Paz".
Oceanic blue flags fly over the buildings of the administration.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have received the slogan: “The sea is our right.
Restoring it is our duty."
The memory of the coastline, which was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, is still alive in Bolivia without full maritime borders.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and the country naturally expects a yes result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A number of Bolsheviks across the country view the ruling of the international court from large screens in the hope that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia, after which Chile, after decades of intermittent discussions, is obliged to negotiate with Bolivia to give the latter an independent path to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales, facing the controversial battle of re-election next year, is much at stake with Monday's decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, think that the court will probably not vote in favor of Bolivia, or if so, it would change very little.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands lacks the power to give away Chilean territory and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court is made just six months after hearing the final statements suggests that it was not a "complex case", said Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate.
And further away from Bolivia's additional causes, the last four years may have worsened the situation.
"The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by current Bolivian authorities," Zárate said.
Morales' militant eloquence has lost all remaining Chilean benevolence, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all this, the debate will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's verdict was unnecessarily urgent.
Monday gives Bolivia a "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in the country's relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's best-known presidents, would use the maritime issue to express political resentment.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," she added.
"The decision is a chance to see that we need to get over the past."
North Korea said that nuclear weapons will not be released as long as the country cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first unless they could trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN general meeting on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made by competitors' state leaders during the Singapore Summit to each other.
He comments at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to be reopening the deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, these are air castles, thinking that the US's continuing restrictions and refusal of a statement to end the war with Korea will cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington will be cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards disarming.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, skepticism is common, according to which Pyongyang plans to seriously abandon the armament, which the state probably sees as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on another Kim and Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows bring to view a series of massive head covers brought to buyers on shopping streets in their neighborhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, you will no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought to the stage a series of bizarre super-span hats as part of their 2019 summer season that blinded Paris Fashion Week.
High and impractical hats are in fashion this summer via Instagram and these designers have sent their stunning creations to the fashion outlets.
Valentino’s top work was a beige hat that covered the heads of models and was decorated with a wide border resembling the feathers.
Other extremely large items of clothing included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple, but their purpose is not to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also showed a strange choice of masks, doing so exactly on time before Halloween.
Much of the colored masks had a sewn mouth so that they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high.
One part of the creation resembled a diving costume with an air pipe and glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cream pan.
And if you go on with the giant moorings, you'll be lucky.
Fashion gurus predicts that super-sized headgear can also reach shopping streets nearby.
The super-sized hats immediately follow La Bomba, a straw hat 60 centimeters wide, seen on the head of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created a largely impractical hat that was thrown into social media, sent another large work to the productions – a beach bag of straw, almost the size of a model wearing a bikini.
The dark orange raffia bag, with raffic fringes and white leather sang, was the top piece of Jacquemus La Riviera's 2019 summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on shopping streets next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are important for world citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the academic excellence ranking and it also continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and joint success in sports, art, music, and other community ventures.
These schools, where more than 30,000 students are studying across Scotland, and represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), seek to provide their students and their parents with the best service.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession, and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you talk to a person in a language that he understands, it comes to his mind.
When you talk to him in his native language, it reaches his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's fresh exam results, we can see that at the top of the tables are languages with the highest passing rate among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score of A.
Data collected from a total of 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students received grade A in Mandarin, 72 percent received the same grade, 69 percent French students and 63 percent Spanish students.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as essential skills for life, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages that are now among the choice of subjects are in the curricula of private schools and other schools in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A study carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17% of respondents had a lack of language skills, among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find job vacancies.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory to prepare young people for their future work.
As more job opportunities are expected to require language skills, such skills are becoming indispensable in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice made, the acquisition of a second language will give a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov in 2013 among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to have this conversation. The only language with a two-digit skill was French with 15 percent.
Therefore, the funding of language learning for children today is important.
The ability to speak several languages, especially those of emerging economies, gives children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
Hulk schools tend to focus on classical contemporary languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the United Kingdom in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interests, private schools always have the option to choose between several languages, which are taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future brings them.
It can no longer be denied that, in a global business environment, languages are crucial for the future of the country, which is why it must also be reflected in education.
It is the modern languages that really should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Private schools continue to offer selection, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
Zealous admirers no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, his number of minutes of play still needs to be determined.
"It's more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was probably playing a count of minutes.
After training last week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to warm myself up," he said.
Trump's West Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his election campaign event series tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first campaign event scheduled for next week out of five, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote stands until Trump selects who to appoint to the vacant seat of the Supreme Court, he seeks to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened by losing control in Congress following a vote in November.
What time is Trump's campaign event tonight in West Virginia and how do you view it online?
Trump's campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia will take place this Saturday evening on September 29, 2018 at 19:00 East Coast time.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to be talking about the hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, which became tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct, while a Senate confirmation vote has been suspended for the week while the FBI is investigating the case.
However, the main goal of the campaign event series is to help gather new momentum for Republicans facing complex elections in November.
Thus, President Trump's campaign manager said that the purpose of these five events next week is to "encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand a majority belonging to them in the Senate and House of Representatives," brokered by Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so important to the President's agenda that Trump drives into as many states as possible by diving into a fast season of election campaigns," said a Trump campaign spokesman to Reuters who did not want to mention his name.
Tonight's campaign event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, may bring in supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and receive coverage in the Pittsburgh media as well," West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the last month, a state where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the rankings based on the polls.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President has come to stimulate his results," said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University politician, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team has enough nerve to compete, keeping hopes high before Sunday's solo games
After three one-sided sessions, the matches held on Saturday afternoons were perhaps just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating turning point pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sports, but players believe in it truly, especially in competitions like this one.
So, where do they think the turning point is now?
"They led by six points, which has now become four, so I think it can be considered a minor turning point," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, that is clear because it is led by four points and there are 12 points left in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel they don't have enough wind in the sails, but they do have a lot of encouragement, especially in the faces of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been astounding for both tit and grin and sets an example.
These victory calls from the throat became louder and louder with each round, overshadowing the decisive putt, which would have led to the fourth match's draw after he and Thomas were down with two.
His putt, which won the match on the 15th, sent a similar call indicating the man's belief that the Americans were not yet out of the race.
“You just have to play more focused and worry about your match,” Spieth said.
That's all the players can do.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players to have more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have the undisputed stars of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but beloved couple are four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to hit a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the Bogeys also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine Friday mornings.
This game and the way in which their energy flows into such a noisy crowd and back from there strengthens the view that the players that will be competed with on Sunday, and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, there is no player best known as Fleetwood or Molinari to confirm a possible European victory.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk of the glory of Europe is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, when the man was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the first nine dug a Spaniard and a Swede into a hole so deep that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But there's no one on Saturday to get you out of the hole.
Four-balls and even games are extremely attractive to watch closely just the interaction between couples, the advice given to each other, the missed advice and how the way can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken the lead with a strong head start for the last day, but this Quartet session showed that the US team has enough nerve to fight, which some, especially the Americans, have doubted.
Europe takes the lead 10–6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will get a good head start on the last day of the Ryder Cup, leading 10–6 in front of the United States after Saturday's four-balls and doubles.
Excellent duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins in front of struggling Tiger Woods to raise their current score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the lost cup in Hazeltine, ruled the American side in the morning four-ball, winning the series 3–1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the doubles game by winning two games, but they could not make up for the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to maintain the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who is called Molliwood after this rugged weekend, they are the second pair to have won four points in Ryder Cup history in their four opening games.
Having destroyed four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeauveel for sure: 5–4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed random brilliance, but by now lost his 29 four-ball and doubles game 19, receiving seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested himself into a four-ball morning, returned to doubles with partner Henrik Stenson, winning 2–1 with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world ranking.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held in pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Three-time grand-winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points as a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday.
They scored a solid victory in four-ball over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and defeating Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in a pair game, having lost two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team come back from a four-point deficit, going into singles games, though as owners, Furyki's side needs only a draw to maintain the Cup.
Although ranked second best for two days, after Sunday's counterattack, it seems that they are failing.
North Korea says that "by no means" they will not disarm themselves unilaterally due to lack of trust
The North Korean foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continuing restrictions exacerbated their distrust of the United States and that the country does not plan to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and making a promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the US responding to that," he said.
“Without trusting the United States, our country lacks security security and under such circumstances we are in no way willing to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints regarding Washington's opposition to the "step-by-step" approach to nuclear denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject the unilateral withdrawal of nuclear weapons, as Pyongjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump on the first day of June 12 between the U.S. President and North Korean leader at a summit in Singapore, when Kim promised to move towards a "abstainment from nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has wanted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to loosen the strict international restrictions used on North Korea.
"The U.S. is calling for a 'first nuclear arms withdrawal' and increasing pressure on the restrictions to achieve their goal by force, even opposing the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The idea that restrictions bring us to our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that continuing restrictions will deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for Kim and Trump's second summit, which the U.S. leader at the United Nations highlighted earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the meeting between three Kims and South Korean leaders Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea, rather than the US, were one of the parties to the question of nuclear arms proliferation, the issue of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such an impasse."
However, Ri's speech differed sharply from that of last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that turning North Korea to the U.S. mainland with missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Bad President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission..
This year, North Korea was praised last year by Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea at the UN to Kim's heaven for his courage to take steps towards disarming, but added that there is still much to be done and that the restrictions must remain in place until North Korea's nuclear weapons cease to exist.
On Wednesday, Trump said he lacked a schedule for this, saying, "Is it going to take two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that, "Enforcement of the Security Council's restrictions must continue forcefully and unfailingly until we can fully and definitively confirm the withdrawal of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions imposed on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Riga from the side of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
Following a July meeting with Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him for "gangster-like demands" within just a few hours.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missiles and nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States were to implement "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that by "appropriate measures", he meant the security guarantees promised in Trump's Singapore and moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to combat a growing aggressive culture where they study in caffeine-rich night-to-night learning marathons.
Students who love the academics of the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to the basics of caring for themselves.
The designer of this course, Harvard Medical School sleep doctor, and Brigham, and Professor Charles Czeisler, an expert at Women's Hospital, considered it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired by the course's creation after he gave a speech on the subject of how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I being told about this now, my last year of school? ’
He said that no one had ever told him the importance of sleep—it struck me in a faze," he explained to Telegraph.
The course, which first entered the curriculum this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes and also help to improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health at the university, said that the university decided to take a course on the curriculum after it was found that the students were severely sleep deprived during the working week.
The hour-long course covers a number of interaction tasks.
One section presents a picture of the dormitory. There, students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books and are explained about the effects of caffeine and light on how lack of sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of bedtime practice.
The second section explains to participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, along with interacting symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily established practice.
“We know that this does not change the students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, the night learning marathons are still proud, adding that modern techniques and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is still a growing problem.
“Ensuring an adequate quality sleep eve should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he added. “It even helps against weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger, making the person constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler create the course, having attended one of his classes last, his first Harvard year.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for both going to bed and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" produced by electronic screens and LED lighting, as it could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest play result when Dolly Menga's kick, sent by side Steven Gerrard, brought a 1-0 win to Livingston.
The Ibrox side hoped to get their first guest victory since February, when they defeated 4–1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager, remaining eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' poor readiness could never recover from it.
The Rangers thus fall to sixth place, with Livingston rising to third place, remaining below Hibernian with just one goal.
For Rangers, the problems may not have ended yet, as their attacker Calum Spence needed a head wound treatment after being hit by an apparently discarded object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side leading past Ayr and Betfred Cup in the semi-finals.
Holt, however, went on at the same time with the same Liv 11, who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with how his well-trained boys stifled their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the village, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored a goal as early as the second opening minute when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the semi-defendant did not take his chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but its defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-arch kick to the rear post.
The Rangers gained control, but appeared to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been awarded a penalty kick when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of play, referee Steven Thomson failing to satisfy the Columbia player's complaint.
The Rangers managed to make only two hits to the target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned about either Lassana Coulibaly's headstroke or Ovie Ejaria's event.
Although the opening kickoff of Liv's 34th minute may have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely because of their performance.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to contain Jacobs' deep heavy performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher kicked the ball for Scott Robinson, who maintained peace and chose Menga to just complete the plan.
Gerrard acted during the intermission, trading Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost paid off when the forward split Morelosi, but impressive Kelly swung to stop him from his place.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game that suits them, where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
Holt's side could have promoted their lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood firm, preventing Jacobs before Lithgow struck a corner with a large arch.
Rangers substitute player Glenn Middleton again sought a penalty kick when he went up with Jacobs, which Thomson again failed to satisfy.
Almanahh: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almaty: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and READING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From this foundation of science, Geiger's counter also became the foundation of pop culture as in the 1950 film Coronado Watches, in which they starring seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?'
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When wearing these headphones, it is possible to hear a pot of atoms extracted from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans said: “Don’t tell me, it’s a mess! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cheat cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach and kill rogue cells of the immune system to “see”
The vaccine teaches the immune system to cheat cells as part of a treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory
Then they are able to “see” a protein in common for many cancers and are injected back
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine to detect cheating cells to the immune system lost ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein that is common in various HER2 cancers, and then injected back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland explained: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of many types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which patients are taken from immune cells and trained to target cancer cells, has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West started out with the tribe supporting Trump, wearing a MAGA hat on the SNL live show.
That didn't go very well.
The show's Saturday Night Live studio rang a derogatory whistleshell towards Kanye West, after her mixed-up speech in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced his nomination for the same post in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, which bore the name Ghost Town and where he wore a hat with the letter Make America Great, he began screaming against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so much to white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist?’
"If I were so concerned about racism, I would have moved away from America long ago," he said.
SNL began the setting with Matt Damon, where Hollywood celebrity joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual violence.
Although this broadcast did not go on the air, West's noisy footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with a post.
West also complained to the audience that he had quite a hard time behind the scenes in relation to his hat.
“They mocked me backstage.
They told me not to go in there with my hat on.
They mocked me!
And then they say I'm in a drowned place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place? I put on my Superman cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments triggered the viewers' outrage on at least two occasions and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. According to Variety, one person revealed: “The whole studio remained dead quiet.”
West had been brought on the show at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande because the singer's ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West astonished many with the song ‘I Love It', during which performance he looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "One brave soul: THANK YOU FOR HURING TO RESIST THE PEOPLE'S MASS."
But the host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "who she is, and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I’ve decided NOT to reward (by buying my music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art') someone who, in my opinion, believes and spreads a world view that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," he added.
Prior to the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the former Kanye West."
She is not the first singer to change her performer name, following Diddyi, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has borne the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly deceased musical legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol.
Attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the case took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The fame of the Game of Thrones Kit Harington disapproves of the masculinity of the fang
Kit Harington is known for his sword-flashing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the actor (31) disproves the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit felt that "something has gone wrong" and raised the question of how to solve the problem of fanciful masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie (31) of her Game of Thrones, admitted that she feels "quite strongly" that this problem needs attention.
“I personally feel quite strongly at the moment that we have gone wrong with masculinity somewhere,” he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television is also partly responsible for the rise in fanciful masculinity, as superman characters are shown there.
He continued: “What is inborn and what is taught?
What they teach on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be just the way they want to be men.
I think that is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how can we change that?
Because obviously something has gone wrong for the young men."
In the poll, he also admitted that after the end of the series the following summer, he would never participate in any sequel to the Game of the Thrones, saying that he is "on the side with his battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit is involved in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to do with Game of the Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's character Jon Snow's beloved, in an award-winning fantasy series with Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased exponentially to 14%.
According to health professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases have arisen from sex, thus changing the past.
HIV spread in some parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had declined to almost zero, confirmed by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country's old-fashioned values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of disease are related to the inadequate sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to use universal access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking data from an employee's GOP senator, saying it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters condemned Saturday allegations that her employee had posted the personal data of three Republican U.S. Senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims were spread by "ultra-right" trolls and their websites.
"Vales, lies and even more contemptible lies," Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Utah).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, which had been posted by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the post, was linked to Waters' office and issued membership information for an employee under Waters, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is a complete and absolute lie," Waters continued.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and safety are at risk because of their fraudulent and false claims, are in no way responsible for this information.
This unfounded claim is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including one reviewer being former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial comes from anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he has a feeling that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not become angry.
They mustn't be defiant.
They must not question the prosecution's motives.
They must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during a four-day hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for the Waters seat in the interim election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s important when it comes to the truth,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned "the relevant agencies and law enforcement authorities regarding their fraudulent claims."
“We will do everything we can to find out the criminals,” he continued, “and they will be put legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.”
Film Johnny English Strikes Again review - an under-equipped Rowan Atkinson spy-parody
It is now common practice to search for Brexit meanings in all new British films and this seems particularly appropriate in Johnny English's action comedy parody series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and became a sequel in the revival of Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is it humorous to make fun of ourselves on the subject of how obviously stupid we are in the country's new export option?
In any case, the rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has received permission to do things again in his wretched way - and that this broad comic creation is intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it's an undercover agent who, despite his bizarre pretentious smoothie glamour, looks a little like Clouseau, a little like Mr Bean and a little bit like the character who set the tone for Chariots of Fire's insignia at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the character's traveler and the international mystery Atkinson, once played in the television commercials of the forgotten Barclaycard, who leaves only chaos behind.
There's only one or two pleasant moments in this latest JE film.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter when he was wearing medieval armor and the helicopter's wings for a moment swinging against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for making physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and strangely redundant, especially when "serious" spy films such as 007 and Mission Impossible also offer self-confident comedy.
This humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's clever adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent films Bean.
At present, the assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is forever valid.
The Cyber Hacker has infiltrated Britain's top secret spy web, exposing the personalities of all the secret policemen in Britain, thereby disappointing the agent on the ground - an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a festive and distressed character who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character excellently, but there is not much in the script to work on.
His intelligence advisors suggest that since all active spies are threatened, he must recall someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster at a fancy institution, teaching secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of great places where English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is flown back to Whitehall for emergency notice and is reunited with his former longtime partner Bough, who is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the shame stains of his Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, in places with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova impersonated by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the paw of a charismatic tech-billionaire who claims to be able to solve all British computer troubles: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin with their stupendous odyssey: hiding as waitresses, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos, in hillies secretly aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English launches a genuine disorder as she tries to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize herself with the interior of Volta's house.
This last section does not use any brakes, but as cute and impetuous as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV taste on it.
Pretty mediocre stuff.
And like other Johnny English films, I caught myself thinking: does the British film industry really not have a role to give Rowan Atkinson that would be fair to his talent?
The Labour Party denies drafting a plan where the British work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a pivotal plan that foresees that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party wants the company's superiors to pass on savings received through the Artificial Intelligence Revolution (AI) to workers, giving them one additional day off.
That way, the employees would have a three-day weekend - but they'd get the same salary.
According to the source, this idea would fit into the party's economic agenda, and so it is intended to tilt the state to the benefit of the workers.
Thursday's Labor Week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A source for the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a review of the bill will be announced before the end of the year.
"This does not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of both workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Greens Party also promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party stated: "Four-day Labor Week is not a party policy and it is not discussed by the party."
Undersecretary John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to refine his vision of a socialist turn in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to withdraw power from "faceless leaders" and "profit-earners" of utility companies.
The deputy chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover all their stakes, as the Labour Party could do "deductions" in connection with a perceived misdemeanor.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on company boards and set up inclusive ownership funds to provide 10% of private sector corporate equity to employees instead of giving annual bonuses of up to €561.65.
Lyndsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking on 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could affect the end of support for Republican senators.
In a Sunday poll, Scott Pelley, co-host of the show's "60 Minutes", asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I was going to the hearing. I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked him, ‘ Did you do it? ’
He was decisive, firm and unambiguous."
Graham's voice seems rockproof.
"I am confident in my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and this could only be changed in the bomb news," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how this happened, but I do know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone he has named could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming."
What is the global citizens' festival Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the annual music event is hosted by the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has an enormously impressive celebrity participation and equally impressive goal: eliminating poverty from the world.
Now the 7th Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn area not only enjoying singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. It is an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for the VIP ticket), concert guests had to perform several tasks or volunteer activities, send an e-mail to some of the world's leaders, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 more years to reach their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to take action, or is it just another click drive where people feel they are doing something important by signing a statement online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in an effort to achieve a number of different goals.
According to it, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and communications resulting from their activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the UK-based investor-executive partnership The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to "helping children exploit all their abilities", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens such as yourself, we can turn malnutrition into a historical footnote to social injustice," Tracey Ullman, the Ambassador of Nutrition, told the crowd during a London concert in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 actions calling for improvements in maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced a funding project, The Power of Nutrition, reaching 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the FAQs on your website, which asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult road — sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we are confident of our success because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a couple of performers who will perform at this year's event in New York City, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy's "barrier" to prevent Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington may use its navy if necessary to avoid hitting the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, has been released by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke argued that Russia's participation in Syria, especially if it works at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the southern European vatsal," he reportedly said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve this.
"The United States has this opportunity to ensure, with the help of our Navy, that maritime lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he added.
Zinke's statement was addressed to the participants of an event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit association that represents the "voice of the US energy consumer".
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less, leverage and fuel replacement," he said, while referring to Russia as a ‘one-trick pony' whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is tasked with increasing exports of LNG to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are attempting to persuade Germany to oust the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin Moscow into a "prison".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project has been driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Alexander Novak, Russian energy minister, at a meeting in Moscow in September with US energy minister Rick Perry.
The US stance has been set back by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Association of Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she is seriously considering running for president in the interim election.
At Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his consideration of the nomination.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and improve our shattered government, and that includes the first lady," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I seriously consider running for president".
Warren also assessed President Donald Trump’s actions at City Hall, saying that he “takes the country in the wrong direction.
"I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has issued criticism of Trump and its Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's own voters do not think he should run for the nomination in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" Massachusetts voters felt that a senator should not run for office.
32% supported such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% supporting a possible candidacy, and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said it would officially decide by January, reported to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump gathering
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged
"What my son is going through, what he will experience on his return, I can relate to other families who feel the consequences and wounds of PTSD with which our soldiers return," he told the audience at Donald Trump's gathering in Tulsa, Oktahama.
Palin called his son's arrest "an elephant in the room" and, in relation to his son and other war veterans, said that "they come back a little different, they come back charred, they come back wondering if there's enough respect for what soldiers and airmen and all the other military personnel have given the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence against a woman, interference in a domestic violence case report, and possession of a gun in a drunken state.
18 states and Columbia region challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia region support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy banning shelter for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and districts filed a brief statement by court friends in Washington, D.C., on Friday to support a challenging policy regarding an asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name Grace v. Sessions suitis, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against Unionist politics in August, has not been published.
The woman said that her accomplice "and her violent gang-member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials did not accept her asylum request on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, among whom gangs and domestic violence are a major problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to file an asylum application.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a Friday statement that the new policy "is evading state, union and international law for decades".
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be dealt with according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such a requirement violates this principle," said a brief statement by court friends.
Lawyers also argued in a brief statement that banning immigrants from entering harms the U.S. economy, saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "offer the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June no longer to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum application is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear in relation to race, religion, ethnicity, or a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in a communication dated June 11.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertainment rescue operations in Palu, where deaths have doubled in the struggle to find survivors
The situation was increasingly threatening for the survivors.
“The situation is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fevered little boy in the Palu evacuation centre.
“Every minute, new people arrive by ambulance.
There's not enough clean water."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting out soaked things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was in the hands of a broken back and upper arm, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated in the field due to strong aftershocks.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a strong earthquake shook her fifth floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pressed against the wall in the ruins," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying with push-job advertisements"
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement under U.S. daily news coverage regarding the mutual daily benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the addition paid by China Daily last Wednesday in Des Moines Register - the largest-run newspaper in the state of Iowa - after China was accused of interfering in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, which China, however, denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing attempted to intervene in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other's import tariffs are adjusted.
China's countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to capture exporters from states such as Iowa, as they supported the Trump Republican Party, China and the US have been clarified by experts.
The U.S. Ambassador to China and the former Governor of Iowa, as well as China's largest exporter of agricultural products, Terry Branstad, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday Des Moines Register opinion article: "China has now doubled its bullying by publishing spurious work-advertisements in our free press."
"In spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's expensive freedom of speech and the practice of free journalism, putting its paid advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, there are only limited voices in the street kiosk in Beijing and do not see the truly different opinions the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media are firmly at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans will alienate female voters before interim elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will see a setback during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
Feelings surrounding the situation have been on the ceiling, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be retracted," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School, owned by Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday for The Hill.
Reeher expressed suspicion that the last-minute effort by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) regarding the FBI investigation was enough to calm angry voters.
‘Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November,’ said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn on Friday according to the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated ‘November is coming!' at a demonstration in their Senate corridor, as Republicans, who control the judges' committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic zeal and inwardness are starting to fall outside the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, an unofficial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
However, it may be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters aged 18–29, who do not like the president and often fail to vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which described his claims of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts predicted a setback as Republicans move forward with confirmation.
"This has become very confusing for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be put in office, it's also about how Republicans have handled it and how they've treated him," Priorities USA (a group that helps Democrats elect Democrats) drew Guy Cecil's attention to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided, who believe in Ford after the testimonies and who in Kavanaugh, but slightly more in support of the former.
YouGov's new poll showed that 41% of respondents believed the testimony of Ford certainly or probably, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh certainly or probably.
Additionally, 38% said they think Kavanaugh has probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitalia when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet that would face Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee launched a start-up company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project Inrupt is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an exceptional questioning to Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was to "govern the world".
‘We have to do this now,' he said about the start-up company.
"This is an historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data library" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a collection of music and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser and simultaneously.
This personal online database is made unique by the fact that the user is able to choose who gets access to this information.
The company calls it "the granting of personal credentials through data".
According to company manager John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company would bring sources, process, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to all.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project under contract, and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change if all their business models are fully supported overnight.
"We will not ask their permission."
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when it founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the network's neutrality debate.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: a memorial stone for a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The Church of England, which received the Victoria Cross during World War I, celebrated its 100th anniversary in its hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Rev. Bernard Vann fought out his badge of honour on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper bullet and did not know that he had received the highest British military badge of honor.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "genially symbolic" if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after Grandpa's award-winning fight.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann commanded his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick fog of and rifles and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and carried it forward with the “greatest gallantry ” before rushing to one of the machine guns alone and stunning three opponents.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanni was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - when only a little over a month had remained until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's action was "something I know I will never be able to repeat, but for which I will always be grateful."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann placed a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood's congregated youth band.
Michael Vann said he had "a great honour to participate in this parade" and added that "the presence and support of so many people shows that the true hero is appreciated."
The MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, but all they saw was Pig Peppa.
Imagine you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, but you won't be shown this main event.
The San Jose match included 13 fights, including six from the main chart, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK all night.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront each other, UK viewers were left with their mouths long overdue as Pig Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many were not thrilled, especially those who had stayed awake until the early hours to see this fight.
One fan described the shift to children's comics on Twitter as "some hurtful joke".
"It's government regulation that at 6:00 p.m. the content was no longer suitable and they had to switch to the children's program," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president on marketing and communications issues, explained when asked about the transfer.
"‘Peppa the Pig,' yes."
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they were going to work on their schedule to take more account of UK viewers in the future as well.
"When I think about playback now, I think we can solve this problem in the future," Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. Sunday morning there, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical disturbance.
But it wasn't, it was a government policy.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're showing five instead of six fights - as we usually do - we tried to offer fans more and we just went over time.
This is an awkward situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "undervalued" in relation to sexuality
Olympic winner diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling more inferior to others due to his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old young man said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everyone isn't like him".
While attending Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 broadcast on Desert Island Discs, she said she was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
As a parent, too, his attitude toward winning the Olympic Games changed, giving him the feeling that it was no longer so important.
Kirsty Young, the usual long-term host of the show, had to take a few months off because of her illness.
On Laverne's first show, Daley told me that growing up felt less valuable than the others because it wasn't socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “To this day, these feelings are that I am not worthy and feel different, giving me the power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was worth "something" and didn't disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double bronze Olympic winner has become the leader of the highly regarded LGBT campaign, using his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others as well.
The triple world champion said that falling in love with a man - US film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "took him by surprise."
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older than himself last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
‘If you go through so much when you were young' - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June; they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his ‘whole prospect' has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father disagreed to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London for 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that ‘Father, you can’t sit in the front row because you won’t be there by then”, he said.
‘I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually finished breathing and died, did I finally admit that he was not invincible,' he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, there is no better feeling about it," he said.
This also inspired her first choice of songs - Heather Small's Proud - which helped her prepare for the Olympics and still gives her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 air on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Mickelson was removed from the game at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to improve his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was removed from the game by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday doubles and four-ball.
Instead of being the center of action as he has often been for the US, the five-time winner split his day in two, being a cheerleader and working on his game in hopes of improving it.
Never the most direct hitter, not even at the climax of his career, is not suitable for a 48-year-old especially to play on the narrow Le Golf National golf course, with a long rough track punishing constantly stray hits.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who has joined forces with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win his all four races this week.
If the Americans, who are behind by four points at the start of the 12 single games, start fiercely, Mickelson's competition can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but did not have much else to add.
“He fully understood his part today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk added.
“He is very confident.
He is a celebrity and he has given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I foresaw more, but it happened, and we had to choose a path like this.
He wants to be out like everyone else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the most player to participate in Ryder Cup matches.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which, however, has never met his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has made an additional mental contribution to the team.
"He's funny, he's mocking, he's funny, he likes to have fun with people and he's just great in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week and it was nice to see it.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big head start could soon disappear
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that the big lead of the last day of the Ryder Cup at the start of single games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
The Dane entered the public at the 1997 competition in Valderrama, where, along with Captain Seve Ballesteros, a five-point lead was held in front of the Americans, but when it reached the finish line, it had drastically shrunk, with only a 141⁄2 : 131⁄2 victory.
“You even remember that we had a major leadership position in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, this victory came very little," said Bjorn in the picture after winning Class of 2018 5:3 on Friday and with yesterday’s success at 10:6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it could happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points.
We have a goal of winning the Cup, and so let's focus on it.
I have always said, I am focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I am not getting ahead of myself.
Tomorrow, we're dealing with a whole new set of obstacles.
Tomorrow, personal performance will count, so it will be quite different.
It's nice to be with the opposite player when things go well, but if you're there personally, you'll be tested as a full golfer.
This is a message you need to deliver to the players. Do your best tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner behind, he'll have to go and take care of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will act better in person than with the opposing players, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both over the past few days, being part of the Brookline Victory team before becoming part of the defeat when Europe defeated "The Miracle of Medinah".
‘I remember every damn word,' he said in response to being asked how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put everything in their game on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start hot, as in Brookline and as in Medinah.
If the momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average races.
Let's set our team up accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way where we feel this way a miracle can be born tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the race and is faced by Rory McIlroy of the best, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the race.
‘I put my boys in such a queue because I think that's the way we're covered,' Bjorn said of his choice of single games.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German Navy's newest fast sailboat should have come into service in 2014, replacing obsolete Cold War warships, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and increased costs as a snowball, local media reported.
The introduction of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class high speed sailboat flagship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz' has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to a military press release published in Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have joined the Navy as early as 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 replace the obsolete Bremen-class speedboats.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some cover-up technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and audible signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest high-speed sailboats should be able to be sent out of the home port for up to two years.
Constant delays mean, however, that the top-class warships - which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad - are becoming obsolete by the time they enter service.
An unsuccessful F125 speedboat appeared on the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after receiving it.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware deficiencies" that rendered the warship unusable if they had been used on a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important as Baden-Württemberg-class ships are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the senior Bremen-class fast sailboat workforce.
It was also revealed that the ship is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is probably twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including team training, also becomes a problem.
It has been said to amount to EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with newer high speed sailboats become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is shrinking.
Early in the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the Defence Commission of the German Parliament, admitted that the Navy actually had "exploitable ships run out".
The official said that the subject has grown over time as a snowball, as the old ships were withdrawn, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of the fast sailboats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Explores the Secret Life of Bats
A new survey in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for their food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future protective measures.
A study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland traces the common and soprano pipelles in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders are placed in the main locations of the area to oversee bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also perform field studies using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency of bat calls and the activity of the species.
A habitat map and report are then created to create a detailed landscaped picture of their behavior.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will show which habitats are the most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information helps determine the usefulness of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the bat settlement has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affects their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
They use complex echo-location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained professionals who regularly perform surveys, surveys, and sometimes save.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only special bat reserve in the Threave area in Dumfrie and Galloway, with eight of Scotland's ten species of bats.
David Thompson, the real estate manager, says this area is the perfect territory for them.
"In Threave, we have a large area for batsmen," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great place to live.
But there's still a lot to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us better understand what they need."
It emphasizes the importance of bat control before taking up maintenance activities on the property, as the unwanted destruction of a single breeding and birth site can kill up to 400 females and young, and even destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, disrupting or destroying them is illegal.
Scottish officer Elisabeth Ferrell of the Bat Defence League has urged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of our species and how their settlements feed."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers plan to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape charges against him as a "false mouth", saying that people "want to advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker have been accused of raping American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He has reportedly paid the woman €330 643.10 not to talk about the incident, Der Spiegel announced on Friday.
Turning to his 142 million trackers in a live video on Instagram hours after the allegations, Ronaldo (33) was reported to be "false news".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What was told today is false news," said a five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the news.
They want to advertise themselves by my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all right," added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel regarding "the disclosure of an unauthorized suspicion of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player is seeking compensation for "moral harm, which corresponds to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most severe personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged case took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's hotel room, where he was allegedly raped, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99 percent good man" of whom "one percent fails".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple's sexual relationship, but this was not unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because he was afraid of a "charge of hands" and was concerned about a "public humiliation".
Now a 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to refute the solution as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and that summer he moved to Italy in connection with a €100 million deal with giant Juve.
Brexit: The UK may begin to regret the departure of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom would "repent it forever" if it lost its position as head of the world automotive industry after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota ÜK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop their production at a plant near Derby in Burnaston.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of border crossing stoppages without a Brexit deal could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where vehicles are manufactured in Toyota Auri and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that when Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop in the production process at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Burnaston's Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without agreement, with concerns about the operation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down the Oxford-based Mini plant after Brexit for one month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
The Toyota production line operates as needed, with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, could cause delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to hold more than one day's supply at its Derbyshire factory, so production must be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers' plan regarding future EU relations has been "exactly calibrated to avoid such controls at the border."
“We need an agreement. We want the best solution that would allow us to do what we want, and not only to take advantage of the current success, but to take advantage of the whole opportunity,” he told the BBC Radio 4 show Today.
"The evidence not only about Toyota but also about other manufacturers shows that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs as well.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a spokesman for the Unite trade union who worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “From our experience, we know that if jobs disappear, they will not come back.
A spokesperson for the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's big stakes meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by another week as the fight against highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump's aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby threaten Mueller's independence has sparked rumors in Washington for several months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein didn't confirm that.
But last Monday he went to the White House, announcing that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then in New York City at the United Nations.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid collapsing with an interrogation by the Senate Judiciary Commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both gave internments.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's spokesman Sarah Sanders appeared on the news channel Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the matters that are under way in connection with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep the press up to date, as always."
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of infomercials was not due to deliberately capturing disappointment for TV journalists, although he added, "I do not dispute the fact that they have been disappointed."
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president is doing more questions and answers sessions than any president before him," he said, adding no evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
Question hours continue, said Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of this and you've seen how we've done it over the last few weeks, so it's going to take place during a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions while leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York City, the president may have demonstrated why, before attending the gathering of journalists on the coast and sometimes with a strange look.
Minister of Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland regarding fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working for the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish for their post-Brexit presence.
Jeane Freeman of MSP sent her letter with less than six months left until the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to cover the costs of established status for EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "In summer negotiations on the UK-EU resignation have continued, heading towards the expected decisions of this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I now wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every worker, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers support player Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a Saturday head injury and defeat 31 : 27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, published by Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury happened just before halftime.
“He fell on his side and just collapsed,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen on his side before being placed on a stretcher removed from the field for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center had ended.
Harris added that there are no details yet of the type/range of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Redshirted second-year student Abercrombie was in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 matches that season.
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp duty when buying real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This move will disarm Corbyn's quest to attract young voters.
Stamp duty is levied on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects it to generate up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax rate if they buy real estate in the UK, using this extra money to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to disarm Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises of affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp duty is levied on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, diverting extra money to the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The premium - which is in addition to this stamp duty, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on another home and on purchases related to releasing - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes this movement will generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the purchased London properties are owned by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet down when buying housing.
Many of the country's wealthy areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
A new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when they buy land but do not use it, and urged May to abandon the allowances for affordable homes in order to correct Britain's "dwelling-related embarrassment".
Corbyn has announced an eye-catching housing reform, including rent control and an end to the harassment of innocent people.
It also wishes to give councils greater powers in building new homes.
May said: “Last year, I promised that as Prime Minister, I would commit to restoring the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
At the same time, it is right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as businesses abroad, can buy homes as easily as British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too remote and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is Scotland's leadership"
Sunderlan leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's leader at some point.
The Scotsman (42) rejoices over the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently in third place in League One, behind by just 3 points.
He moved to the Stadium of Light that summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League the previous season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got into the B-class and that's what it was all about," Ross told the BBC Scotland show Sportsound.
“But I grew up with my father watching Scotland in Hampden, and it’s always something that has pulled me back.
This opportunity, however, comes only if I am successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as head of Sunderland have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
A former Alloa Athletic leader says he did not feel fear of such great and well-known names, having previously endured both in Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success at the moment is if I can take this club to the Champions League."
Due to its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Champions League," he said.
“Getting there is not an easy task, but I see myself successful only if I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has served as manager for only three years, having previously been Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among Hearts' executive staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling into the third tier and making St Mirren's lowest position the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he was during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
‘It was a real crossroads,' he recalled Alloa's takeover.
“I really believed that leadership was more suitable for me than playing.
It seems strange because I managed, got a reasonable income, and enjoyed some highlights.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I still experience it in terms of the tension and pressure of my work, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it. I feel more comfortable now than I've ever felt in adulthood."

According to the study, the best time for a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of pubs in British distress, but more pressure has come on the restaurant chains.
Figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, but that of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a spokesman for the business consulting company CGA, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s longer participation in the World Championships meant that July was similar to June when the turnover of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants went even harder.
In June, 1.8% of reduced restaurant trading deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded the most successfully and the restaurants that tried to please them were the worst.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as restauranters.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, while food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to sales outside the home market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant chains continue to fight, although the fall in sales by 4.8 percent compared to last year is particularly painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
A long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide some necessary relief."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand-related institutions.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion and is the benchmark for the established industry.

The study came to the conclusion that one child in five, some of them only 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary schools found a marked increase in the “fake Insta” accounts (reference to the image sharing page Instagram).
The news heightened fears that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic account" both designed to show parents and made acceptable to themselves.
One discoverer of his 13-year-old daughter's secret page saw a teenager inviting others to rape him.
The Digital Awareness UK and the Private Schools Uniting Organization Headmasters' and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, and half of them recognized the existence of personal accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing to see so many teenagers being lured into creating accounts online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes an athletics spokesperson on the board of the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive manager of the management at the annual board meeting of the Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most lauded athletics player, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidhi is respected everywhere in Scotland, the UK and elsewhere in the athletic communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from inviting him to the leadership," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I wish to be a spokesperson for athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
An American who won a total of four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in the 200 metres and 400 metres, and now frequently shares his opinion on the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that I would recover, and if so, to what extent, only time would tell.
I have worked hard, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I am already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ad that compares women to cows, divides the Internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the internet with two camps with advertising comparing the breast-feeding mother to milking cows.
According to rumors to mark the presentation of "the world's first quiet portable breast pump", a consumer-oriented technology company, Elvis, released an ironic music video similar to an advertisement to showcase the freedom that this new pump gives itself out to wanting mothers.
The four true mothers dance in a barn full of hay with the cows and sing, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see my tail” and “If you didn’t notice, they’re not udders, they’re my breasts.”
The verse repeats: “Pump, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.”
However, advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has sparked conflicting opinions on the Internet.
The viewers of the video, viewed 77 000 times and with thousands of comments, disagree, many of them saying that it illuminates the backs of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, but the difference is that they steal children from them in the number of days after birth", one wrote.
Elvie's breast pump does not puncture the breast-feeding eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter said: “Acceptably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use these babies to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep them?"
Someone added: A totally unfathomable ad."
Some of them are in favor of advertising, and a woman thought it was fun.
“I find that this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I were still breast-feeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a full cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but let's take it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: “It’s fun advertising (often in their workplaces or toilets) for mothers who pump and feel like cows.
This advertisement neither praises nor condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all danced in bras with not conspicuous pumps.
The idea of the campaign is based on saying that many women pumping milk from their breasts feel like cows.
However, the Elvis Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes and does not stand out from the breaststroke, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even go outside while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and irritating introduction.
By comparing the possibilities of women's expression and the cows of the dairy industry, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and familiar key the extraordinary sense of freedom created by the new pump.
This is not the first time that the news has echoed the Elvis pump.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two children carrying designer Marta Jakubowski appeared on the scene.
Thousands of migrant children quietly went to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children of detained migrants has risen sharply, although monthly crossings have remained quite the same, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies enforced by Trump's administrator have made it difficult to establish children with the help of sponsors.
Typically, most sponsors are document-based immigrants and have been afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country, requiring custody of the child.
The threat increased in June, when national authorities reported that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could provide fingerprints and data would be shared with the authorities involved in the immigration.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs management officer, admitted to Congress last week that the agency arrested a dozen people seeking financial support for non-accompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested lacked a criminal past.
“Almost 80 per cent of sponsors or sponsors’ households are staying illegally, and a large number of them have criminal backgrounds.
So we will continue to pursue them," Mr Albence said.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials enacted new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being arrested.
Many protect the legal content of immigration before a judge by videoconferencing instead of coming.
Those unfit for release will be quickly expelled.
According to the shelter's staff and according to reports from the system released in recent months - the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they become nervous or depressed, which could cause violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more topical in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficulty may be overlooked by size.
They added that moving children to a tent campus without enough time to get used to feeling or say goodbye to friends could cause trauma with which many are already struggling.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of U.S., French and Turkish occupying forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
According to Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegally on the pretext of countering terrorism and are being dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he said in the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that Syria's "war on terror is almost over." As of 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy war until we have cleared the entire area of Syria" from both terrorist groups and "any foreign force illegally present."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish units as well as Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war - torn country.
Speaking on the subject of war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and he accused the spread of unreasonable fears preventing the arrival of refugees to parts of the West.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return," he said.
"They are politicizing something that is merely a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no rehabilitation aid will be given to Syria until there is an agreement ending the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a buffer zone for the last rebel stronghold, Idlib, has provided an opportunity to advance with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale invasion of the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, in a province with three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that there were "clear deadlines" in the treaty and expressed hope that military action would hit the Jihadists, including the Nusra Front militants associated with Al-Qaeda, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to persuade a new committee of government and opposition members to plan the constitution of post-war Syria and pave the way for election.
Moualem made demands for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump is also elected for a second term
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if the removal from office and scandal had not previously ended his presidential office, as probably wanted by liberal viewers.
What would undoubtedly become “the most exciting end of the presidency! ”
At the moment, viewers show no signs of fatigue.
As of 2014, peak hour ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during peak hours. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has risen.
"This is the tension we are involved in because we don't understand it," said the head of the ABC drama Designated Survivor about the government secretary, who will become president when the attack destroys the parliament building.
Nell Scovellil, an experienced comedian and author of the book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," is another theory.
He remembers a pre-election taxi ride in Boston.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” he asked
‘He said he was making me laugh,' Mrs. Scovell mentioned to me.
All this chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, Washington's rumors may become fatal to Roe v. Wade's future and reunite with wanting immigrant families and the global economy.
Avoiding the issue is just the luxury of privileged viewers.
However, a six-hour expert talk show about Bob Woodward’s “in-depth background research” for his book Fear and Paul Manafort’s 13,225.73 € ostrich leather Bomber jacket (Washington Post said about it as “an overconfident garment”) and Stormy Daniels’s motives for describing Mr. Trump’s anatomy, the viewer is more than an educated citizen.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario with the same feeling again.
"One of his activities, which may seem like a reality series, is that he shares something every night," said CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series Pantingons, Brent Montgomery Trump's show with changing actors and daytime plot punts (featuring a fight with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

When he met Fleiss this week, his home was 80 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he had crawled into the room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not give up watching Brett Kavanaugh cope with the Senate Legal Committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hangs by a thread.
“I remember how we did all kinds of crazy shows in our time and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Elsewhere, money flows into the fiercest White House midterm.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district will receive a cash flow due to the reorganization of the congressional district, receiving two incumbents in the same place.
As a result, Conor Lamb of the Democratic Republic, who won a seat in the second district last spring in an emergency election, proved to be re-elected in the suburb of Pittsburg district.
Lamb's opposing candidate is Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the previous Pennsylvania District 12, which in the larger section overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were changed following a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, thus the old districts were divided into unconstitutional electoral districts, favoring Republicans.
The new 17th election has been triggered by a campaign in which the financial departments of the largest political parties are trumped with money - the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in the much-watched March Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in the emergency election.
This seat has happened to a Republican for several decades and President Donald Trump won in the district by 20 points.
Political opinionators have given the Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then retreated
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a minor setback for Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump met in a friendly atmosphere with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a Panama hotel until partners expelled Trump's corporate administrative team.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall American leaders of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama, as the ministry's spokesperson, Heather Nauert, said earlier this month that these countries had recently no further support for Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was scheduled to be punished, receiving $140 million in aid from America in 2017, including drug surveillance, development, and economic push.
The recommended penalties, which included a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to organize a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, seen as a development in efforts to prevent settlers from heading for the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials explained that they wanted to continue consultation and stop discussing any El Salvador punishments.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is now being criticized for speaking at a conference in mid-October to talk about the government's views.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of three American officials told, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions on the requirement to remain anonymous.
Their discussions were confirmed by a close analyst to the government, who also spoke at the insistence of remaining anonymous.
History of studies
Next, it may be that special prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on Trump's possible justice, of which there is a lot of evidence in the State Archives.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating in his study whether Trump's campaign is related to Russia's attack on our election.
If Congress were to change the party, Trump would have to report to this institution as if he were going back to talking to voters and perhaps even to his peer judges.
There are many buts here, and I do not want to point out that it is inevitable for Trump or his European counterparts to be dismissed.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were prepared for a coup against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Münich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-annual massacres.
History runs around such contiguous points, and the merciless march of democracy draws closer or is delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires Deputy Director Rod Rosenstein, the prosecutor, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that he proposed the secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his unfitness to hold the post.
Rosenstein says The Times' statement is inaccurate.
"How do you react if the FBI's newly requested Brett Kavanaugh investigation is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the mid-election if Trump should be held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter vacation.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our ambassadorial home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me a Sabbath candlelight on a table with a swastika.
With this kind of legacy, how am I not supposed to be optimistic about our future?"

The Rangers' Graham Dorrans are optimistic ahead of the Battle of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will organize Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Australia that followed an impressive draw previously received against Villarreal in Spain early this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for the European League G squad.
A knee injury did not allow center player Graham Dorrans from the first appearance of the season before a 2 in 2 draw-ending match against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better results.
"This was a good point for us because Villarreal has a strong opponent," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was generally a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game, and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but since the crowd supports us, I'm sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was a tough one, thanks to it, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all feel good.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed this with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide study participants said they would talk to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
"People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they don't talk on the subject," explained Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
However, this should be the starting point.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if they do not know your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely important in terms of costs.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan on how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid monetary life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or proprietary self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles in the bud.
Get yourself a health care credentials to identify a trustee to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes at a time when you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the trustee in relation to your financing.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write these things down so you'll be ready if you need to.
"This is not just about the financial side, but also about who would be doctors?" Martin explained.
“What medicines are needed?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Set it all up."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported, adding that the death toll is still increasing.
Since communications have been broken, rescuers have received no information from the Regent of Donggala, north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in the request after the disaster.
The following are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located on the narrow bay off the west coast of Sulawesi Island, and its population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city was about to celebrate its 40th anniversary when it was unexpectedly struck by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala regents is an area extending over 300 km (180 miles) northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regents, an administrative district under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the Donggala Coastal Region.
Nickel mining, mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowal, Sulawesi, is also important in the province.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, the tsunami hit the western end of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
The following are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake struck Indonesia's most populated island of Java from the south, creating a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The area near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province, was hit by a 7.6-degree earthquake.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Sumatra - the island of Mentawai, triggering a tsunami up to 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regents in Aceh, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the 2004 deadly earthquake and the destruction brought by the tsunami.
Tsunami did not occur at that time, but more than 100 people died in collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in distress.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska in connection with suspicions of domestic violence, interference in domestic violence reports, and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a female person attempted to inform the police of the alleged crimes, Palin took the phone from her.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su's Preliminary Investigation Facility and is being held against $500 unsecured bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he was "not guilty under any circumstances", the news network reported
Palin faces three class A misdemeanors, meaning he can face up to a year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanor punishable by one-day imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, Sarah Palin, his mother, was summoned by the police.
The case is currently being debated by the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in the domestic violence crime report, and possession of a gun, all intoxicated.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behaviour to PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
The earthquake in Indonesia was followed by a tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake on Indonesia's Sulawesi Island on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not functioning and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the outskirts of downtown Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The social media broadcast videos showing the moment of the earthquake.
During the Tsunami's capture, hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach of Palu City.
In NYC, federal prosecutors seek rare death toll on suspected terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, and this rare sentence has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing both pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
According to a death penalty request in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors are required to prove that Saipov killed eight victims intentionally and also caused serious bodily harm in a deliberate manner in order to justify the death penalty.
In both cases, there is a possible death penalty on the basis of judicial documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury filed a 22-point charge against Saipov, which included eight murder charges along with extortion generally used by federal prosecutors in organized criminal offences, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack assumed "large planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "terrible, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," stands in the intent message.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
It's been ten years since the last fatality trial in the District Court of the Southern District of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in 1953 in a federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, New York, when the couple were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an indigenous usbeck, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
According to police, he had told investigators that he was pleased with what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by ISIS videos viewed from his phone to commit the attack.
According to police, he also wanted the ISIS flag displayed in his hospital room.
In the 22-point charge, he has not pleaded guilty.
David Patton, one of Saipov's national defenders, said they were "obviously disappointed" in the procedural decision.
“In our opinion, the decision to apply for the death penalty prolongs the trauma of all those involved instead of a life sentence, which admits the guilt without the possibility of release,” Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
According to the Tory MP, the NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during today's Tory Conference protest.
A former UKIP leader said that politicians had to feel the "hotness" of Eurosceptics, as one of the members of Theresa May's own parliament suggested she lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative House of Commons MP Peter Bone said on the march in Birmingham that the UK "would be out by now" if Mr Farage were secretary of Brexit.
However, Mrs May faces a problem in reconciling her deeply divided ranks, highlighted by the Conservatives in favour of staying, joining their anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling with keeping his Chequers plan on track amidst Brexit supporters, Remainers and attacks by the EU.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite the counter-offensive and force the Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their package and "the chaos".
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave gathering in Solihull that he wished to "abandon Chequers' plan".
He suggested taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
'His responsibility would have us out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I stand for Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers plan."
Reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the recommendations that public opinion has now changed since the 2016 vote: "The belief that British people have changed their minds and wish to stay is not true."
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Tory Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: “I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
With a message addressed to May, he added: "The prime ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians at the gathering must be made to feel "hot" if they plan to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us—the people—and our political class" he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that we will not let that happen."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class, on the verge of Brexit’s betrayal, uncomfortable.
"We will mobilize the nation's People's Army that gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain."
Meanwhile, the icers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour gathering held at the centre of the city.
A handful of activists waved ‘Tooters Against Brexit' slogans after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Liberals mocked the Conservatives for their security issues that became part of their party's app at the opening of the conference.
“These are people who say that they can put IT systems in place and bring all the technology to Canada and more, for smooth border crossings, for cross-border unrestricted trade to Ireland,” he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
According to U.S. Elizabeth Warren, after the November election, she is seriously considering running for president
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at West Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run in the next election in November against GOP national representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign vice president.
It is speculated that he may be an opponent for Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at City Hall after Trump took office.
The attendee asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that "it is time for women to go to Washington and improve our shattered government, that is, on the front page as well".
Arrest in LSU Sims shooting.
LA Police in Baton Rouge announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who took place on Friday, has been arrested.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson around 11:00 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They released a video of the Friday shooting, asking for help with the shots to identify the visible man.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and died behind it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday through 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, possessing a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a nearly two-meter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, 10 of them in the starting line-up, averaging 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world championship after team count gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From this point it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday in front of Lewis Hamilton that Mercedes team ranking would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost neglected Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two occasions and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the pit stops and left the back end of the Hamilton group in heavy traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the pit stop a lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went into the lead after being side by side when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free to pass after trying to defend it with a double move on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race from the back row of the grid and was seventh place on his 21-year birthday at the end of the first round.
He then led the race for most of the time, driving in rubber whistles towards the finish and passing Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He eventually drove into the pit stop on lap 44, but failed to increase speed in the final eight laps, which gave Räikkönen fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Valtter did a good job all week and was a real gentleman letting me by.
"The team has done an excellent job of having one of two," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday gathering due to an incident that she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the West Virginia gathering, the president did not address directly the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate at the moment, indicating that people were "bad, disgusting and deceitful".
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and is happening in the Senate for a few days is that you see angry and angry, mean, nasty and lying people," he said.
“ When you look at the press releases and the leaks that you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you leak the document? ” — “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Wait a minute.
Were we leaking... no, we weren't leaking," he added with a senator's look.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein about the charges against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill reported, "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations or leak his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality, and I did so according to his request."
However, his denial was not appropriate for the president, who commented during Saturday’s gathering: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it's one of the worst body languages I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats would use these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power without choosing the means.
You see this meanness and disgust. They don't care who they hurt, who they need to run over to get the power and control of themselves," Mediate told the president.
elite league: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giants' Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
The Dundee Stars defeated the Belfast Giants in a rematch of the Friday elite league, which lost to Dundee 5 : 3.
The Giants took the lead early in the game with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier's goal.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a draw before Dwyer took the Giants to the lead again.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee's standings before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's goals secured their victory.
This was the third loss for Adam Keefe's men in the elite league, and they came to Belfast Friday night to beat Dundeed at 2:1.
This was the fourth match of the half season, of which the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought home team back 13:10 in the rushing first third before Matt Marquardti helped Cownie score a tie goal in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants would lead before the first break, kicking the second goal of their night at the end of the first third.
The home field players regrouped and Bouchard put them back on the level again, batting a numerically overwhelmed minute 27:37 goal.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a lead for the first time at the end of the second third of the game, securing the final third victory in their team's offensive zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four out of the last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
The air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of people from the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami, after which more than 800 people were killed, many of whom have been reported missing.
The area is plagued by strong aftershocks and many people are trapped under ruins in the town of Palu.
Despite colleagues of 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung fleeing the fluctuating air tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, he refused to leave.
She remained on duty to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321 while on the runway.
He then jumped out of the tower, thinking it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We set up a helicopter to transport Kalimantan from Balikpapan to another major hospital in the city.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
“We were extremely sad when we heard about it.” added a spokesperson.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to thousands. According to the state disaster relief agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said: “The death toll may increase because the bodies of many victims are still under ruins and have not been saved. ”
The six-metre waves devastated Palu City, where mass burial is taking place on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “A quick aid brings new sacrifices every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we cannot tell what they might find there.
It is already a tragedy, but the situation may get even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: “I ask you to work night and day to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this?" reported CNN.
The Indonesian city of Lomboki was struck by an earthquake earlier this year, in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugin airline claims one man missing after lagoon plane crash
Although it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane, the airliner now claims that he was driving an aircraft that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia that one man was missing.
Air Niugini said in his statement that as of Saturday afternoon, they were unable to find one male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about the passenger's details, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water upon landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six other passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane ran over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was driving very low when it landed.
‘This is very good,' said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to wade in waist-high water on the sinking plane to an emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin personnel were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head trauma.
The United States Navy and sailors working on a nearby pier also assisted in the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring the people ashore before the plane sank about 30 feet [30 m] underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analyst prepares a schedule for the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor's office ended a retrial of the case on Saturday for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the United States Department of Justice, spent several hours as an expert observer in analyzing intelligence.
He brought out to the jurors how he used cell phone call extracts to recreate the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Brick and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night the maiden died.
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones, indicating that Tellis was with Chambers the night the maiden died, which contradicted the young man's earlier claims.
When records showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, which is why the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stepped into the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in town that day.
When the accusers asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis "wrong because my car was in Nashville".
Another mismatch was that Tellis said he had known Chambers before the maiden's death for about two weeks.
Phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tell deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
‘He erased the girl from her life,' said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to make its court address on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would go to jurors in the later half of the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The Hiphop trio want to fight a negative genre definition by adding positive messages to the music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hiphop has distanced himself from the origins of his political messages and social problem-solving.
They want to go back to the hip hop roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in Britain thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York's nanny is suing a couple for a racist message.
A New York City nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after an accidental message from a family mother in which her mother complained that the nanny was "the next black".
The couple deny that they are racists compared to blackmailing the situation.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her displeasure when she learned that Giselle Maurice, their new laspecare provider, was black when she came to work her first day in 2016.
Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband saying: “EIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII, THE FOLLOWING BLACKYNAHALINE.”
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
The New York Post alleges that the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman, after realizing her blunder, fired Miss Maurice, claiming that their social nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and she had been waiting for a Filipino to take her place.
Miss Maurice was paid for one workday and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice now sues the couple to receive compensation for dismissal, which he wishes to receive on a daily basis in the amount of $350 for the next six months, and the same work he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
‘I want to show them that look, so they do,' he told The Post, adding, ‘I know this is discrimination.'
The couple have rejected the claim that they are racists, saying that ending their employment relationship with Maurice was a sensible act because they feared that after insulting the maiden they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
‘We are not racists,' said the wife's husband, Joel Plasco, to The Post newspaper.
‘But would you give your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was involuntary?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison to extortion, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was in a "very difficult situation".
‘Would you go against someone like that?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case is still under way, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, where they are severely criticized for their behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not relate to the talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of the person who first read it before publication.
It's very fun to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
He said his father, receiving inspiration to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was a punctuated by the death of his father last year.
On Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family", he further added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was quite a quiet man and was not a showy person,” he said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like feeling that your child was accomplishing something: you are proud of them, even though it is not directly your achievement.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice Hospital in Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“They called regularly to say that the daughter’s condition was very bad and that they did not believe she would survive,” Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad, who said that my daughter would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
Soon I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating had started to disappear quietly and leave his system.
He was dead shortly before that, and now all the systems are shutting down.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't howl, scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now mourning her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who knew nothing about her experiences.
"No one knew that," he said.
“I kept my head down, and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outbreak of compassion for Nadi on that flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
The postcards of a grieving woman prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide claws work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have taped cards to the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when she suffered from depression, and 18 when she killed herself.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile would make the whole room shine."
Despite this, he stopped working before he died because he was "in a very bad place with his own."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Ms Davis said, "I'm constantly worried it's having a domino effect."
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with her friend.
Don't shut up – you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner not long after her husband's mother died.
"He didn't say he felt bad or depressed or anything", he said.
“We noticed a change in his behaviour a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point during Christmas Day – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
Ms. Humphreys said that the man’s death was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to cope with it: “It will tear the wound into the entire family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to keep going and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs by a thread while the FBI begins an investigation
"I believed that if we actually got something that he wanted—an investigation of limited time and scope—we might be able to achieve unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "fall together" in the midst of a permanent partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their aversion was due to timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks' time, on November 6, if the Republicans do not do well as expected, they will be severely weakened in their intentions to get the man they want to be the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call the senators while lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the deciding vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors ‘deplete' under Kim's rule
South Korea's legislation has said that the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dwindled since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Harmonization, said that compared to the 2011 defectors (2706), their numbers have decreased last year (1127).
Mr Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China, and a greater number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
A large number of Northern Army runners have been offered South Korean citizenship.
The magazine Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest state border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area located between the two Koreas.
China takes refugees as illegal immigrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back to their homeland by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably over the past few months.
Early this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of the stagnant nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they promised to work broadly towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of sanctions due to lack of progress.
“Unreliable to the United States, our country lacks security security and under such circumstances we are not in any way willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mr. Ri in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said the man was unfit to be a Supreme Court judge
Nancy Pelosi, the opposition leader of the House of Representatives, called Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that the man was temperamentally unfit to serve as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi expressed his opinion in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I inevitably noticed that if a woman had performed in this way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction regarding Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his inaugural speech; describing his family and his high school years, he almost screamed from time to time and remained speechless at times.
He also explicitly condemned members of the Democratic Party on the committee, calling the accusations against him over Hillary Clinton's defeat of the 2016 presidential election as a "grotesque and coordinated reputation killing" organized by angry liberals.
According to Pelosi, he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man was unfit to be a Supreme Court judge, as it showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi remained modest when he was asked if he would try to remove him from office if Kavanaugh were confirmed should the Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I say so much – if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not only fit to be a Supreme Court judge, but he's also not fit to the court where he's currently working," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about the possible decisions against Kavanaugh's Affordable Care Act (Health Act – translator's note) or Roe v. Wade (lawying court precedent of abortion – translator's note) because the man is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical tilted person to become a judge and expect us to say, ‘ Isn’t it great,’ said Pelosi.
And women have to wear it.
It's fair speech, months and years of overwhelming anger, and he can't get away with it without crying.
‘We cry when we get angry,' Ms Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I got help from a woman who was a manager somewhere; she said that she was crying as well as when she got angry, but she developed a method that was that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, “You might think I was crying because I was sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partially accepted as an output of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is of an early job with a majority of men in an office, where I once found myself crying in an indescribable rage when an older woman — a strict leader whom I had always feared — grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Never show them how to cry,” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re furious.
They think you're sad and it gives them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Party congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on the man's presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a yacht called Monkey Business with an extramarital affair and the campaign ended, deeply upset Schroeder thought there was no reason why he should not think of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"Seven candidates were already nominated, and the last thing they needed was for someone else to join."
Someone said it was like Snow White and seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was coming to an end, he was late in fundraising and vowed not to run unless he received a total of $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 to the men, gave him only $250.
‘Do they think I'm getting a discount?' he thought.
When he gave a speech in which he declared that he would not launch an official campaign, feelings of gratitude — gratitude to the people who supported him, irritability for the system, which made it difficult to raise funds and turn to voters instead of delegates, and hatred for sexism — overcame him so much that he had tears in his throat.
‘You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,’ recalled Schroeder’s reaction to the press.
“I would have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they were writing on my tombstone.
"He cried?".
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Help Beijing
The opening blows of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, according to experts, the gap between countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
United States President Donald Trump issued the first warning shot this year, imposing taxes on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs for $200bn (£150bn) worth of goods, essentially imposing taxes on half of the goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has reciprocated each time, the last time with five to ten percent tariffs on $60bn worth of American goods.
China has promised the US a shot-to-shot, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to wink soon.
Getting Washington to retreat would mean yielding to demands, but openly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing does its cards properly, trade war with the US could support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that cause the economy to lose control in another country is in fact far more dangerous than the bystanders have previously admitted," said researcher Abigail Grace, who is focusing on Asian research in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country would improve.
“The situation in the country’s territory is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for refugees who have left the country voluntarily because of terrorism and because of unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN forecasts, 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war that began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the state would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe seizes victory of Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final result of 16.5 vs 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course near Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team received the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Throughout the tournament, U.S. star Phil Mickelson pitched a wing strike on the par-3 track 16 into the water, handing over the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to have achieved a result of 5 : 0 : 0 in the current format of the tournament that started in 1979.
To American Jordan Spieth, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest-placed Dane of the European team, scored 5&4.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, outranked Englishman Ian Poulter by two and one, for whom this Ryder Cup match may have been the last.
Eight veterans of the Ryder Cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the trophy back.
It's about team spirit and I'm glad I could be of help," said emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He passes the torch on to fellow countryman Jon Rahm, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
“I feel extraordinary pride in winning Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup result of 13:21:3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who have won 14 major competition titles, remaining behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend finding fairways; with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the team, U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of the guys, they were courageous.
There were moments in the morning when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought them.
Hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's pull ourselves together, work with America's PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to lift the hat.
They played better than us."
New information on water blooms: concentrations decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report from the Florida Commission on Fisheries and Wildlife (FWC) shows a general decrease in the concentration of flowering algae in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there are reports of more patchy prosperity in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting declining concentrations.
The extent of the water bloom is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
Patches can be found 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but places have decreased compared to last week.
Water flowering has also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County on the coast or offshore, in Hillsborough County from low to high concentrations offshore, in Manatee County from background to high concentrations, in Sarasota County from coastal to high concentrations offshore, in Charlotte County from background to medium concentrations, in Lee County from coastal and offshore from background to high concentrations, and in Collier County from low concentrations.
The counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier continue to receive reports of respiratory irritation.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida during the past week.
