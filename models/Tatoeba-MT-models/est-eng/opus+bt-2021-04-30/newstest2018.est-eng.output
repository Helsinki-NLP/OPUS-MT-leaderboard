Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, the police in Spain detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the court's permission.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
According to the suspicion, they are members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Association between the ages of 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
In Mijas, Malaga, Spain, the alleged leader of a criminal organisation was detained.
Three men were arrested as suspects in Estonia, one of them is the leading figure of a criminal organisation according to data collected and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected suggest that the tasks and roles of the criminal organisation were clearly divided.
The purpose of the criminal association's action was to commit drug crimes and thereby generate criminal revenue", commented the head of the pre-trial criminal case, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in the case in question", added the prosecutor.
These are people who have been among the interests of law enforcement authorities in the past, and some of them have served sentences for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation", Attorney Verte commented.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Service, Ago Leis, said that the detentions were preceded by an investigation lasting nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work materialised and we were simultaneously detained in Estonia and Spain for suspicion of crimes", he said.
Leis added that officials from the Central Criminal Police were instrumental in the detention in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we will get them from the other end of Europe", said Leis.
The information collected so far shows unequivocally that, while at large, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
The man arrested in Spain is expected to be surrendered to Estonia.
As part of this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial criminal proceedings are conducted by the Bureau of Organized Crimes of the Central Criminal Police and run by the State Prosecutorâ€™s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov, then the underworld leader.
Gulevich from Kemerovo rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s, when he became involved in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged monthly roof taxes to businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev criminal organisation, from whom 80 000 euros were seized, or the judgment against nine persons, in 2006, Igor Aleynikov created a criminal organisation aimed at the illegal trafficking of secret cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Ida-Virumaa and South Estonia.
Confiscated criminal proceeds amount to approximately 71,500 euros.
In these criminal cases, the daily exchange of information and evidence with foreign colleagues by police officers and, if necessary, joint action in any country of the European Union has ensured success.
Civil Rights Group warns against travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri about the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The statement by the group states, "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American passengers, visitors and Missourians to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the state, given the whole series of suspicious race-based events that have recently taken place across the state and are also brought out here."
According to the NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning both by the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases concerning discrimination, and by the fact that the targets of state law enforcement are largely unequally targeted by minorities.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are pulled to the edge of the road due to their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri branch, to The Kansas City Star newspaper.
"We've never had such close complaints before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization about the U.S. state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances early this year after he ran out of gas while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report prepared by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that in the state, black motorists' cars are more likely to be stopped 75% than white drivers' cars.
"The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are passing through the state."
Based on the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state 16th in the state's cross-section in terms of the number of similar violations.
A travel warning is also in response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to sue a company in search of housing or work for discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Usually, travel warnings are issued by the State Department about other countries, but recently interest groups have started using this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, may be caused by five different types of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C can develop at a bad rate, which can progress to cirrhosis, or crease of the liver and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, an Epidemiology Adviser to the National Board of Health, says that symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease is the popular name for inflammation of the liver, jaundice.
In children, hepatitis may progress without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation of the liver can only be determined from laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis may change to chronic hepatitis and progress for decades with no symptoms of the disease, which means that you may not know anything about your dangerous liver disease.
Kuulo Kutsar outlines the different forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from the sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the stool of the infected person to the hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth, and using drugs.
The group at risk of hepatitis A infection includes family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with an infected person, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Vaccination can prevent infection, in particular for people who are travelling and who are at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are important: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before food.
Hepatitis B viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of the sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items (dental brushes, shavings), donating blood, having sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a foetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, family members and carers of the sick mother, health workers, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other bodily fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis B diseases.
To prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as persons with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other prevention measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharps and injection needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms in cases of infectious sex, or preventing sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation programme in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of the person affected, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items, donating blood, having sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a foetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, HIV infected persons, and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis C diseases.
Anti-hepatitis C measures include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharps and injection needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms in cases of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
This is why hepatitis D infection is associated with hepatitis B or superinfection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are transmitted by contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringes and needles, sexually transmitted and rarely transmitted from the infected mother to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D are chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who are not immunocompromised for hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people against infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are transmitted by the fecal oral route with drinking water and food, including low-cooked beef, fish and seashells, donor blood, common-use syringes, and from the infected mother to the foetus.
Travellers may become infected with hepatitis E in countries with high illness.
Preventive measures for hepatitis E include hygiene: wash or disinfect your hands after using the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the patient.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-cooked beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Although in the final round the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final draw and won with a time of 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, pulling her husband Tania and children along after the finish.
This was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful", Farah told journalists.
Farah targets a gold double of 5,000 and 10,000 metres running in a row for the fifth title match in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Dam in Gold". The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" is much deeper than the birth story of one of the works of art into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But even more profoundly in history.
An awe-inspiring amount of information could have been used, perhaps by a louder cutlery, a narrower subject would have had more effect on the extraordinary story of the portrait allowed in the title.
It is as if there were two books in one of the covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in Gustav Klimt and her painting "Dam in Gold", and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes to Vienna amidst the bubbling cultural life and who is in the Austrian capital can hardly imagine how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago or how everyone turned their heads in Central's cafe when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see a familiar name in the book, you feel a little more cultured.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where incurable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, does not seem to add anything to the development of the story.
Or perhaps - every pair-phrase brush stroke adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten inhabitants of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married Ferdinand Bloch, a Czech sugar magnate, twice to open up and pose for Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele didn't pull the whole glamorous life she belonged to.
When you look at the Lady in Gold, it's hard to believe that towards the end of life, this noble lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order her husband's portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order at the time cost 4,000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a country house with a good location.
The fact that in some portraits, the master's affair with the model was suspected did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that emerged during the work continued for the rest of their lives.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The Lady in Gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of an extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the work with Adele began, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and investigators believe that the brilliant mosaics of Empress Theodora seen there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented her "Lady in Gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (from 1907 to 1908) another golden painting, "Kissing", was born.
Art historians did not miss the similarity of the two women.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
"I think, in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family's Klimt collection would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had a second portrait of Adele.
Also in her will (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four landscape paintings by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
Her jewelry was bequeathed to her nieces Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the "Austrian Mona Lisa", 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get into the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed to draw.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes seen as the reason that he was not accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria's will, had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find works that were pleasing to the Nazi Party from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Some of Adeleâ€™s work at home was also suitable for Hitlerâ€™s personal art store, but not for Klimtâ€™s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauers began.
At this point, it should only be noted that while "Kissing" sees Belvedere Castle in Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer's depiction of "The Lady's Gold" is to be seen driving to Neue Galerie, New York.
And before you go to Vienna, read the book mentioned above.
Even if you don't plan on going to see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish issues after the book closed than the 135 million-dollar painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait as a family fate story - and a very touching story.
Notably, the Bauer family tree cited at the beginning of the book facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the forward swimming, Gold was very close to his own 200 m back swimming personal record by swimming 2.16.62.
The peak brand dates back to a week ago on a 17-year-old girl when the Canadian Junior Championships received 2.16,58, brokering the Priit Aaviku Swimming Blog.
Gold made it last, or tenth, to the A-finals.
In the finals, he passed the distance with a time of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a powerful new top stamp.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15.13) left Gold apart by just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time ranking, Gold rose to number three, and its new personal top mark is the fifth result of Estonia's all-time.
A young hope for the future is still taking off at the Canadian Adult Championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m free-floating and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold also made successful launches there.
He won the silver medal in the 200 m free swim with a time of 2.03.22.
So quickly this distance was floated by an Estonian woman the last time in 2008.
Only Estonian record woman Elina PartÃµka has swam this distance faster than Gold in Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada also won the bronze medal in the 100 m free swim with an excellent personal record and the top mark of the new Estonian season of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, one year older, has swam this distance just one century faster.
He reached his personal top mark of 100 m on his back when he received a letter of 1.03.69 at the opening turn of the bulletin swim.
At a half-long distance, he only achieved seventh place when swimming 2.17.31 in the final.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season ranking in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth
It's vacation time - that means relaxation for U.S. President Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the most deprived presidents, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president's plan is to spend a 17-day holiday at a golf club in his name in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's holiday began yesterday, Trump's opponents have already spoken for a week about the holiday.
They accuse Trump of resting too often.
Namely, it is customary for the president to spend weekends in his Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush reached a holiday of 67 days with that time, while Barack Obama did half as much as Trump, just 21 days.
But Trump is quick to forget.
Counted days after becoming president, Trump said on the broadcast "60 Minutes" that there would be no time for long vacations during his tenure, as there was a great deal to be done.
He also expressed resentment over Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time, "while Obama is on vacation, plays golf, goes to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS chops the heads off journalists".
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not exactly a relaxation.
Rather, it is officially referred to as working leave, during which Trump has no time to read or engage in other favorite activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working leave.
Namely, the air conditioning system in the west wing of the White House is being replaced and therefore all personnel had to leave.
The Oval Office and other presidential offices are also located in the western wing.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August if there's 38 degrees and no air conditioning", said White House spokesman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work while on leave.
From where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you'll get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not run for state office unless you tolerate voter criticism
Our country's father knew a lot about unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take the newspapers long to beat him up for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
The criticism naturally upset him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken away from us, and in silence and silence we may be led to massacres like sheep".
It brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And early in the week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU for this reason.
The governor's office stamped the lawsuit void, and web commentaries were teeming with counter reactions in the style of "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But that's what counts.
And it matters especially much when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His percentage of approval is ranked second best among the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not an unthinkable reacting stunhead.
He has led the state with firmness and remained strictly firm in his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook quite skillfully as a key tool in dealing with his constituents, for example by presenting his bald head in a lucid fashion for the first time since chemotherapy.
Thus, the Governor's Gazette, which is an official-labeled public forum administered by staff paid by taxpayers' dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people visiting.
In an interview given to The Washington Post, Hogan spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behaviour, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of online abusive Internet trolls, spammers, or angry people.
The Post had a conversation with several real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are, real people who communicate with their chosen managers, teacher, business owner and pastor, not Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not incite anger, but real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote The Post's news story in a commentary novel.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort, rather than admitting that it is a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor's official called a "directed spam attack", others would probably call "public support".
The Facebook era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when, to do the same, workers had to be sent out to collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest protestors and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for making Facebook and other social media outlets toothless.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users, who have blocked him from the Twitter stream.
One of the first landmark judgments on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) after using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During the Washington era, affordable mailing costs had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letter writers beat his way of running.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, destroying Washingtonâ€™s decisions.
According to historical documents collected as part of the online George Washington Letter Collection Project, his cabinet was buried under petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home territory comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European premier Ronan Rafferty hopes for home territory comfort over the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern Irishman, who was leading the final round on the neighboring Archerfield Links trails prior to Paul Eales' downfall last year, has grown fond of the new venue and plays the role of tournament ambassador instead of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club shines in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players see the track in its best form, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done an excellent job of establishing this place.
He is a keen supporter of golf and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This allows the track to be presented excellently."
Englishman Eales looks forward to defending the championship for the first time, although the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It is accompanied by a very special feeling," said the player nesting in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my title at the Extremadura Open because it was stripped of my competitive calendar a year after my victory.
It's magical to come back to this area.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts."
Gary Orr, who joined the seniors' European tour towards the beginning of the year when he turned 50, will return to the competition again on the home ground.
It is his first event in Scotland after participating in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra tension.
I've enjoyed the replay immensely and shown a rather decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things are going so far."
The trio are joined on the field by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in competition fire, the rest of them being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, and parking a car costs Â£5 for a car with one passenger and Â£10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in Indonesiaâ€™s Golden Land
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
He even rarely uses a pot.
In a wooden cottage in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai Regent of the Province of Papua, Indonesia, a housewife places a sweetet called nota in the local language directly upon the fire.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the fire and eaten eagerly with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor with no furniture, and there she also does her daily chores, such as washing her laundry with cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet role is filled by a bucket in a roofless room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband's four wives, she is not assigned to care for any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work, however, can be dangerous most of the village's men are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are also soldiers.
"No one dares to visit after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse into life in the highlands of Papua. It is a former Dutch colony that was merged into Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that caused controversy, in which only 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote in front of the Occupant forces.
The movement, which spurred the Dutch out of supremacy, quickly directed its rage against the Jakarta government, which still keeps the region under strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a remote and deserted place. To get here, you have to fly from Jayapura, the capital of the province, to Nabire for 90 minutes and then take a five-hour journey that makes you nauseous with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs, which have been rendered yellowish - brown in various shades by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, not to mention journalists, nor have foreigners been here at all.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans of Honey Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," Degei says, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse, and bright skirt.
"Before this we only wore leaves of plants on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line, and statistics of infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also an Indonesian land of gold.
Just 100 km away from Pania, a mountainous province roughly the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants, is the largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport excavated about US$3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can be boasted of using wood resources estimated to be worth US$78 billion.
But these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuans, as they result in the stifling presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid approximately US$20 million to local military personnel and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to US$150,000 to one officer.
Papuan efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are mercilessly dealt with.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing in the highlands belonging to Papuan tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 peaceful protesters in the area.
The 2016 report of the archdiocese of Birsbane, "We lose everything" includes testimony to atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victims is hard to count because such incidents occur weekly," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian investigator for the organization Human Rights Watch.
The screws are even more tightly closed because Papuan natural resources have caused the influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demography is changing because of the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from the many Indonesian islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javans' family canteens sell gado-gado with crisp chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papuans," explains Paniais-born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, on behalf of work.
"The Papuan mama-mama [women] will therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is known among the people as Jokowi, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
A former carpenter won 27 of the 29 constituencies of Papua on his way to the Jakarta Presidential Palace, including Paniai.
But Papua has changed very little, and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokowi in anticipation of him fulfilling our hopes regarding restoring justice," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokow took office in October, Paniai suffered a slump.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs at a fire in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from darkness.
The runaway kids told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers took offense at their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, drunken soldiers chased children and beat them with the handles of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated further.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women, and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed a Waita dance of the Papuan honey pago tribe, during which a bird song was run around and imitated.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military.
Upon exacerbating resentment, an order was sent to the soldiers via internal radio. "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," said the official document, which has been seen by TIME magazine but has not been issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame (56) an elder in the district of Kego Koto, the city of Enarotal, perceived the threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"At the turn around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine in his bright colors on a wooden house porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, there was a lot of shots," he adds.
According to a cousin who witnessed his shooting, local man Alfius Youw was hit three times.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes to TIME magazine, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates would only ensure the security of their station as it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with killing," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papua Police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings did not arrive in Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, where he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with abuses in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so it will never happen again in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the crimes against human rights that occurred.
But almost immediately there were also excuses.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, however, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said that "everything will be resolved by law".
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been solved in Papua, including what happened in Paniai.
The families of Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I have been interrogated four times over the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to dissect the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in the neighboring Regent of Paniai, Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when going into a fight between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This male, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the policemen, upon which the latter responded with warning shots.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, afraid of revenge," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii to TIME magazine, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the entry of the injured.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and the withdrawal of the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the tribes of honey, moni, dan and damal living in the lands of the central highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papuan Movement (VPL) rebel army, which claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by occasional attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's frontrunners are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "protecting the sovereignty of the state", the military has arrested Paniais and arbitrarily detained thousands of people over the last few years.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as the "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive to buy for the locals.
Bread is just as unattainable.
People grow all their food on their own mainly sweet potatoes, along with a little fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each able to maintain four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually hold most of the harvest for the family, while the rest are selling in the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between the indigenous Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived to a large extent since the opening of the new routes to Nabire Airport, has deepened.
These few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans themselves often lack the capital or skills needed to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying over because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, tough restrictions remain on foreign media.
Towards the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua as "they did not follow the relevant practices", although they had been given a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of Asia Department of Human Rights Watch, Jokow's election promises to lift restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"Indonesia, journalists trying to report from Papua's most troubled provinces in the east and from West Papua are threatened by new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of the press's drilling gaze means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states spurred Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to investigate "multiple large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically also supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir dismissed the allegations of the group, telling journalists in Jakarta, "Democratic order and freedom of the press still apply in Indonesia, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of anti-human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the official Dutch delegation, led by the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who had attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will be held in Indonesia in 2019, but Papuans do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know that, in addition to constantly living under the threat of predatory military, Paniai people are struggling in misery because of poor educational and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, regard the voice given to his Jokow as a debt he will have to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims were able to cope with the last symbolic insurgency they buried the body of one of the victims in the land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
The Dubai Torch skyscraper has been swallowed up by fire twice.
The fire ran through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from this 337-meter-high and 79-story building.
This is the second fire that has devastated a tall building that happens to be called the Torch, or Torch Tower, in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up to a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident called himself George told Reuters.
According to Dubai civil defence officials, firefighters extinguished the flame at about 4:00 a.m. local time left (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may again raise questions around the world about the safety of materials used on the surface of high-rises.
An investigation conducted by the Torch Board in the wake of the fire in 2015 found that the facade cover suffered the most damage - decorative panels and insulation of the exterior.
British police have said they believe that London's Grenfell Tower insulation and faÃ§ade panels may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that operated there in June, in which approximately 80 people died.
Look, these phones are probably gonna be hit-and-run in the fall.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will publicize their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came on sale, and new hit phones are also expected for store stalls in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, the marketing and sales director of Tele2, this yearâ€™s flagships are characterised by an innovative design, an eye-iron scanner, a 4K resolution screen and an ultra-fast processor.
The technology world Samsung Galaxy S8 was very excited, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales chart.
Autumn allows even faster fast charging, more durable battery, better quality camera and greater water and dust resistance for smart enthusiasts.
He added that it is already possible to make assumptions and predict the four top models that will probably capture this year's sales charts.
These four top models of smartphones will still reach the storelets in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the storelets as early as mid-September.
Rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it spread a lot.
While iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences alongside iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to make a new model completely different from the previous ones.
Four colours have been spoken: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire phone's front panel, a home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built inside the screen.
Apple's design manager JonyIve insists that the new iPhone model look like smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye-iron scanner, wireless charging and an even higher-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
I'm sure it's one of the year's most anticipated smartphones.
Pre-order of the brand new model Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There's been a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is said that even more business users are meant and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrower view of the TV lens.
At present, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable in quality to iPhone 8.
We're looking forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has brought up for sale three smartphones this year, led by Nokia 6, their flagship is still missing - Nokia 8, which will be presented as early as 16 August.
We expect a 5.3-inch-to-edge screen and a very fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery from Nokia.
In Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, with optics produced by Zeiss.
If Sony's firm flagship has so far been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is slightly more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with the same or better camera.
It has been speculated about Sony's new model that its screen will be at least six inches.
What is real is that we will soon see that Sony has traditionally unveiled its flagship in autumn at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico on paying for the border wall
The Washington Post publicized transcripts of phone calls between United States President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian state leaders.
On January 27, Trump telephoned Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop the latter public declaring that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president scolded him for publicly condemning the wall, saying, "You can't say this to the press."
Trump erected his presidential campaign on the promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States would take on refugees heading to Australia would be "ridiculous", "stupid" and "stupid." He claimed that the agreement made during Obama's government would make him look like a "dumb" as he has proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the speech by informing Turnbull that "the doing was the day's most unpleasant speech".
The Supreme Court did not consider the complaint of OÃœ MRP Linna Lines in a case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of bus and coach services from July 2019 until 2029.
This is a decree rejecting OÃœ MRP Linna Linna Linesâ€™ bid at Tartu bus procurement because the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is the procurement of public bus service within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP Linna Lines appealed to the Supreme Court the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not take it into consideration.
Although on social media many complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their sleep and the whole city is full of drunken partyers, there are also many who have no bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the party at the store was so polite!
I didn't see any hazyness or rudeness.
Even I saw kindness", says the monkey Wave.
"It's great that people come, they are and enjoy PÃ¤rnu, which has wintered like hibernation", he adds cheerfully.
The blunder from the beach does not disturb the sleep of the Wave.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, now the music has not yet reached his home level.
"But I hope I do", he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who spoke with Ã•htuleht, also says that the grand festival is rather good for PÃ¤rnu â€“ it helps the turnover of local merchants.
He also rejoices that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
You don't disturb a party girl.
Even though I don't tan on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach's been alive.
And it's nice that people are moving and it's already been that way three times", says the woman.
It must have been a little worse the first time.
"Then perhaps there were complaints", he ponders.
But according to him, the rumble on the beach is common for the summer townspeople.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town", says Harri, a pesky in the park.
Mell and commotion have not shaken his rhythm of life either.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interethnic interaction would be better.
Loud music doesn't crush a man.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live right there.
"Good people can stick together and there's no trouble", he says.
The guests who have come to PÃ¤rnu say they are polite.
"They have, of course, exaggerated a little bit with bottles, but the young are young and the Lord God - let go, but be human and we will manage!" he says.
Beachside residents have traveled away by then, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of commotion", says Tiina, who walked with children in PÃ¤rnu.
The festival music does not disturb his familyâ€™s sleep either, although last year it sounded even further than this year.
Last summer the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, that it actually sounds quite good to the far PÃ¤rnu river", he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revive the business
British education company Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividend by 72 percent, thus launching another restructuring programme to address the business's threatening distress.
The job losses, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will most likely be concentrated at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by an additional Â£300 million (US$394 million) under the third cost reduction program to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said that their expectations regarding the year had not changed since a 1-percent increase in sales revenue was announced to Â£2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber in Kabul near the Iraqi embassy killed two people.
A NATO statement said that a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "human-bearing self-made explosive device".
The statement claims that all injured are in stable condition and are being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the growing force of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) is a serious source of concern for the forces in the NATO Bagram in Qarabagh.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people mainly in Shiites district.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a major bomb attack killed more than 150 people in the city centre - this has resulted in the most deaths from a military attack in the country since the US-led forces repulsed the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while United States President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country's military and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA overturned decision to postpone smog order after lawsuits
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturned the decision to delay the introduction of an Obama-era regulation obliging states to limit exhaust emissions causing smog, one day after 15 states sued the agency due to this move.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed with the "2015 ozone-determining operations" late Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to cooperating with the states.
"We believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June EPA's intention to postpone ozone determinations by measuring smog pollution in various parts of the country to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 to meet the stricter air quality standard.
Fifteen predominantly Democratic states filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying that the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has been trying to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama.[citation needed] According to Trump, this is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost economic growth.
But these efforts have produced counter-reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of ozone-containing air "could reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of respiratory disease", such as asthma.
German pigs could have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a feast because heavy rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be that weeks of rainy seasons before harvesting can mean that crops for the bread industry are only suitable for feeding to animals.
"The quality of the wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015", said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst for Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go into animal feed, which is double that of conventional wheat, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First of all, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heat wave.
In July, Germany was hit by a series of rain attacks, which has continued into August as well.
The eyes of many have been turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not even begun harvesting yet, reported local harvest collector Ceravis.
"It's a pretty complicated day", said Frank Deckert, Ceravis' senior merchant from Rendsburg.
Coherence in all things, or the clever deformities of the Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fairhouses, as through large windows, the magnificent views of Saimaa shoreline reach many (life) rooms.
Each step is marked by our northern neighboursâ€™ efforts to create both crisp and perfect (energy-efficient) homes.
It is worth admiring and also observing Finnsâ€™ use of wood as building and finishing materials, making furniture and beauty items.
The builder and (home) designer can find exhilarating techniques and smart solutions in the fairhouses.
It clearly shows that the shades of black, white and grey, when supplemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, as the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
This week's Weekend Festival Baltic was brought down on the night against today and Martin Garrix gave his best shot at the main stage to remember as the last performer.
During Garrix's performance, the crowd was really upset - singing, hollering, dancing self-absorbed.
When Garrix finished, a common mass was spilled from PÃ¤rnu beach to the city.
Let's bring you a gallery with all the pictures our photographer captured on the Weekend in three days.
Surely you are in some of them too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face each other in the most appealing boxing match in the near future up to 66.7 kg weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the featherweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
Following Garcia's unanimous decision to win over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are included in the top five of the weights table.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for the photographs, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas stated that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a "perfect measure".
"I'm former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up to [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move below lightweight.
And he has to move up the lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
It's what the fans have wanted.
Let us then offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing world needs this fight".
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch. It is part of his strategy to have Lomachenko debut in the 61.2 kg class later this year to make it possible to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match after their Lightweight Round Forum on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be paid because fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia later said, saying he would be open to fighting on any channel offering the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia says he considers Lomachenko a "powerful fighter" and may go to watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that in his mind, the master of the three divisions from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey...you wished for this knockout".
According to Garcia, the goal was to show impact strength and then box.
Both confirmed that they could feel the tension growing to make them more prosperous.
"It's a fight waiting to be realized.
No other confrontation creates so much attention and buzzing.
I am more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey has just that.
It's going to be a good fight."
Which corners of the world will be moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals, who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, last year the decision was made to issue a fixed-term residence permit to 6702 foreigners, while the figure was 4928.
The authorities cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year, but in recent years this figure is beginning to close to 2000.
The number of residence permit applicants increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis â€“ in 2014, 1,087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the largest increase is in the number of Ukrainian citizens â€“ 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that people are looking for jobs and opportunities to study in a country where the community and many families are already ahead", stated Kristin Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the total number of temporary residence permits issued to the latter was the highest in ten years.
When Ukrainians come here mostly to work, Russian citizens for family migration.
"Considering the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia", said Helina Maasing, migration researcher at the Academy of Internal Defence.
"When looking at where Russian citizens who have received the Estonian residence permit have moved, there is Ida-Virumaa right after Harjumaa", he added and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased.
"The delay is due to the fact that a new residence permit has been applied for to settle permanently in Estonia instead of the extension of the residence permit", explained Rammus, a spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, according to whom the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has been rather stable for years.
To settle permanently in Estonia, foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit from the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage the stay of adapted people.
However, a long-term residentâ€™s residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased due to the new residence permit.
Last year, for example, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state will stop fingering whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular - the applicants last year were holders of grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people were granted residence permits to settle in Estonia, including, for example, 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
With the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 were issued last year.
They come from Nigeria to study at the universities here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely due to the learning mobility.
For them, too, the rule is that where a community has emerged, there will be more people there easier", added Rammus.
In the course of ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive residence permits per year, it is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even with the addition of European Union citizens, migration remains at about a percentage", Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to the statistics office, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia last year, while 13,792 moved out.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year.
Most of the people who move and move are Estonian citizens, but more of them are among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens with 2000 people was negative last year.
Estonians mostly travel between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion charms with sats, embroidery and tulle
The Northless Ark of Ideas is, however, history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream somewhere in the museum for hours and admire old sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, you will study and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
Mammu Couture's glamorous world may seem a stranger to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine there is in your life!
I have a friend with a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I created.
Because it's not her fault she doesn't live in Hollywood and go on the red carpet every day, she wants to wear those most beautiful dresses and she does!
You can live your own life as special!
The fashion artist does not admit the gap between shining events and gray weekday.
It was this thought that led to the plan to move the high fashion to rural areas, between forests and fields in Estonia, to people to whom fashion often fails.
Mammuâ€™s collection was presented in VÃµru, JÃµhvi and PÃ¤rnu fashion halls, where the royal de fillies filled the entire street with 45 models.
People in Tallinn often take a pose, nod with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere â€“ they shout bravo, stand up, want to thank you by the hand.
A lot of the audience just came to see you, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they will be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion.
In PÃ¤rnu, we had a 50 metre long red carpet with beautiful dresses all over the street, and it seemed that they were never going to end!
Maria also does not recognize the fashionable practice that the creation must be presented by a supersale supermodel, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
Often I invite my own clients to the stage - they've always been happy to come.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my own show, I'm always backstage to give things a final touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to watch the hall.
Maria is the type of fashion designer who not only wants to play the role of representative, but wants to be in everything by the hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I perform myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not about design, it's about stylistics, logistics, organizing, organizing - everything has to fit into one temperamental woman's day.
That's a lot of working hours for fanatics.
I can't tell when my day at work ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and yet yet compliments.
How many times has it been said that there's magic in my dresses - they make you feel like a princess.
The plentiful tulle satsirades that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin MÃ¼Ã¼rsepp of the U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian sub-group tournament has now been turned against us
I'm sorry. I'm out of fairy tale.
The first thing I noticed was we didn't get our table.
And if there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to do", commented Martin MÃ¼Ã¼rsepp, the only basketball player who played for Great Britain in the NBA, the assistant coach of BC Kalev/Cramo.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attacking table and received so many more attacks as a result.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many attacks by the British ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up defenses.
In defense, however, they managed to keep their hands in each place, we could not combine.
It kicked the team's ass.
The opposite's homework was better done.
According to the masonâ€™s assessment, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to cut off the momentum of its opponents.
In the last quarter - we had a zero error, but the opponents already had several quick baskets.
Athleticism and intense insistence, which was our weapon at the sub-group tournament, now all turned against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tassi.
At the tournament in general, good words can be said about the entire team, to this day there was a single strike fist.
It's a shame you haven't met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been confident and still played its way out today, but it seemed he was tired - he's been carrying quite a burden.
But he made some pretty moves I've seen in practice before", the supervisor added.
Horrible numbers: The women's basketball team threw three quarters less than 10 points in the EM tournament...
In the U18 age class not only the men's EM B division basketball tournament takes place in Tallinn, the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
Unfortunately, Estoniaâ€™s game with Poland was in the area of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter the score was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes did opponents take their foot off the gas pedal and that period was a draw of 16:16.
In the first and second quarter, Estonia scored 4, 3rd 1 point...
In the first two minutes of the first four throws, the Estonian women hit two in the first two minutes, then 25 in the second, then one in three and then 21 in the second.
Perhaps within almost half an hour, 47 throws were caught one.
In addition, 2 points came from four free throws.
There was a reasonable number of ball losses in that time, 12.
By the end of the match, Poland had 33th and Estonia had 13th percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses; on the opening day it had to admit the betterment of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today NATOâ€™s 1st Permanent Mines Control Group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit over the weekend in order to replenish the shipsâ€™ supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare for the sea and give crew members the opportunity to take a few daysâ€™ rest.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to conduct several exercises and be ready for future historical explosive search operations.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation training in local waters illustrates our integration with the Allied forces", said Commander of the Operations and Planning Division, Commander Arto Rhineland, who is in charge of the Naval Fleet Commander.
From 29 June, the 1st NATO Permanent Mines Control Group will be led by the Latvian Navy Lieutenant General Gvido Laudups, who took over the functions of Group Commander from the Estonian Navy officer Lieutenant General Johan-Elias of Seljamaa at a ceremony held in Riga.
The group's flagship is the Latvian naval support ship LVNS Virsatis, which also operates the group's flagship headquarters.
In this semester, the international unit also includes the Estonian Navy's minehunter Sakala.
As one of the four groups of ships under NATO's naval command, NATO's 1st Permanent Mines Control Group is a ready-to-use unit of the primary rapid response team, which the alliance can send to various parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was implemented 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klas, is held.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joost (36), artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic.
Risto Joost: The classics of the opera world include Traviata and Tosca, ballet performances from the captivating Bolero to the fun "Karlsson" and there is no lack of self-production, which is the production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorium "Years" by the same international creative team, who in 2015 brought to the stage the second masterpiece "Creation" of Haydn.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical performances.
It's bigger than any musical theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose fascination takes over and never quite lets go again.
Because the experience that the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human souls ring and touches human perceptions in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the first year artistic director of the Birgitta Festival.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klas' shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it's been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my career as a conductor.
Maybe that's why it makes it easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it will be transferred to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was the great heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year's festival that you offer in particular?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgrenâ€™s account will be presented.
It's "Karlsson flies."
And one of the curious nuances is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
She must have had Karlsson's character in her soul since she was a child.
Risto, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
Such work requires a support system and much love, and I am fortunate to have plenty of it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend as much on other people as I do on myself, or how I'm going to face every new day.
And this kind of conscious tone-holding, positivity-keeping, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, greatly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially this week, when the most important samples are, I've been particularly busy practicing it and it's working.
Smiling for yourself activates the brain and raises tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people don't know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but they'll discover it gradually.
Now, here's the big moment.
Do you have any ritual before you step into the conductor's remote?
Sure, you have to change your clothes for more comfortable ones.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But, in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or take a nap before a big performance.
In fact, I actually like to communicate actively with people, even before entering the conductor's remote.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover for not a very big opera and ballet friend!
Watch a lively video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers, during which their age was medically assessed with an innovative approach. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started testing this year.
The tests were created for a more accurate assessment of age during the process of applying for asylum after the Swedish Migration Office (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly underage refugees.
To date, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated as 18 years of age or older, and in a further 25 cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the testable "could be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is "probably younger than 18".
Tests are only used if a personâ€™s age is questioned.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued the results of 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person being studied is 18 years of age or older".
But when Svenska Dagbladet, a newspaper, examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases, the person had directly claimed that he would turn 18 this year.
This medical method of age assessment, in which wisdom - toothed x - ray images and knee - joint MRI are made, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some districts.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about it and I don't think the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the newspaper Metro.
But Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of disabling a child inaccurately into adulthood is low.
The highest risk, or about 10%, is if a person is just under 18."

The 20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at London's MM, getting an 18th-place finish with 67.37.
Orel was MMâ€™s youngest female hammer thrower, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for the medals in the future.
The race went well and I got a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80) I immediately did my average score, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear", Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's ML debut ended in a good 18th-place finish.
The rain didn't bother Orel because he's training winter through TUT Stadium.
"I'm hardened," he said with a little smile.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel sense people around him or was he able to turn himself off?
I sensed it, but in a positive way.
Everybody says it's gonna give us more, that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with the ML's debut and there are many more good competitions waiting for him: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
That's a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and MMil - that's all that matters.
I bring along a good experience, and some days I want to compete for medals.
West Virginia governor announced party change
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at a gathering Thursday night with President Trump that he would switch parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought over a great deal... today I say to you Western Virginians that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
At the gathering, cheers erupted.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had promised a major announcement at an earlier West Virginia gathering.
Trump won by 42 points in West Virginia, and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, the only billionaire in the state, turned out to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
Its value is approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an announcement on Thursday night that "the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from being made better again than working for it".
"Of only 15 governor seats and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is just the most recent rejection for a party that is run from end to end and unable to find a positive and unifying message," RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there's a lot of people, there's a lot of injured people.
Urmet, a member of the Weekend Medical Tent, told the Evening News yesterday that they had to hand out quite a lot of patches.
Wools and abrasions are basic, twists and slight falls.
And, of course, headaches, back pains and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and so the problems come.
Medics have also had to assist visitors with a couple of major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also a broken leg.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll do the little stitches here, send the bigger ones to the hospital.
Check the video to see if celebratory medics are asking for painkillers to treat hangovers.
Coe praised the Russians' honest apology for the doping scandal.
Athletics international frontman Sebastian Coe praised, according to his words, "Russia's four-day honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country back to sport.
Russian quarterback Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the ban on competition imposed on his country was correct and that he had the firm goal of fighting doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who have been stripped of the gold and silver medals in the competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to leave in force the competitive ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told journalists.
"The Healthy Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian under-union also admitted themselves that they have had rather difficult times and are doing everything possible to restructure the under-union."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for reinstating itself.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always adhered to the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF Task Force, said Monday that Russia did not yet meet several criteria for reinstatement.
After a presentation to the Council of the IAAF, he told journalists in London that doping control was still inadequate and that the banned coaches were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution significantly change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mine giants like Glencore can say they win from one place and lose from the other, smaller mining companies won't help.
Glencore currently serves from coal and oil, but in the age of electric cars, demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will increase.
This year, the decisions of the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels have raised their stakes in the spread of electric cars.
Volvo has therefore already known that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that electric cars will be sold more than cars using oil-derived fuels for two decades.
"For some metals, it changes everything", said Simona Gambranini Bloomberg, a raw material analyst for Capital Economics.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has been growing for years.
Electric cars have about three times as much copper as the conventional car, Glencore reported.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase demand for copper by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore receives revenue from the growing trend in electric cars from copper price increases and being the world's largest cobalt producer, predicted by the Jefferies Group.
This brokerage company estimates that the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Exchange has been costing 70 percent.
Last year's price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also risen by 14% this year, mainly because of economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose 20 percent in London, having surpassed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American in price increases.
On the losing side are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, who have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is batteries supplying the starters for petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found for it that could overcome the fall in demand", said Michael Widmer, head of analysis for the metal market at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Lead in the form of price movement has yet to be noticed the effect of the unfolding trend.
Lead has risen by 17 per cent this year, the best metal in London in terms of price increases for the main industrial metals.
Investors see problems with metal only far in the future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars in competition", said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager for the metal brokerage company Triland Metals.
When the demand for lead drops, it happens slowly.
Maybe that's what's gonna happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, however, stricter emission standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, dependent on advanced lead-based batteries at frequent engine start-up, will be assessed by an international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive farther with less electricity.
This explains the additional demand of 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium between 2013 and 2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the world's total production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to deepen, said Widmer.
Aluminium has risen 13 per cent this year as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to market shortages.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce lightweight car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop lighter alloy steel to resist aluminum.
"Super-strong steel should be the answer to this development", said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this was spent as catalysts for diesel-powered cars of precious metal, reported metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many of the currently high-demand raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have high-demand in the future", said Bernard Dahdah, a Natixis raw material analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance changes within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, the leader of Uncore, said that more hybrid cars than full electric cars would continue to be sold in 2025.
The great hope for platinum manufacturers in a 10-year perspective is developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos on hydrogen cell-based cars dependent on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet commercially justified itself.
"Diesel seems to have a clear loser on his way to electric cars", said Exane BNP of Paribas, Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July, as the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world-record transition from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still ahead of Paris Saint-Germain.
The Fair Play Financial Rules (FFP) established by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid â‚¬222 million ($262 million) solely to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary begins to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transition to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to raise this kind of money to recruit Neymar and add it to its star-rich lineup, given that the team is funded by the family ruling Qatar's energy rich.
Clubs are allowed to spend plenty to recruit players, but they must balance it with legal sources of income allowing them to come up with their own in the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs who fall into heavy debt in search of success would actually engage in cheating and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners had to give up support.
As of 2011, FFP focuses on tracking their losses instead of debts to clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then to make huge expenses to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of the FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs may incur losses of up to â‚¬30 million.
And despite Platini's disgraced emancipation from presidential office in 2015, his UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso told The Associated Press last week, who is the supervisor of the FFP in UEFA.
Although Neymarâ€™s purchase clause was paid by PSG as a single full payment, it is possible for them to split this amount into tranches for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract, making it possible to show the transitional fee at EUR 44,4 million per year over the next five years.
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, received the most severe penalties.
PSG was fined â‚¬60 million (at that point $82 million), which was later reduced to â‚¬20 million, and the club was required to restrict the Champions League team for the 2014-2015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to outwit regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies affiliated with club owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the sponsorship value is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as an official income.
This happened in 2014 when UEFA determined that the value of the support from Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was overblown.
It has been said that a certain portion of Neymar's PSG service may come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Championships Management Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador for the World Championships, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant regarding any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transition proactively with the PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG.
The most recent reports show that PSG made a profit of more than EUR 10 million in the 2015-2016 season at a turnover of around EUR 542,4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a good effect on sponsorship deals, commercialization and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30 per cent in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar's transition by claiming that the PSG would thereby violate the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the country," said La Liga president Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, citing that the PSG is primarily owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's attitude that the state funds the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the past 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the country may have other ways or other interests for such a great player to represent the country."

Today 50 years ago: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which on August 6 and 7 caused major damage, especially to LÃ¤Ã¤nemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
During these days, the wind speed in northwestern Estonia was more than 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree in the garden to another and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and raging, like the end of the world.
Roofs were already flying from houses on the ground, in 2002, Old Lady Linda Kurova recalled Haapsalu magazine Eesti Loodus in an interview.
Lindaâ€™s husband saw the garden he planted collapse.
But what are you gonna do with your hands on the trees where you're gonna get against a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, water splashed in the windows", said Mrs Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the platform roof of the railway station had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda saw only the next morning like most Haapsaluns.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were on the ground, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through the beautiful old trees with a crack and crack like a war.
LÃ¤Ã¤ne-Viru County did not suffer particularly badly in the August storm of 1967 compared to LÃ¤Ã¤ne-Eesti, but the damage was also great there, wrote the Virumaa Journal in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped off the face of the earth, but the parks in our area were also badly damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speed was measured at up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
On August 6th, a little girl called out in MerivÃ¤lja, Tallinn, "Mom, Mom!
Chickens are in the air and can't get down anymore!"", wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The PÃµlli Manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm to such an extent that it was later decided to demolish it.
The constructions of TÃ¼ri ski jumping hill, which were not rebuilt later, did not survive the August storm.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star newspaper wrote that the cleanup of towns and settlements from fallen trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could participate in the cleaning work.
Crop fields were also badly damaged in the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party early organizations must be both instigators and guides in the organization and in the harvesting of grain".
Hurricanes can be spoken of when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The wind record in Estonia stands from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu measured the wind speed at 48 m/s.
On Vaindloo Island, a measuring device was broken, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning and poor beach weather
The colder summer weather also means a smaller harvest in Tallinnâ€™s bathing areas.
"If it's weather, people are on the beach, and if it isn't, there are no people", says the beach janitor.
Seagulls cry out on Stroom beach in North-Tallinn.
They are faced with melodic competition from a low-wing tractor that ploughs stripes on the platform.
In fact, the latter sifts through seven centimetres of sand, picking out sea debris and peopleâ€™s leftover waste: bottle caps, cigarette butts, and so on.
People still come to the beach whether the water is warm or not.
If it is beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if it is not, there are no people", says Alexander Usov, the manager of the Haabersti Management company's beach cleaning work.
It's 6:30 a.m., and we're doing a rough cleaning job on the beach, 'cause at 8:00 a.m., people have to be fine.
Usov's on duty at 4:00.
In addition to Stroom, he will keep an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, KakumÃ¤e and Pikakar beach.
There's been a decrease in the amount of garbage.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them", says Usov, who has been clearing beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new was set up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're holding what's on the beach.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on the Estonian beaches is cleaning the sea debris, or adru, washed ashore.
For example, at Pirita Beach, 400,000 tons of it must be transported to the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount", notes Usov.
Another major category is domestic garbage, or all that people leave behind.
The one - and - a - half - mile [1.5 km] Stroom Beach strip has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
That's how much garbage is generated.
However, colder summer weathers have meant that garbage is a fifth less than usual.
The third species is made up of abandoned things.
They're mostly children's stories.
This time, Usov has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They will wait for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
Usov already knows that he will soon find them again in the sand.
The children come to the beach and take the toys to drown them again in the sand.
Dismantling Trash
Erika Scholler, representative of Haaberst's administrative services, admits that the tractor screening work is disrupted by locals.
The noise, which lasts from night hours to early morning, interferes with the sleep of the people in the neighborhood.
During the day, however, this work is impossible.
One month, the beach must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us", notes Scholler.
However, like Pirita, Pikakar and PÃ¤rnu, the aim is to get Stroom Beach under the international Blue Flag quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained", says Scholler.
We have more plows and rocks and more difficulty sifting the sand.
However, there is less garbage on our beaches than in other parts of Europe.
Upon hearing that garbage is being talked about on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroom Beach, uncompulsoredly joins the conversation circle between journalist and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a nasty picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with the birds and bottle pickers who have pulled the garbage bags inside out", reports Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their current behaviors, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about trash cans and put on lids, for example, to prevent birds from checking in.
Overall, however, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroom Beach.
You can see the city's taking care of it.
With children's playgrounds, enlightened and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It was once the case that only one road could be driven on roller skates", notes Martin.
Treasure Hunter's Findings in the Stroma: Coins, Coins Only
A 40-year-old Dimitri, who combs the beachside with a metal detector as a treasure hunter, has come to take advantage of the morning low tide.
He does not believe that he will find anything precious today or in the future.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough to do so.
"I've been doing this for a year and haven't found anything valuable so far," says Dmitri.
As a bicyclist hunter, Dmitri has some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails in his treasure bag, which later throws into the trash.
There's usually coins.
"There is usually no gold, no rings, and nothing like that," states the treasure hunter.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as the tight incomes of households have put interest rates on hold.
Policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep the 6:2 rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that pressure on household incomes would persist as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank indicated that the increase in rates over the next few years would be necessary to contain the inflation caused by Brexit and that in financial markets a higher increase in credit costs than expected may be necessary.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
In February, the bank will end a fixed-term funding scheme that provides cheap funding to banks, although it said that a Â£15 billion increase in supply is now expected under this scheme, which is Â£115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says, "In the medium-term forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
On the rates, it was repeated that a "sweeping of monetary policy" was necessary to alleviate inflation, and to a "some extent" greater than expected in the markets.
The stock exchange is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for a 1.8 per cent increase in 2018 remained.
After this news, the pound's exchange rate dropped against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to US$1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have dampened the growing expectations due to the rise in GDP in the second quarter, which rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it is beginning to pick up a bit.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for rejoicing to households suffering from rising inflation and wretched wage increases, saying that the situation would get a little worse before it improved.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a blow to income in the next few years, but a marked return in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision comes a year after rates were moved to 0.25% last August after a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to suddenly weaken.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully inflate prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for an increase in the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in distress; in July, three policy makers demanded an increase of the rate to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although according to the bank this was expected and a rise is expected again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excessive increase compared to the 2-percent target was entirely due to a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said, "In light of the recent drop in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again as lenders crave work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock market seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are beginning to come to an end, as refinancing, often at no service charges and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is writing out 10,000 people for controversial HIV drugs
Patients have access to "transformative" HIV preventative treatment since September after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that public health now makes an estimated 10,000 people available pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) tablets before intercourse, which have shown a reduction of about 86% in the risk of infection in high-risk individuals during the initial three-year clinical trial.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's ruling last year that the NHS would be able to pay for the PrEP, despite the agency's own claims that the drug should be financed instead by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, the executive director of NHS England, welcomed this publicized move on Thursday as "a new comprehensive intervention", while the National AIDS Foundation (NAT) described it as a "turny moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register. In October, more clinics will be added before the program is introduced anywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in your body to prevent infection with HIV.
These medicines can be taken every day or two hours before intercourse at the latest.
Candidates eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not undergoing treatment.
Clinicians identify suitable individuals who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner is not receiving antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register at the local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program will cost Â£10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who the medicinal product is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in large size.
Stevens said, "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is yet another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of mankind's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, NAT's executive director, said, "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted correctly for those who need it and are at risk, offers the opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access through this NHS-funded clinical trial to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and independent of negotiations with a partner, thus improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive officer of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said "It is now crucial to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is pushed forward quickly and that none of those at risk for HIV remain excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow minister for public health, said "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and well delayed after months of delays and dragging the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to the prevention of HIV and to the end of its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial be introduced across the country as soon as possible to protect people with HIV exposure and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity prices increased by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania they fell.
In July, the difference in the price of the next dayâ€™s electricity exchange between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
The average exchange price of electricity in Estonia was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month and the price increased by 12% compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the Nord Pool power exchange was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 percent and seven percent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75 per cent of last monthâ€™s hours towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place in the next day's deals.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 percent of the hours had total transmission capacity in use.
According to transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the exchange price of electricity in August may be around 34 euros per megawatt-hour and in September 37 euros per megawatt-hour.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the electricity production price increased last month and transactions were made at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living a high life - a half-floor and smart design tips have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate updater, traded her large Knightsbridge home in 2014 for an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my former life partner in Knightsbridge on much larger ground," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something equal to the price I was offering.
I was shown this apartment at Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since its first visit, this 93-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete upgrade course.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - to reach the bedroom you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half - floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wished for high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Duck & Shed, an architectural and design studio operating in Notting Hill, Erfan Azadi, to take advantage of the 3.8 m tall ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where one could stand upright.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would be placed on top of each other without having to bend over.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure to make the height of both the upper and lower spaces correct."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms on top of each other in the room, with plenty of dramatic elements.
A view of the glamorous living space below opens from the half-story with old copper light from the Retrouvius window.
Golden furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and a retro-housing Serge Mouille luminaire emphasizes the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and luminosity.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the rear wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers storage for all Joanne's utensils and glassware.
The living room is given the opportunity to close the kitchen when it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
This kitchen, however, is unique in that it is a garage-type lifting door.
"There was a bit of a design problem," Erfan explains the door of the MDF, which was veneered with steel reinforcement.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"By the end of the line, the floor is what you sell - or what gives the property value," Erfan says.
"Real estate broker steps into room in outdated form and makes calculations based on floor area".
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are what you touch and thus help to make an emotional connection with the home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart's tongues ring."
This shows that a good design and increased area help to make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they could make you want not to leave, just like Joanne did.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago skyscraper-acting bounty hunter who competes with a colleague for promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money that is earned, along with any ethics that is forgotten.
Only early in the morning and late in the evening does a man see his wife and three children.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself thinking it's the business world version of The Cardhouse - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler are like the speech mane.
As the film goes on, the lower the frame-house element will be, and the moralistic intent of the filmmakers will become more and more apparent.
A life-changing experience becomes the protagonist's son getting cancer.
The choice now has to be made between work and family life.
A son who dreams of being an architect makes his father walk to Chicago's great buildings to think about really important things, such as faith, goodness, love... and not even the disaster of the twin towers.
After the third scene, in which the son opens his father's eyes, the filmmakers feel that the goal is to get the audience to cry, because even the viewer with the coldest heart is unable to hold back the tears in the sight of the suffering of a beloved cancer boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally realizes the morale of his work and does a good deed to an old man seeking a job.
Now I bet on myself in my mind - if the film has a happy self, I'll reward my perceptiveness after the film with coffee, but if I'm wrong, then the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment there's a suspicion that I'm going to lose my coffee... when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes down the hall to the room in slow motion.
Rather, the son has been miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive because it is now time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of American drama pretty well!
In honor of the truth, the film is well-designed; all the elements necessary for this are present.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will bring in a good one.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a more level water.
Here's a cut from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with high officials on his first day on duty, he brought out a key issue in President Donald Trump's White House, which he planned to resolve by getting bad information into the President's hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to move through her, either on paper or at meetings, as the president would make better decisions if he were given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have also tried to do so and they have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits haven't gone away.
"If candidate Trump was upset about the dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also reflected in the affected publications honestly," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits, according to six former campaigners, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a song of praise in a stable way".
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter usage habits have ever "been under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's tweets would have been even more incendiary without their interference.
We'll probably never know about tweets Trump didn't post.
If his assistants managed to get him out of trouble just a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from consistently creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House of competing clicks, people try exclusively to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, reporting on the whole story, wrote in May about the tendency of the councillors to feed the president information of strategically questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say Trump may react to negative press, especially leaks of information with damaging effects, explosively, obsessing about their source.
This was also the case at the end of February when someone gloatly gave the president a printed copy of an article on the website GotNews.com of Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "source of multiple information leaks".
It doesn't matter that Johnson is permanently blocked from Twitter because of taunting, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he's made false accusations in the past and retracted them.
Trump read the article and began asking subordinates about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and head of the White House office, Rob Porter "has attempted to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trump".
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
Maybe he turns out to be a more effective leader from Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad to the capital do not hesitate to obtain permission to perform.
Many foreigners go to music in the centre of Tallinn.
Those whom the Evening Gazette spoke with admitted to playing in the Old Town without permission from the city hall.
First we found three street musicians near the Viru Gates who had brought the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with Rastapats and broken clothes were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with an amusing rhythm on the accordion, while a man next to him juggled with three balls and invited passersby closer.
The third man had sat next to them on a backpack and smoked his own fucked-up joint in peace of heart.
Their three dogs did not let themselves be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Played by Noem and juggled by balls, Bob said he was playing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the company's performance was to raise ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day.
On the question of whether they asked the city for permission to play in the old town, Noem and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and mostly permits are given for a month or something like that.
There's no point in paying for it", Bob explained.
When we got back to the Viru Gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians' house and driving them away.
The company moved their backpacks and dogs to the junction of Viru Keskus to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one playing violin, the other clarinet and the third carrying an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living", explained trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be permission from the city hall to perform.
"Of course we don't have it", he said jokingly.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but we have to try", he added.
Eesti Pank bought 149 million euros of bonds in July as part of the euro area central banksâ€™ public asset purchase programme, and the central bankâ€™s bond portfolio increased to 4.36 billion euros.
The central bank will not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The Governor of Eesti Pank, Hardo Hansson, has explained in response to earlier inquiries by members of the Riigikogu that the Eurosystem central banksâ€™ asset purchase programme covers three different purchasing programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector, ABS and PSPP.
The central bank buys bonds on the market to encourage investors who have sold them to invest money elsewhere.
The purchases have the effect of reducing the return on lower-risk assets, and this motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, each central bank buys its own government bonds under a public bond purchase programme, while no other government bonds are purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase programme is limited.
Eesti Pank, according to Hansson, usually buys bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank has been purchasing bonds under the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Eleringâ€™s bonds were also purchased, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Eleringâ€™s bonds from June 2016.
Since June, both Elering and Eesti Energia will buy bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Travelers ignore ditches and return to "millionaire district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again fallen into fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the ditch dug by the council to win back the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field into a wealthy "millionaire district" near Solihull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after being kicked out of there only in May, without being disturbed by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot on the defensive, squeezing their vehicles through an unobstructed section that had been left as a footpath.
The furious residents have cursed Solihull Council, saying that the council is "unnecessary in dealing with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there Monday night after their eviction from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The Council must be ashamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were chased away, and now they're back again.
More of them came in last night, probably even more today."
He added, "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long seals to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to have to keep paying council tax if the council can't even stop such a thing."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: "This is ridiculous. We have just seen the last of these travelers leave, and a new attack is already taking place.
This time the number has increased and the grass has even seen the horse chew."
A spokesman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campground on the land near Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with the Solihull police. We are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
It will help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The Weekend festival is visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that the real top names of the world have been brought to Estonia.
The question of why the Weekend festival is so important to Estonians is answered by Saar that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival three days in full.
However, he admits that real players have arrived in PÃ¤rnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, then that the absolute top names of this musical genre will be brought home - this is not often happening around us", says the Minister of Culture.
But at what festivals do artists speak the most about the island itself?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists is definitely Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
After all, according to his record twist, at some point all of us have been spinning our feet", he says.
However, he brings up several more names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers: starting with the NO!P and they can be read in a series.
In reality this concentration of known names is very high", he says.
Take a closer look at the video of the Evening Newspaper!
Audi renews car manufacturers struck amid criticism of up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the BMW chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers have enthusiastically advertised the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide released from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise the emissions of diesel vehicles will increase for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs pointing to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, who silenced the use of so-called fraud devices, which allowed the exhaust emissions to be adjusted to conform to regulations while testing the car, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics division of the Audi Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audit of installing the system to circumvent European exhaust emission requirements, thus extending the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen's luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
20 000 euros worth of European Union flags will be purchased for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy the flags of the European Union for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union flag will receive 570 educational institutions.
Flags are designed for indoor display, they must also be carried out in high quality printing equipment indoors with tunnel fastening, mediated by the news portal of the ERR.
The label of the flagguard reads: "A gift for Estonian schools to mark Estonia's first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the 570 flags is estimated at 20 000 euros, i.e. one flag costs 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat situation in Mexico
Workers of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, sown by organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss which one seems safer: either bring the children to the office with them, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the front of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "aliens".
They ask reporters to provide names to each column without needing evidence, enough with impressions and gutting.
There are suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists to be employed by governments or cartels, a whole list of criminals who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the greater the number of bodies that accumulate across the country since President Enrique Pena Nieto's inauguration in December 2012, at least 25.589 journalists have been under national protection since the attacks and threats, and at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states this year.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a profound feeling, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of Valdez showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice", and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, are wearing T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his distinctive Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death, reporters discussing joint trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which amount to thousands, journalists' killers rarely come to justice.
The Riodoce editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the killers' records and justice, the security meeting is of little use, according to Ibarra.
"It's very silly to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"Until the cause is known, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped him from the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to get out of the car and was shot 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name, which means "Twelfth River".
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a wife and two adult children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez is mainly subject to silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields since rival clicks struggle to fill the power vacuum.
It does not matter that a few or even several people are shot daily on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is full of twice the mausoleums of drug kings that are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to how the seaside state is governed by only one cartel with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers involved in his work, Riodoce, co-founder and manager of Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels enormous remorse that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, who competed with Guzman's sons and was at war with a click of the cartel.
This piece of writing may have angered sons by suspected gang members buying all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid on another newspaper editorial covering the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodace by selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "was unable to deal with the press without touching the drug problem".
In time, the newspaper gained notoriety with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a print from which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American excerpts.
In the same year, the Valdez Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said while accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he said in an interview given to TV channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the task that the journalistic profession carries with it another way is to play the fool.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodace collective misses Valdez, a joker who swears as a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar across the street and was always sitting at the same table.
Now they're asking if his love of routine got him killed.
His death has also caused them to doubt themselves how best to do their work and survive.
"They don't like it when you mess with these women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is strong self - censorship and self - maintenance.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Riodace editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be fooled...and that's how this happened to Javier".
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, or other states that are home to the toxic combination of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly mobile phones were no longer allowed; a few days before this it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two police officers sought relief in the shade of a tree from a 40-degree heat.
They were assigned by the government to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-story building in the Culiacan middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters wondered if these policemen were among the 50 percent policemen whom the governor himself has labeled as unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous rural areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
This weekâ€™s edition of Riodoce dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had an revealing story of spending government funds on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement as to who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew about the restaurant was a favorite place for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant is registered under the name of a politician belonging to the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
More recently, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread coverage of corruption as part of lawsuits.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents in the same location, including how the son of Guzman wearing the nickname El Chapo escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have looked for Valdez's column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"Formerly we would have known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose klenic bodybuilding has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels with our sources have been disrupted."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of labels and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration over another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez.
The body has been found burned, and according to officials, it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal, and scold the phrase "SOS press" as an organized protest to sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, manager Bojorquez is away in Washington, D.C., trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death while meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Afterwards, he asked to be diverted from the government's coverage of activities, worried that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists were "limited" by organized crime, complicit state officials, and indifferent society.
In his last book "Narcojournalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by orders from politicians and security forces who are in league with organized crime.
The media monitoring group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and state officials.
"In Mexico you will die because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously bloodthirsty.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found along with a letter presumably signed by the cartel Los Zetas, "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his severed head lay a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others go on to do as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after their manager was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with the editorial "What do you want from us?" on the front cover.
Some journalists have fled home states or even the country.
It's a nervous decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still have to look at the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they are chased, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico three months after leaving Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wished to become a poet, admits that echoing the drug trade frightens him.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office on the sidewalk and sipping beer when suddenly everyone's phones began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had died in a confirmed firefight between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the area.
From the edge of the sidewalk, reporters put the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The front cover of the next day needed to be changed.
Sirens hollered along another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez peered at the police officers on duty to see if they were alert.
If they were scared, at least they didn't show it.
Under the massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, on which his middle finger is seen throughout Sinaloa, the Riodace staff edited in his footsteps.
"How could one possibly think of closing at all," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets for a report?"
Dinosaur used protection to prevent enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though rather frightening.
Scientists have now made public the first findings regarding the incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by the Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It is so well-preserved that it was even possible to establish that its armoured skin was reddish-brown in colour and its past had been somewhat "complex".
A reportage published in Current Biology magazine described the creature as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
Fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation ragged researchers who describe it as "really remarkable".
This armored vegetarian is, according to the National Geographic magazine, the best preserved type of fossil ever found.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He struck something that did not resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to explore more closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The next six years were being worked to excavate the animal from 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be brought to the public.
"If you squint a little, you can almost believe he's asleep," said Caleb Brown, lead author, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researching his skin, researchers found that this herbivore, although covered in scales and resembling a walking tank, was likely significantly threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This heavily armored dinosaur used red and white protection to hide from predators and applied a cloaking technique called counter-shadow, which is also used by many animals today.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to better blend in and avoid enemies, as the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110-million-year-old nodosaurs family creature first made the news in May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealopelta Markmitchell Museum, a member of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the body of the animal.
They discovered a counter-sacrifice - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, meaning that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower.
Although the counter-shadow has spread, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals living today with counter-shadows.
This suggests that the dinosaur was hunted actively enough by other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to hide instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
However, most of the animals using today's counter-shadows - e.g. deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to make a real effort to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a dinosaur, enormously large and armored, shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous age may have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal in order to get clues about its life, including the content of its remaining gut, to find out what the animal would have eaten for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, thus reaching the sea with a current, where it sank its back in front of the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in South Florida, and rivers and oceans probably extended much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable as it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, but it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as it did in the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use too much imagination to reconstruct it - it's enough just to squint your eyes and it feels like she's sleeping."
The Cretaceous era was a time when vast flesh - eating dinosaurs â€” theropods â€” roamed the earth on two legs.
Although the rex of all of them king Tyrannosaurus lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its fearsome predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 ft (11.5 m) tall and six ton-weight monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings are published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta washed into the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined at a Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and scales, and it is a comprehensive cone to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 ft (five m) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch long spikes broke out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored herbivore ventured through present-day western Canada until the flooded river washed into its open sea.
However, the dinosaur's underwater burial site helped to preserve its scales in excellent detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that lumpy armor plates along the dinosaur skulls still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine, "This degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
The petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates on the skull of the animal.
The right foreleg lies next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
How did an activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident was sitting through Airbnb in a rented room on the bed, browsing on the phone on Facebook.
He ended up in a post he used to be a schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his stream, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The posts of @TheePharoah user with Pideme had repeatedly been further distributed on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area broadcast real-time tweets about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He hung up his phone, but saw tweets again later in the evening, reporting a gathering of people on Canfield Drive this time.
Photographs of police tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father were shared and kept a sign saying "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!".
He watched a real-time stream where a police officer was standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In the second video, another police officer, according to him, cocked a rifle and yelled, "I will kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we could call typical."
I felt the creeps at that moment.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 23, he went to his father's house to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive the next morning alone to Ferguson.
What took place with Ferrelli and Ferguson for the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary Whose Streets? ("Whose Streets?"), which premieres in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the perspective of those people who live in this community and who filled the streets with answers demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter, wearing a flowery dress and a crown matching it on their head, drove towards Ferguson, they again talked about what they had been talking about many times before this morning - the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right".
"I couldn't not take him with me," Ferrell later said.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know it and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we must do to get free and free.
Even if I succeed in raising her so that she does not personally experience brazen racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on South Florissant Road - a place across the street from the police station, which had become a kind of campground where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was eventually not charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who was preparing lunch meals.
They put together grocery bags and helped distribute them to protesters.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activism began to take shape slowly.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," he said, noting that while he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Minority Nursing Students Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I didn't have any organizing experience.
It all just worked out."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, co-director of a film during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
A question arose to Ferrell's mind: "Are you trying to document what is happening or to find a story that can be exploited?"
Such skepticism was the result of countless cases in which people - often white people - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already struck a deal with fellow director Damon Davis, a district artist known for activism in relation to death row inmates.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the film's "Whose Streets?" team after Brown was shot for years.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that's how they portray me."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not about "the leader of the ransomer, but about the assembly of the community", as Folayan said - he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished linen.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story emphasizes and refocuses the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who came up with the theme reference #BlackLivesMatter in 2012 following the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin on social media, are homosexual.
"In a leading role, black homosexual women have maintained the movement in general," said Ferrell, "and this is precisely because we have to fight on several fronts constantly.
Black homosexual women must carry all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women".
He argues, however, that "there is no action with some kind of equal opportunity-building thing" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the focal point of the film because of his identity.
"He was the person from whom the right energy was exploded," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that she was right on the front line, because there's a lot at stake living as a black homosexual woman at such nodes.
His energy can be sensed through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and police are still fragile.
The parole sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the highway will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the sociopolitical atmosphere in the region, which he calls home, simply a "danger".
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has etched in memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
7 tricks to get over the hangover after the Weekend party
Some of the toughest boys will find it helpful after a drunken party.
Or according to the saying "don't hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a healthy banter.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow's Weekend dance or other party and get over the hangover as painlessly as possible?
Drink some water.
Down to and after the big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since your body loses a lot of fluid by drinking alcohol, you have to get it back somehow.
Along with water, minerals are washed out of the body, and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure you shouldn't hang over to your grandmother's to break wood -- it could be a fatal misdemeanor.
But a light walk will help your body remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Lying in a tent and sleeping out a hangover is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give the body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're getting sick enough from overdrinking last night, it's definitely not worth trying to load a big fat fry into your stomach.
Start with fresh juice, for example, that contains fruity sugars that slowly lift your body.
If your health is suffering around noon, you might want to try some broth.
And a little later in the back.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the last water.
Like I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you are taking an painkiller to prevent hangovers in the evening, your liver will have to deal with not only alcohol but also paracetamol or ibuprofen, thus losing performance.
That way you'll ruin your liver even more, and from now on, the hangovers will be worse.
Plus, the painkiller doesn't stay in the body very long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach - it'll upset your already torn stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, get along with yourself.
It's about the same as walking, but you can't have an orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid excessive tempo and frantic postures - during hangovers, physical exertion should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Talk nonsense to friends and fellow sufferers, make simple fools and laugh friendlyly at yourself and others (suffering).
Jokes and laughter may not make you hang over, but they're definitely more fun to take after-effects with.
One day the hangover will pass anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University staff are wanted as suspects of murder
According to police, there is a nationwide search for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who have become suspects after finding the body of a man with fatal stabbing wounds in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to Cook County court records, warrants were issued on Monday for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbings.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
Policemen received a phone call and found a victim arriving at the Grand Plaza apartment building with multiple stab wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators treat stabbing as murder while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in a statement sent as an e-mail that Lathem is now temporarily suspended from work and is banned from entering campuses at Northwestern University.
"The act is now with the criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and the University of Northwestern is cooperating with investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a Senior Assistant in Finance at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in a statement forwarded as an e-mail: "We have been in contact with the British police and prepared to assist the U.S. investigating authorities in every possible way."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and would like him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago Police Department's Communications Department, urges suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are working more and more intensively to determine the exact location," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the manager of the apartment building at Grand Plaza, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment number 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was a gruesome spectacle.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July as well.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," added Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the residents, "Police are currently working on chronology of events and determining the background of the victim, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family dispute."
Start-up companies that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the polls were unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who manages Madison Reed, an e-commerce company operating in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for help from outsiders.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with the stated aim of measuring employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line of complaints, and in some cases allow speakers to bypass C-level managers and turn directly to the board.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City's start-up company Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Errett, in the three years he has used Glint, he has received a much better view of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to surveys and surveys aimed at specific teams, it offers a company heat chart that provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to identify the reasons.
Companies have come to understand that they need to stay up to date with their work culture in order not to become the next Uber to be wrapped up in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance may be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a start-up company operating in Denver, Colorado, which helps businesses prevent and identify inappropriate behavior, observed an increase in interest and activity this year in the background of Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convert lets companies send custom impulse polls, collect confidential answers in real time, and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line allowing employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been usurped by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employee awareness of regulations and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find a telephone number or email address at the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday general counsel James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to monitor employees' complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, however, there are possible problems, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which did not reach past drivers operating in offices in other cities or states, to identify and deal with them more quickly.
"I can get closer to the workers' Holistic 360-degree experience," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, or after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
However, it was not until "social media became mature", the companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly washed online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convert offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supporting both start-ups.
Convercent was funded by 10 million dollars in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thereby raising the value of the capital raised to $47 million.
Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, given the interlinkages between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are mere stakes on the table.
Workers want to feel accepted and valued and devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, they feel they are being listened to and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of the Department of General Benefit and Employee Experience in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and involvement, it is no wonder they are receiving support.
Owning data on employee involvement is important, according to professional culture experts.
However, this data is useless if the company's supervisors do nothing with it.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that changes will come.
And if change does not happen quickly enough or not at all, it can lead to disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of the consulting and business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things don't finish, the employees will think, 'Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from frustrated employees about the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams within the company and offer communication training to deal with the problems.
However, in Ruby Tuesday, new data on employees is collected and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high turnover of labour.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses."
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltic States: income is growing fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic States, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes in reference to the European Central Bank report.
According to the data of the Central Bank, since 1999, the total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Progress is due to low indebtedness, rapidly improving institutions and business- and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic countries, along with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita from purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average", the central bank stated.
Although the aim is to ensure that the total economic output per capita is equal to the wealthier Western Europe, in 2015 the total output per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local population is not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the Latvian and Lithuanian population estimated that their economies were doing very well, or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed thought this about the economies of their countries.
NCAA decision to cancel twice-a-day workouts makes Bruins days long
It is almost 23 a.m. when a tropic group of UCLA footballers stop at the edge of a new practice field on the team's campus for conversation.
Some of them have stripped off their shirts, exposing their sweaty backs to the efforts of the first day of training camp.
For much of the team, these idle minutes offer a midday break.
Players attending summer courses head back to the dormitory for final exams after three hours of practice before returning to Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel training sessions twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until they finish their final exams on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three training sessions were scheduled to begin at 7.15 p.m. to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two workouts a day means more days with one workout - the beginning of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week forward compared to the previous season and for the first time during the six seasons of Mora Westwood, training takes place during summer courses.
They have 18 practice sessions scheduled until August 20, before official preparation for the opening game against Texas A&M in September begins.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another item to the players' tight schedules.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they will break through this ordeal; they will exert themselves, they will be fine young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be really nice."
When the camp is finished, UCLA makes the trainings closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of their squares from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Centre, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have bypassed the protective network around the gatepost.
Since that weekend, the hotel is occupied by Bruins players, but Mora admitted that problems with vacant rooms may arise during the season.
"We are implementing security measures," said Mora.
"This is a real place of concern and it is not at all exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have a recording of your training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're gonna use a security team over there in parking lot eight.
We'll do our best using what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about that.
We have a plan in place."
The Savisaare-Ivanova Electoral Union, born in retaliation to the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland, expelled from the Reform Party and Maria Kaljuste, formed by joining forces forced to leave the EKRE, and Tegus Tallinn, a businessmen's Electoral Union that hopes to show the peoples of the Party a seat, seems to participate in local elections at least as much as the political parties.
Chicks, however, will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough frustrated voters for all of them.
Who's staying with Savi Island?
When Edgar Savisaarâ€™s support team has shrunk, the events organised in honour of his electoral alliance can be anticipated.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current central parties and many unknown faces - is that what the composition of the electoral alliance will be like?
And can you look for a reason why some loyal adherents and friends of Savisaare are shunning their candidacy in Tallinn, because the "Savisaar List" of absentees, led by corrupts and suspected of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
The music video filmed on the roof of the city hall for a Russian-language pop song featuring the parent of LasnamÃ¤e district; and in every sense a primitive computer game in which Prime Minister JÃ¼ri Ratas, driving on his bike, must avoid puddles and squirrels on the road â€“ is this the way the Centre Party is seeking the votes of the 16- and 17-year-old voters who are admitted to the ballot boxes for the first time?
We look forward to seeing what other political parties are thinking of a youth-like election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers are looking at a black square instead of an entertainment show from the beginning of August, there are two choices: to accept that from now on, only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 channels will be available or to assign a ten-pointer each month to a television operator.
There are probably also those who, at first, publicly rejoice over the unadvertised television experience, but in the end, however, - albeit reluctantly - pay for the television picture and the adverts.
The deafening music, the noisy crowd, and the trash left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you donâ€™t want to be a part of it yourself, itâ€™s better to go home and discover your country instead of having a headache and leave the place to the festival guests for a lot of money.
Washington changes green card rules
Media publications quote President Donald Trump, who says a new U.S. immigration plan is planned, which changes the rules of the green card.
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on the acquisition of temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money as it changes the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and begin to replace the current program.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said according to media outlets in the United States.
Siberian Seto youths move to the city, retirees return to the countryside.
Yevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of famous Seto gold miners along the former Maana River.
He works as a driver in a goldartel near the tributary of the Maana River Kuvai, 140 kilometres from home.
It is a tough job: two months in a row without days off for 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
During his three years at Artelli, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
'There is a hard order: if you go in, you will be thoroughly checked to ensure that you don't bring vodka, and if you go out, so that you don't take gold,' says Anatoly.
Mare Piho chatting with the local Seto Jaan in Haida village, who has told him a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of Siberian Setos is beginning to influence the home-setos as well, because it is just so staggering, thinks Piho Mare, who studied the remote Setos most thoroughly.
It's 30 years since his first exploration trip to Siberia this year.
During that time, he has visited there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many Setus did they still emigrate to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
It's an unresolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I calculated it from the stories of the Siberian Seto men who have thought about it.
It is difficult to say exactly because at that time up to 30 people could come in one group, but only the man was given a passport.
The passport was only given to one, but with him were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was many times larger than historical Setomaa.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas not only connected with agriculture but also with the river (palge rafting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petseri, many of the Setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (you were built by the Soviet power of the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos then make up the majority of the population in this area?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of intermarriage and much childhood was long preserved.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much did Siberian Seto culture differ and differ from native Seto?
They are different, though what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They made their own clothes, but they always knew the difference between what had been brought and what had been done here.
The traditional Seto clothing was heavily influenced by climate change, as it is colder here.
There's been a change in food intake.
For example, in Setomaa, the meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.
Where are the Siberian Seto villages and what kind of life do they live there? / Graphics: Alari Paluots
The bond with the motherland was spiritually strong; it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back to it, start affecting them.
Those girls who've lived here in families have been listening to amazing stories.
Piho is referring to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to visit Haida at the beginning of July to Seto Kingdom Day and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
"It is very easy to come and go to kill, because the city has an excellent location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of the highways", says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural sites, and pizza is available on every corner.
Kill is a top-top town!
There is a small island along the White River running through the city where the killers tend to have a Midsummer Feast.
"This beautiful place doesn't come out of the train window", Reigo smiles.
Whoever is not afraid of cold water can swim in this river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming in there. It'll be fine.
You can have a picnic on the river and just make a romance - you can watch the river flow and think about life ahead and behind.
I've been walking there with my girlfriends, too.
The Operaisolist Dam has been practicing its arias on the riverbank between the three bridges: "Because this place is on the outskirts of the city, no one may come back if I hum my stories".
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa from MÃ¤nnikumÃ¤e, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and now play discgolf - a golf course is made, disks can be rented from the fitness centre", Reigo leads.
The old pros go there with their disks, of course, but I haven't been there to play yet.
You probably have to invite your colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa because he's an experienced disc golf player and he's got the disks.
I think he'll lend it to me!
Reigo and MÃ¤nnikumÃ¤gi were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during ski classes.
There are many tears, disappointments left on this mountain, and victories in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The entire downtown is currently full of construction works, all this is changing to the unknown", Reigo praises.
Kill the old and tired station building, however, is a very attractive place where summer discoveries are played.
I am glad that in 2012 the head of R.A.A.A.M. MÃ¤rt Meos accepted my idea and came to the station with his theatre to do a summer theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with "Aleksei Karenin" was just over, on August 11 the railway station will have "Resurrection", when the old station is moving around in the 1980s.
"From August 11-13 it is Tapa City Days, during which after the opening of the home cafÃ©s of the station building and several cultural events are held, including the People's Rally", Reigo says, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city in those days.
A little yellow cabin on May 1st Avenue has been in the museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are very many exhibits and information enormously", Reigo praises a place full of Tapa city history, most of which focuses on railroad and warfare.
Reigo smiles that if you go through all the recommended places in Tapa, your stomach will go hungry after a while, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such great dining places and when you sit in cafes sometimes you get the feeling that you are abroad", he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafÃ©s, which is why sitting there makes it strange that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international community together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we've got a lot moving!
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
TV channel bTV quoted the State Department as reporting that two Bulgarians were taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
Police arrested a group of illegally camping people on the Sithonia Peninsula on the morning of 1 August, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation going on.
The State Department told the television channel bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place that is not intended to do so.
Controls continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Puppy-taught wolves go and break sheep.
After a year's break, the farmers of Hiiumaa have to give the wolves "learning material" from their herd again - probably the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three, 124 a year earlier.
There is also data from the environmental agency that last year no wolf litter was born in Hiiumaa and information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that two wolf litters have been fixed on the island this year.
During the night against Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste municipality and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of Rheselja village and severely injured another, who had to be killed.
Rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent to the coordination circle a draft law amending the GMOVS Act and the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the Act waives the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and operators, for which the Plant Health Register will be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation for GM crop handlers to have a prior agreement within the prescribed radius with the beekeeping operator is amended.
Although no GM crops are currently being grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.
This is at least until it is decided to declare Estonia GMO-free", said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors", added Suu.
The draft Act repeals provisions related to the GM crop inventory and handling training in GM crop locations and handlers, establishes requirements for GM crop handling and start-up business activities.
With regard to specific beekeeping, the existing obligation of the GM crop grower to inform the beekeepers of the start of the GM crop is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of the cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult it in the draft information system and to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs if they wish.
The proposed changes will affect in particular persons active in the plant production sector, beekeepers and the Agricultural Office.
Only one GM crop - maize MON 810 - is allowed to be grown in the European Union, including Estonia.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
The reason for this is that there is no maize pest, a European stalk beetle, to which the maize line MON 810 is resistant, in Estonia.
Varieties of this corn line have also been bred for southern areas, and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to obtain the above assurance, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in seeds of various varieties of summer rape, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The analytical results of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any extraneous genes and the study concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above, it can be concluded that there is no conscious cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia and it was also confirmed that no accidental contamination has occurred.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United recruited "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited a "genius" in Nemanja Matic's face after a midfielder against Sampdoria made his debut on Wednesday night.
A player bought over from Chelsea for Â£40 million started in Dublin in United's final pre-season match ahead of Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid in a 2â€“1 win starting line-up on Tuesday, impressing in the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on offensive tackles.
However, having missed the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul missed out on the match form and only lasted 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, this must be fixed firmly before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football disposition," Mourinho said.
"Let's help him achieve form at the earliest opportunity."
Like Matic, other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting line-up at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho started quietly to set up his eleven starting men by the start of the season.
The Independent disclosed this week that Mourinho still wishes to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club had already done a "excellent job", signing contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another stork boy got a GSM transmitter on his leg on August 1 and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird-watcher living in SÃµrve, the first stork became SÃµrves, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nesting grounds and joined the large pool of overnight stays in MÃµlutu-Surgelah.
Because there are no fields in SÃµrve, the Voice of the Isles writes.
This Tuesday, relatively late for cranes to be ringed, another stork and so on Muhu Island became attached to the transmitter.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter on SÃµrves TÃ¼rju.
"His activities are all watched on the Internet: he went to Spain to winter, topped the German-Polish border for a while and then came to Saaremaa", Martinson said.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and the car with a handsign.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could open his front door with a mere hand signal, get into the office, and even start a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and forefinger and now provides this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant-anesthesiologist at the Royal Hospital in Hampshire County, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company will also replace the locks on houses and cars to match the chip, asking for Â£300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has installed the technology now both at home and in his car in BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House Expo Cost Taxpayers Thousands
According to the military documents disclosed to TIME magazine, the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter into the southern courtyard last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000 for an American production event.
The green and white-colored Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the President's time on board, was the central attraction of an event introducing American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials, on their tour, were news of industrial products from all 50 states.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the squadron responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House War Cabinet required the helicopter to be present with a section order, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern courtyard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said the day before the event in an e-mail to his superior, the deputy naval commanding officer in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the southern courtyard at around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the event beginning at 3 p.m. and would remain there until the yard was cleared between 6 p.m. and 21 p.m. on the same evening.
Added was the fact that if leaving the White House were to be delayed, a second ekipage is required for return flight due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter at the time of the event, and the squadron security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its ground stay.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to TIME magazine whether or not a second copy was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
Documents indicate that HMX-1 was investigating whether a given event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it was in violation of Hatch's law, and we were told not to," the commander wrote.
"It seems you have no choice," answered the deputy commanding officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even formal events have political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of the health care reform discussed at the event in the Senate at the time, and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them for a purely photographic session is unusual.
Trump came to attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, rolled into the background with the President's plane, and his Twitter account is teeming with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the President's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display 'made in America' featuring products from all 50 states made of American materials by American workers," said White House spokesman Acting Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often take test flights around Washington and the southern courtyard to practice putting down the President of the United States at the White House with a centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 tryouts in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to the "America-made" event was considered as the norm for flight instruction flights that month.
Squadron helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits of the event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky's spokesperson, the company was not involved in organizing the display on the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain the president's flight budget records and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly prices for fiscal year 2017, the compensation rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron's documents noted the length of the flight as its main base from Naval Quantico Airfield in Virginia in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated reimbursement rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other sunk costs to be taken into account for the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defenceâ€™s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it."
It is not clear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter during a tour of the southern courtyard as part of the event, but he did get behind the wheel of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, throwing jokes at media outlets about the company's products in his personal aircraft fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 MMil Daegu, Shadeiko was hit in the final area, with a 800 m run at the foot ramp, and the pitcher was taken away from the stadium with a stretcher.
Just before that, he had received a zero in the long jump at the Universiade held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was spoiled by an injury in Cheapiske, but at the debut Olympics held in London, he gained 23rd place with 6013 points.
However, the misfortune continued.
After the opening day of the 2013 Moscow MM, the Estonian woman who was on the chart for the Estonian record suffered a foot injury in the distance jump.
Two years later, he took 15th place at the Beijing MM and fulfilled the Olympic norm, but this too had wanted more disappointment for the athlete.
Shadeiko only passed through the heaviest gauntlet last year, when she did not get the result in the Amsterdam EM at first.
I'd just like to put together a decent multi-race one time.
Once", confessed Shadeiko.
Worse was still ahead: a month later, his Olympic match in Rio was interrupted due to a thigh injury as early as the first hurdle.
Time had to slow down - is there any way to go with the seven race?
Is two days of effort worth all this?
She thought long, but found peace.
I was able to clean my head.
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience, but I have thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and clean your head.
"I knew I wouldn't bag the pill yet", Shadeiko tells of her self-purge.
I was able to turn the slate clean and move on with a new momentum.
According to coach Anne MÃ¤gi, it was very difficult to watch the suffering of the subject, but she realized that the athlete must first and foremost find out for himself.
He was so maimed by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit, however, said he would not give up and he wants to prove to himself what he is worth", Hill says.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He's doing it for his own good.
The competition came back in May, when Å adeiko set up a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the GÃ¶tzis multi-course competition.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark in a bullet push with nearly a metre (13.89) and ran in a record-close time hurdle run.
At that time, the multiple contestant felt that it was not a ceiling of abilities, but that all that was extinguished was a primary hunger of competition.
Hill, who supervised him for years, says that Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good at training.
If something's wrong or wrong, he'll say it now.
He knows his own body and trusts his own sense.
That's what we need to build on.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the kind of person who does the maximum in practice", he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
The happiness of a loved oneâ€™s baby makes him happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by the happiness of loved ones.
Both her former training partner Maris MÃ¤gi and sister Grete recently became parents, and several contestants have received support from new weather citizens.
"It's been interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to brain "training".
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" process of tasting wine.
By sniffing the glass, spinning the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brain to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the way the brain "sees" the colors.
"Taste is not in wine, taste creates wine taster", says Sheperd.
For example, things that still affect the development of the taste of wine include our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that wine is not to get drunk.
"There must be more in action", he says.
If you take too much of a sip, the system will be oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk losing their memory, losing their balance and losing their mental capacity.
10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay from colleagues
Data from the HR search company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay from colleagues.
The ten-percent pay gap is between men and women, writes portal Genius.
The pay survey of the ICT sector in Fontes involved 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
A total of 8,577 posts were under consideration.
63% of the posts were held by men.
"While only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and in the opinion of the rest of the companies there is no pay gap, in reality the basic monthly wage of men is on average 10% higher than that of women and the total annual wage of men is on average 8% higher than that of women", said Fontes' analyst Ilmar PÃµhjala.
Season 3 commercial clip of "Narcos": Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali cartel will take central place in the Netflix hit series
Despite being revealed to be Pablo Escobar's killer in the second season of "Narcos", the Netflix series is far from finished.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first of them has already produced a commercial clip, which teases the new villains of the series.
In season three, the DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug trading organization - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, "like the Fortune 500 company", with just more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) runs connections with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York City.
In a freshly released promotional clip, Pedro sees Pascal return as Javier Penana, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement to assist in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
"Narcos' third season gets the opening shot on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the nation if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN relief mission, said that hundreds of women are running for office in local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of recently registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only truly represent the people and be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
For its part, the Taliban has threatened the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's election marks the first time that power is peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes each thing more awesome for both the large and the small.
There's always too little time together, but training with the kids gives you a good chance to combine being together, playing around, getting close, and getting busy.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you cruise in the summer, you always have live Hantians with you, and with your thin little voice you eagerly remember, "Let's work out now too!"
Start with the warm-up - very good is a normal game of hawks or running along the beach strip.
A squat is the foundation of feet and buttocks - who would want to take the shape of a sandbread washed from the waves during the summer?
It's wonderful to use children instead of levers!
First, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually growing at the same rate as the strength of the trainer.
Advanced ones can also make hoops with pretty big kids.
A child trains balance, reads repetitions, and enjoys the opportunity to hang high and be important.
Bigger kids can make their own hoops at the same time.
Set the range of movement by touching the earth and stretching out your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-mart to hold it tight.
A child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a very useful exercise, but it's hopelessly boring for a child.
But it's easy to make it more fun!
Game Plank: Take a long plank column to take turns.
It's harder than usual, but it's much more fun to do than to give a friend a hand in the meantime.
To add to the load, the plang, the tiny on the back, may remain, and in this position also walk around.
An extra weight may be placed on the hips of a smaller child, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While crabs simmer on the sand, triceps, buttocks, and abdominal muscles are burdened like naksti.
The child descends on his feet in such a way that his or her body weight is evenly distributed in front and back.
You can hold hands for safety.
Tilt your legs and stretch straight up.
Kid can fly, have fun, train balance and be a weight.
A little coach's life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
The extra load is given by stretching the legs forward.
Make sure your back stays in a neutral position.
Children themselves have much more fun doing abs in pairs and claps.
Hand job and pulse.
Watch the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All the children's favorite and great fun!
For parents while truly effective in whole body exercise.

From the Philippines to the Wide World, or Beerbag's Journey to the Heart of Fashion Fans
Bags braided with straw are a summer classic, which has become a hit product in recent years, which one right summer-joyer has to hang on his hand and which merchants, despite its modest origin, have been able to weld with a price tag appropriate to the hit.
A bag braided with straw is probably one of those things that have existed every time in their lives and have not caused much emotion to possess.
It just exists, and if not, nothing is broken.
Now, however, the straw bags are about to make a real race, and fashion fans have switched their fine designer bags for summer months for simple straw braided bags.
Not only is it a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and bolder women even walk into the office with it.
At this point, however, it is worth making clear first whether such a summer look still sits for the boss or whether it is worth pushing the weed and laptop into a slightly more formal sumadan.
The wealth of variety has made straw bags a true love of summer for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to notice is that fashion gourmets rush to the local market first on their holiday trip and buy themselves a straw bag that will be trusted for the rest of the holiday and which comes with the beach, the market and friends hanging out on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy bags on the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world women (and men!) would probably go hand-to-hand with each other to become the happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, this madness is understandable, because it is rare to buy a hit-and-run thing for just a few dozen euros in fashion.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way to make money here, so finer luxury brands sell straw bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably just so the richer customers don't have to feel like mere mortals propping around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana a straw bag worth over a thousand euros.
However, the interpretation of Chanel's straw bag could be worth 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion hits, however, the straw bags do not come from a large fashion mecca, but from far away.
In fact, straw bags are said to come from far away Philippines, from which they have passed into the wide world.
Weaving a bag of straws is primarily an expo business there, and the locals do not often see them going around.
It is said that straw weaving techniques date back to the 14th century and are quite sarane with the usual basket weaving.
However, since the straw bag does not have to be so heavily braided as the basket, patterns and other materials can be woven into it, which makes the bag more distinctive and more attractive.
For example, recent trendy bags with coloured ribbons or leather bands braided in.
The thanks note can primarily be sent to the actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided fan of the straw bag never seen before.
Namely, he matched the straw bag with all sorts of outfits and did not consider it much even to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of the bags today does not make it any less important, however, that their care is a cock head and, unlike all other Sumadans, they do not need to be cared for by special means, but water and a wet towel do the same.
As is the case with trends, brands besides classic appearances have come up with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, a straw braid or a small shoulder bag may be purchased if you want.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic straw bag never goes out of fashion, but a shoulder bag does.
So, what's the classic straw bag like?
For centuries it has been considered a classic straw braided bag that resembles a basket in its style, is open from the top, and has short handles, as well as straw.

GMB worries about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union expects the leaders of cookie manufacturer McVitie's to confirm long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent on the future of the Tollcross object investment.
More than 500 people are employed at the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
The company's McVitie's owner, Pladis, said they had invested more than Â£5 million in the object over the past few years.
More workers were hired there, and union leaders "are the first to hear" if anything changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter to the company's object manager, GMB addressed Scotland's company McVitie's request to "remove concerns about not using funding to modernize production lines".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said, "The fact that we can't get clarity from the object's general manager on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan is a matter of deep concern to our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around Glasgow, as an essential pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and well-being in the East of Glasgow, and against the background of Brexit, an increase in living costs, and a chronic decline in production, badly needs a thriving company in McVitie."
A spokesman for Pladis said, "Tollcross's object manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company responds directly to him as we value active interaction with workers and union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between Tollcross staff and GMB representatives, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and precarious economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our activities - and that applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure that we are competitive.
He added, "In recent years, we have invested over Â£5 million in the Tollcross object, most of which has gone into production lines and operations improvements.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as an object of production, and should there be any change in the activity of the object, the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in an effort to lure Neymar into his ranks by making an offer of Â£189 million to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record-breaking invasion?
This bumpy approach has opened a summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record of overselling, which was set last season with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for Â£89 million.
Once the changeover is complete, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive over Â£500,000 per week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry both by the approach and by breaking Neymar free, although a source close to the Catalans board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival at Santos in 2013.
But did the president of the PSG warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser alerted Al-Khelaif harshly to all clubs thinking about recruiting some of the PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will confront them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign a deal with any of our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest, losing one of their precious assets in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit threatens to seriously strike a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland", Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it", he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not boundaries", he emphasized.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain a part of the European Union, and because it is not able to do so, to remain a part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said, "Surely we could have one with Britain".
An alternative to this would be a return to the customs posts, which would declare historical rift and political failure.
"The barrier to trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "a challenge to our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Irish daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland while visiting Belfast.
Through his first half-long triathlon, MÃ¤rt Avandi: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital OtepÃ¤Ã¤, when about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries entered the semi-long Ironman competition.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling, and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, MÃ¤rt Avandi, who also finished the first triathlon of his life, triumphantly.
"I thought it would be complicated and it was complicated in the end", Avandi said at the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that the triathlon was in fact accessible to almost everyone.
"Not distance kills, but pace kills", he said, hinting that at an affordable pace, almost everyone reaches the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Oti's physique is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim".
Avandi had been working out eagerly since February.
First four or five hours a week, later ten hours a week.
With a time of 05:34:12, he achieved 270th place in the overall count.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and JÃ¼rgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he defeated other so-called "prominent class" contestants.
Tanel Padar, who was the person of the "good example" last year, lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The German Johannes Moldan was crowned the overall winner of the men's reckoning of the OtepÃ¤Ã¤ stage in the Ironman series with a time of 3:58:27; the best of the Estonians was Ivo Suur with a time of 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Dane Helle Frederiksen triumphed at 04:24:01, and of the Estonians Maria Rabbit, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour and was made by 04:58:58.
The opening passed a 1.9 km long swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
Out of the water he came in 410th position.
