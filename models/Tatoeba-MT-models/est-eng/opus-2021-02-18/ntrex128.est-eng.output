Members of the Wales National Assembly fear that they look like Muppets.
Some members of the National Assembly are appalled by the recommendation to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The subject has begun with the plan to change the name of the National Assembly into a parliament in Wales.
The representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
One member of the Labour Assembly said that his groupmates were concerned because it rhymed with the words “Twp and Pwp”.
To explain to readers outside Wales: the word daft in Welsh means napaka and pwp means poop.
A member of the platform said that the whole group “is not happy” and has proposed other names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group had a “receptive” view of the change of name, but noted that the word “MWP” was very similar to the word “Muppet”.
To explain: in Welsh, the pronunciation of the letter w is similar to the pronunciation of Yorkshire English u.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a draft law on the name change, said: “The final decision on all the names by which members of the National Assembly are invited will, of course, be made by the Members themselves.”
The Act of the Welsh Government of 2017 gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals for names, which broadly supports the idea of renouncing the National Assembly as a parliament in Wales.
As regards the title of members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the designation "Wales MEPs" or WMPs, but the participants in the public consultation were most in favour of the option "MWP".
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge for President-in-Office Elin Jones, who should present a draft law on amendments in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act also includes other changes to the principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly shall remain with the Members themselves in the legislative debate.
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters vote to rename their country as the Northern Macedonian Republic.
A referendum will be held with the aim of resolving a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour represents a requirement for this territory and has repeatedly raised objections to the application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the change of name, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue that the change in name is only the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent because the Harlem churches are struggling.
"The older people I've talked to have said that there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one else."
He said that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People communicate differently today," he said.
“Bars are no longer living rooms in the neighborhood where people stay every day.”
As far as the churches are concerned, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as the leaders hope, and “earlier or later they will be back at the beginning”.
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who do not give the rest of the neighborhood a hand to the holy houses.
“The vast majority who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who therefore speed up the arrival of this day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that most of the people who live here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin’s Church ten years later.
The original congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregation, who had worshiped God so far in the vicinity, took over the property of the building.
St. Martin's church was occupied by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against shopkeepers on 125th Street in Harlem when they refused to hire or promote black people.
In the fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they introduced a carilion, or clock game.
Father Johnson's son and successor to St Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson proudly called the carilion "the bells of poor people".
The expert who played the carillion in July gave it a different name: “cultural value” and “an unreplaceable historical tool”.
The expert from Tiffany Ng Michigan University also noted that this was the first carillion in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a larger carill 18 years ago at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
What has been played in St. Martin’s Church in recent months has been the story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been accompanied by secular leaders of the church, others by the bishopric.
In July, the congregation’s governing body, consisting of secular leaders, complained in writing to the diocese that the diocese was “trying to pass on the costs”, although the presidency was not even involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members complained about the poor transparency of the diocese's actions.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old boy dived for lobsters.
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived into California for lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. in Encinitas near Beacon's Beach.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour, when he heard the boy screams for help and then swam over to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for receiving the lobster, but “I realized then that the boy screamed, “I was bitten!
I was bitten!".
His whole clavicle was ripped bare," Hammel described the sight he saw when he arrived at the boy.
“I called on everyone to come out of the water, “There is a shark in the water,” Hammel added.
A boy in a life threatening state was taken by plane to Rady's children's hospital in San Diego.
The attack shark species is unknown so far.
The lifeguard and Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that the sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was established that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were at the top of the hull.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes from Casablad to Swamin.
Giles added that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to take over the UK beauty product market
Sainsbury's takes over the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, creating supermarket-like aisles for beauty products, including expert advisors.
As part of a significant penetration into the UK’s GBP 2.7 billion beauty market, which continues to rise as the sale of fashion and household goods decreases, the wider range of beauty products will be tested in 11 shops all over the country, using them in other shops next year, if successful.
It is invested in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to exploit the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's said that it plans to double its range of beauty products to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also given more space in brand areas such as are currently found in Boots stores.
The supermarket also brings back to the market its own series of make-up products, Boutique, in which most products are suitable for vegans, because young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, is experimenting with a single sale at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opens this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and switching to daily shopping for small quantities of food from local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to try harder to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO, Mike Coupe, has said that sales outlets are becoming more and more like supermarkets because the supermarket chain is trying to combat low-cost chains such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and so has Habitats outlets, since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported the sale of groceries and made acquisitions more profitable.
The earlier attempt by the supermarket to upgrade its beauty and treatment departments ended with failure.
Sainsbury experimented with Boots in the early 2000 ’ s, but it ended with a contention as to how to share the proceeds of the sale of pharmacy products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold 281 sons to the pharmaceutical business three years ago for £125 million in Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trading chain.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxurious skin care products, including from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the product range of his four stores.
Sainsbury’s business manager, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of the aisles of our beauty products in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained workers who are always prepared to advise.
Our choice of brands meets every need. However, the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive beauty trading destination that can change the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up the £11 million deal.
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, left with a "rare rage" when TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby lacks time for the home goods and clothing brand Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The 37-year-old director of the TV show "This Morning" announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star swayed by Peter Jones, stepping out of their luxurious lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV star girl admitted the intense meeting that took place on Tuesday at Marlows Buckinghamshire, the headquarters of the man's business empire, that his new contracts worth £1.5 million meant that she no longer had enough time to commit to the Truly brand of home clothes and clothing.
The business has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly was certainly Holly’s main preference.
It was supposed to secure his long - term future, so she thought she was working on it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything involved in the matter in complete amazement.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to placing the product line on the market.
There's a warehouse at Marlow headquarters full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that leaving one of Britain's most paid celebrities can cost the company millions, because a large amount of money has been invested in products that range from sofa cushions and candles to clothing and home clothes.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the trademark as chairman in March.
Couples go on vacations together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's teleproduction company.
Willoughby will be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin with I'm A Celebrity.
One of Jones’s close sources said last night, “I don’t want to comment on his business. ”
Hard talk, "after what we fell in love"
Trump joked about criticisms in the news for a comment that some consider to be "unworthy to the President" and excessive positivity towards the head of state of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his mocking "newsman's voice,"
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear-weapon waiver.
However, negotiations for the withdrawal of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see the US’s “corresponding response” to North Korea’s initial disarmament steps.
On the contrary, he noted that the US would continue to impose pressurising restrictions on the country in the future.
Trump's pep talk was much more lively.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“The war with North Korea was about to begin.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we're very well together."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced good results: rocket attempts have been completed, hostages have been helped to be released, and the repatriation of the remains of American servants has been arranged.
He also defended his unusual communication with Kim.
“Being president is very easy, but instead of allowing 10,000 people to wait outside to get into this stuffed stadium, it is better if we have almost 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of us.
Tsunami and the earthquake are destroying the island of Indonesia, killing hundreds of people.
In eliminating the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared as a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international aid, so things are a little complicated," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organisation is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Palu in order to decide whether the international authorities would be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has surprisingly little prepared to deal with natural forces.
Although shelters from tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are not common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given about the tsunami, the apparent absence of the tsunami warning siren increased the number of fatalities in Palu.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is also quite challenging in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics there even more difficult.
The hospital ship that stopped in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it takes at least three days to arrive at the new scene.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of the split infrastructure of Indonesia a central part of his electoral campaign and has distributed money to roads and railways.
However, the budget deficits threaten Mr Joko's government, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr Joko is also being pressurised by the tensions in Indonesia among the generous, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to a more old-fashioned form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes because of the fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets, using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look, Liverpool Daniel Sturridge beats the drawgate against Chelsea in the game.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing it in Chelsea's Premier League, tied up at the 89th game in Stamford Bridge, London on Saturday.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate, when his team led 1:0.
He hit the ball to his left before he hit it in the direction of a further pole.
The ball flew high over the penalty zone and hit the top right corner of the net.
It fell over with Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get the position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are going to pass on the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win as much time as I could for myself,” said Sturridge on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I took one touch, and I hit him without thinking."
At the end of the first half, Chelsea 1:0 led the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th game minute.
Blues' attacker threw the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in this game before he turned around in the center square and swooped towards Liverpool.
Kovacic took a quick pass in the middle of the field.
Then he created a beautiful air raid, leading Hazard into the penal area.
Hazard got through the defense and hit the net with his left foot, past Alisson Becker, the player in Liverpool.
Liverpool will play with Naples in the League of Champions subgroup on Wednesday at 15.00 in Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is facing Videoton in the UEFA Euro League game on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of people killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, said the State Disaster Board on Sunday morning.
A number of people were trapped in the wreckage of the buildings that collapsed due to the 7.5-magnite earthquake that took place on Friday and led to the 18-metre tsunamis, said the spokesperson of the office at the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho press conference.
With more than 380 000 inhabitants, the city was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police are arresting a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after his wife was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was started after finding her body this morning at Merseyside in Birkenhead.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with puncture wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man has been arrested for murder.
The police are calling for people in the area who may have seen or heard something.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is only at the beginning, but I would ask everyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street to hear or see anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask all taxi drivers, especially those whose cameras may have recorded something, to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that a woman found in a building was a resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, alleged friends of a woman came to the scene asking questions about where she was found this morning.
There's an investigation going on, and the police say they're informing close relatives of the woman.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was impressed when he heard of the incident.
The residents were told that it might take hours to get back into the house.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman at the scene in tears.
He kept saying, "It's terrible."
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still in a closed area and the third was immediately near it.
A number of police officers were standing in the area watching the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about the event is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 using the keyword September 30 log 247.
The statue of Parliament Cromwell is the last monument that is the cause of the “rewriting of history” quarrel
Eliminating it would be a poetic justice for destroying so many of England's cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style that the man's inhumane pious followers did.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as foolishness and an attempt to rewrite history.
Cromwell Society chairman John Goldsmith said: “In the current discussion on the removal of statues, it was impossible for Oliver Cromwell to remain intact in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not pillage pictures in the English Civil War himself, nor did he order others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell man's ancestor Thomas was sacrificed for the actions of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the history description of the person to whom many people believe he should still pay tribute."
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people considered Cromwell’s parliamentary defender at the end of 19 rather than today for external pressure and, of course, for kingship.
Whether this is an accurate representation is an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer beat a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, in southwestern China, a farmer attacked a pig that killed a man on the market.
A man who was only identified as Yuan was found dead with an injured artery and blood covered by a pigulu near the Liepenshui market in Guizhou province, reported South China’s Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, the pig keeper prepared in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, to vaccinate pigs in his barn.
Supposedly, on Wednesday he and his cousin had come from a nearby province in Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the pig feather next door was open.
He said there was a large thorn with a bloody mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the 249.47 kilos of barley had killed the farmer according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were all bloody and crushed,” the newspaper Guiyang Evening News broadcasts the words of the victim’s cousin Wu.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entered the market Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found nearly an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else until the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are allegedly discussing compensation for the death of a man.
Although rare, pigs have been reported to attack humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 2,98,83 pounds [294,83 kg] nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, when a farmer in Oregon ate his own pigs, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs would not normally attack, but because of the taste of blood, their heads could go dark.
“They’re just playful.
They're very curious marakrats whose purpose is not to harm them.
You just have to respect them enough," said the man.
The afterwinds of Hurricane Rosa bring large rainfall to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken, moving across the northern coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
Nevertheless, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rainstorms to North Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday morning at 5 p.m., the east coast time classed Rosa as a first category hurricane with winds of 136,78 kilometers per hour, located 619,59 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific begins to develop a low - pressure area heading east toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it starts directing deep tropical moisture towards the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to two and a half inches [25.4 cm].
Then, in the southwestern part of the country, the reaction of the approaching low - pressure tropical humidity produces extensive heavy rainfalls in the coming days.
At times, rains falling from two and a half inches [2.54 to 10.16 cm] cause dangerous flashes, floodwater, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in precipitation of five to about seven and a half centimetres per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations ranging from 5,08 to 10,16 centimetres are also expected in certain southwestern regions of the United States, particularly Arizona.
Sudden events are possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Surely, in the event of the risk of tropical rainfall, you should not walk in the desert.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to turn into fast-flowing rivers and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by gusts of wind and volatile dust.
At times, the approaching low pressure will lead to severe rainfall along the coasts of Southern California.
It is possible to have a total rainfall of more than 1.27 centimetres and may cause smaller floodwaters and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, and rains become extensive on Monday evening and Tuesday.
The heavy rains reach Four Corner on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations are predicted in the US due to the cooling of the Arctic, while temperatures remain high in tropical areas.
Sometimes this leads to major temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday weather is an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missour) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range from nearly 20 degrees.
In the next few days, long summer warmth will try to recapture itself.
A large part of the central and eastern parts of the United States is expected to be warm in October with temperatures ranging from 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] to the north-east of the country.
New York City is expected to have 26.6 degrees of heat on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that there is a likelihood of high average temperatures in the East of the United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was reviewed by over 20 million people
On Thursday, over 20 million people looked through six television channels at the confessions of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, who allegedly accused her of sexual violence in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political impasse continued, where the broadcasters interrupted the display of traditional broadcasts to reflect the last minute turns on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drew up a contract for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Legal Affairs Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed him drunk and tried to rip his wife's clothes off at the high school prom.
Kavanaugh, in her passionate confession, said that she was absolutely certain that it didn't happen.
Apparently, according to Nielsen’s report, more than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also usually having problems calculating the number of people who watch transfers in the authorities.
By way of comparison, it is about as big an audience as it is at football finals or Oscars.
Fox News Channel's opinion leaders, who have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks in an average session of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day, said Nielsen.
With the 3.26 million viewers, ABC was in second place.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the centerpiece of Friday's drama.
After a statement by a moderate Republican office stating that he is voting for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught a man on Friday morning, when he had been subjected to an abuse by protesters in an attempt to take the elevator to a meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
He was standing there for minutes when he was accused and transferred directly to CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are completely powerless.”
Flake said that his department issued a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he had more to say in the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The cable and broadcasting networks reflected live broadcasts several hours later, when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote in order to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate plenary for vote.
But Flake says he's only doing it in the understanding that the FBI will investigate the prosecutions against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the outnumbered Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by a conversation with a friend of the Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and the other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an impact because it was obvious that the Republicans would not meet Kavanaugh's votes without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of political play
In an interview given to Sunday Times, the Prime Minister accused those who judge his plans to leave the European Union, the “political game” with the future of Britain and the damage to national interest.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May and former Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the front page, Johnson pressed his attack towards May's so-called Brexit checkers plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "totally mindless".
Gunshot of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting a 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and sentenced to murder in the second degree, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the opposition between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, informed CBS-owned TV channel WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer reported a man's bail is set at $350,000 (EUR 308 600.30).
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday that a gunshot wound to the head caused a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Task Force on Refugees, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, the Southern University police and the people living in the area for their assistance in the investigation, which led to the arrest of the suspect.
Joe Alleva, the sports director of LSU, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “care and justice. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
A man of 1,98 meters grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
The average of his last season's games was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the whole team was "smacked" and "shocked" because of Wayde's death.
“It’s something you’re always worried about,” said Wade.
The volcano is exploding over Mexico City.
Ashes erupting from a volcano called Popocatepetl have reached the southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans on Saturday, ordering them to stay away from the volcano, as the crater again began activities that resulted in 183 incidents of gas emissions and ash exploding within 24 hours.
The center monitored a number of rumblings and tremors.
The pictures distributed in social media represented the windshields of an ash-covered car in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the capital after the 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police encounters with the Catalonian separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona following the clash of pro-independence protesters with the riot police. Thousands joined the anti-opinion demonstrations to celebrate Catalonia's opposing vote on the withdrawal.
A group of disguising combatants who were held back by riot police attacked the last with eggs and powder paint, creating thick dust clouds on the streets, usually full of tourists.
The struggles occurred later when the police had to use clubs to control the fights.
For several hours, those who sang “No forgetfulness, no forgiveness”, who voted in favour of independence, ran into protesters who were in favour of the unity of the country, who shouted “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, 14 people who suffered minor injuries at the demonstration received medical attention.
Tensions continue to prevail in the region supporting independence a year later when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but which was still celebrated by the Catalans in favour of secession.
The voters voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence, although the turnout was low, because those who objected to resignation largely ignored the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year when the police tried to block the vote in front of the voting stations throughout the region, leading to violent clashes.
The supporters of independence had spent the night on Friday in front of the voting stations to avoid demonstrations supporting the national police.
However, the demonstrations took place, but they had to take a different route.
The 68-year-old, Narcis Termes, who worked as an electrician, participated in a demonstration in favour of separation with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope of seeing Catalonia independent.
“Last year, one of the best moments of our lives took place.
I saw my parents crying with joy over the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite an important but small victory in the regional elections last December, it has been difficult for political parties supporting Catalan independence to maintain their will this year, as a number of well-known leaders have either gone into exile themselves or have been detained and are waiting for a trial on their part in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who records demonstrations in support of the police on her cell phone, said that the politicians on both sides were instigating the fight.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in the investigating prison since last year, announced that he will be taking part in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The election to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the retreat of democratic values and the pressure exerted by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because the car was hit by a house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after the house was repeatedly rammed in Londonderry by car.
The case took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
Also, a bow arrow may have been fired at some point in the direction of the car.
Menga's kick gives Livingston 1-0 in front of the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory.
The promoted Livingston grabbed the Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games when he was the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's blow proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernia in a second.
Gerrard will not win in the first league this season, and next Sunday he will face the leading Hearts who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euro League.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded its invincible attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of defeat since Kenny Miler was replaced last month.
Livingston loses opportunity against dull visitors
Holt's team should have been in charge long before the goal was set, since their direct play style caused the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts went out at the gate where Alan Lithgow made an effort to hit Craig Halket's main strike over the gate.
The hosts calmly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests in certain places.
And that's also the way in which the defining gate was struck.
Rangers gave up the free kick and Livingston had an opportunity to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and managed to do so from the center of the penalty zone.
By that time, the Rangers possessed the ball, but could not penetrate the defense, so the goalie, Liam Kelly, was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the gate once.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor pushed Scott Pittman's shot and Lithgow shone brightly in Livingston's next team effort.
The strikes were constantly in the Livingston Penalty and were systematically kicked out of it, as well as two perpetrations, one for the attempt to replace Glenn Middleton from Halkett and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Phenomenal Achievement from Livingston – Analysis
BBC in Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaron Stadium in Scotland
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was excellent, completely exceeding expectations when moving up the ladder.
Their style of playing and their players have hardly changed since their return to excellence, but Holt must be honored for how he has hardened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, organising a perfectly organized defense while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worralli on his hind legs throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked encouragement.
Regardless of their intermediate level of good leadership under Gerrard, this was not enough, according to the examples here.
Their last mastery of the ball proved to be inadequate: the homewards only occurred once, which could act as an alarm bell for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan’s controversial reception in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), Berlin had both smiles and a cloud of anxiety when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been sidelined on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom are deaf, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to host the Turkish President in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude towards the guest is divided: some Turks in Germany welcome him as a hero, while others despise the man as a self-reigner.
Road accident on Deptford Road: cyclist killed in a car collision
In London, a cyclist crashed into a car.
The collision took place on a fast-moving road near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of town at about 10:15 British summertime.
The driver stopped and the ambulance doctors arrived to provide help, but the man died at the scene.
A few months later, another cyclist was killed in a collision nearly two kilometres from the Saturday crash site on Childers Street, where a driver hit a rider fled the scene.
The London police said that the authorities are working on identifying the man and informing his loved ones.
Traffic is closed at the scene and buses are diverted, motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officials were injured in riots
The prison authorities reported that six prison officials were injured in riots in a very secure men’s prison.
The unrest broke out in His Majesty Long Lartin's prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. British summertime and is not yet over.
In order to deal with one wing of unrest involving eight prisoners, expert riot police officers are involved.
Prison officials were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison workers have been invited to solve an ongoing case in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, they will be handed over to the police, and their prison sentence may be extended."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June he was informed that the prison leader was taken to hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, riot police were called to prison to calm serious riots, in which prison officials were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden fires (the Hurricane can be useful for drought areas)
Tropical low pressure does not often hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the crumbling hurricane Rosa moves across the southwestern desert of the United States, resulting in the threat of sudden fires.
The National Weather Service has already arranged surveillance of sudden fires on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, in the south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is predicted that Rosa will head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area on Monday with rains.
Phoenix’s national weather service indicated that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low pressure level within a radius of 321,86 kilometres from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64,37 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5.08 and 10.16 centimetres of rain, which can reach up to 15.24 centimetres in the limited areas of Arizona Mogollon Rimi.
In other desert areas of the southeast of the United States, including the central part of the Rockies and the Great Hive, precipitation is likely from 2.54 to 5.08 centimetres, reaching up to 10.16 centimetres in limited areas.
Rosa’s precipitation may be a blessing to the areas that endure sudden arrivals, as the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rainfall is likely to be beneficial as drought prevails in south-west America.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, the second largest category of drought, reported byweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa Baja crosses the California Peninsula on the mainland of Mexico.
Rosa, which was still on Sunday morning with the biggest winds at hurricane level at 6.43 kilometres per hour, is now 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 kilometers per hour northwards.
The storm comes into contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean, and this causes a slight subsidence.
So Rosa is expected to land Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
Precipitation in certain areas of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
‘Baja from California to the northwest part of Sonora can be expected to rain, with a total of between 7.62 and 15.24 centimetres, reaching in some places up to 25.4 centimetres,’ saidweather.com.
Rosa then heads across Mexico as a tropical storm northwards, reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure zone that moves across Arizona and reaches southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“The main threat following Rosa or its sequelae is very heavy rains in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern United States desert," said the National Hurricane Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life - threatening flashes and floodwaters in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton's attack: four attempted murder arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder with suspicion after a 16-year-old boy with puncture wounds was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 4:00 British Summer Time.
The victim was taken to hospital in a “stable” state.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, said the police.
Officials are asking anyone who may have cell phone records on the case.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered" under the Democratic Party's "sin and hate"
“The support of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in his cheer speech in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “suffered” during his appointment process under the democratic party’s “sisterness and anger”.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, violently rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that she was attacked by a man several decades ago when they were teenagers.
He also gave a statement at the hearing about his accusations for Ford.
On Saturday, the president said that "America saw Kavanaugh's glory, quality and courage that day."
The vote given for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most esteemed lawyers of our time who has an impeccable background in public service," he told the support of the West Virginia crowd.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Mr Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republic's turnout in the mid-term elections.
“Five weeks left until one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but actually I'm running," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission that aims to “continu and prevent”.
The first main procedural vote on the Senate floor on the candidate for office in Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, the senior assistant of the Republican party leaders told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, casualties are rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed up when the tsunamis invaded the beach after a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday to the beach festival in Palu City, when during the age, six - foot - long waves hit the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that was left on the road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still doing their thing on the beach, not fleeing immediately, thus remaining victims,” said a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a press conference in Jakarta.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with him, wiping everything off the ground,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved at a speed of 800 km per hour on the high seas before reaching shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 centre.
Air pictures published by the Catastrophe Board showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and water - surrounded mosques.
The waves in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
There was a wave of earthquakes in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released after a major earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city near the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets, and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found beneath the wreckage of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and damage could be higher in a coastal area 300 km north of Palus, called Donggala, closer to the center of the earthquake.
Reports from Dongga “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information”, said Nugroho.
“The region has more than 300 000 inhabitants,” said the Red Cross in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“It is already a tragedy that can get worse,” he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in the town of Palu, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach at the same time as the warning was issued.
On the social media, amateur frames can see a man on the top floor of a building who panics to warn people on the street below about the approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to confirm the accuracy of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that prevented communication in the Palu area and made it difficult for authorities to carry out rescue work.
The military has started sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities to help, said the authorities, but the evacuation workers are still in dire need of food and other basic supplies.
The city-based airport was reopened for rescue, otherwise closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia rose to over 800.
This is really bad.
Although the World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Ask, where they were hidden in the tarmacs set up in the courtyard of their office, they saw devastating sights on their way, said Mr. Dosheba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
This is really bad.
Although the reinforcements began to forcefully mitigate the disaster, some complained that the employees of highly experienced foreign relief organisations were prevented from travelling to Palusa.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and support may only be sent from abroad if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It continues to be a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“If the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we can begin to accept international aid, but such a state has not yet been declared.”
When the second night arrived, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends of the missing people and families were still full of hope that their loved ones would be miraculous cases that would ease the gloom of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer well.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was trapped next to her mother's body for two days under the rubble.
Coach Gendon Subandono of the Indonesian national slide parachute team trained two missing slide parachuters for Asian games that took place in Indonesia early this month.
The rest who are trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel are his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
“As a senior slide parachute, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon was talking about how, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he was desperately sending messages from WhatsHelp to the competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
"I think that means that the messages did not arrive," he said.
Thieves took 23 585,88 euros while filling the ATM in Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, the thieves stole EUR 23 585,88 from a Brink employee who runs the Levees ATM, and the Newport Police Department published a press release.
The driver emptied an ATM at an entertainment facility and prepared to get more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
When the man acted, “the other man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag for delivery that was full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, wrote a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about thieves is asked to contact the Newport police on the phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper takes his new name Ye
Rappy Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced a change on Twitter, he wrote: “Former Kanye West.
A 41-year-old West has been called Ye for some time and the man used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change takes place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where the man is expected to publish his new album in Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grandet, who canceled his concert “with emotion,” said the author of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the man’s current speaker name, West has said in advance that it is a religious word for him.
“I think that “ye” is one of the most widely used words in the Bible, meaning “you” there,” West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with Big Boy.
“Therefore I am you, I am us, that is us.
I changed my name from Kanye, which means "this one", to Ye, which is only a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanye West is not the only rapper who plays with his name.
Sean Combs is known mainly under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with West, has also used its name with a dash and without it, in capital letters and lower case letters.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use military forces against civilians.
At a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use an army against civilians.
On Sunday at Tlatelco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised that “no army will ever be used to contain Mexicans.”
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration on the field on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were in charge throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying monthly grants to students and opening up more public universities free of charge.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence.
"As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this area," said the financier and artificial intelligence professional Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after various parts of the US Government made statements concerning artificial intelligence, although the US has no overall official strategy for artificial intelligence.
At the same time, last year China introduced its plan to be a player in the renewal of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Double research budgets for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US and we are working towards the next artificial intelligence breakthrough," Lee said.
Double funding would double the probability that the next major achievement of artificial intelligence would be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book A.I. Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which financed one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked with an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the best player in America, Othello. Later, he was on the board of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the technology competitions of the previous US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency competition, and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“U.S. scientists have to work hard to get government funding,” Lee said.
“China is not the one taking over the intellectuals, it is the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think that those who have received a PhD in artificial intelligence should be offered a green card automatically,” said the man.
The State Council of China published the next generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation shares funding for people working in academic institutions, just like the way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a unified artificial intelligence centre aimed at involving partners from both industry and educational institutions.
This month, DARPA announced that it had started to fund the AI Next initiative with two million dollars.
But the state research fund currently finances over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been amended.
Macedonians vote on the change of state name in referendums
The Macedonians voted on Sunday's referendum on whether to change the country's name into the Northern Macedonian Republic. This would be a step that would also resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from confirming its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour’s name is a requirement for this territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries agreed in June on Macedonia's new name, but ethnic opponents claim that the name would undermine the national identity of the Slavic people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not intend to take part in the referendum and that the campaign of irregularities had raised doubts as to whether turnout would reach the 50% participation rate required for the referendum.
The referendum asks: "Are you in favour of Macedonia joining NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price paid by Macedonia, which is one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure its accession to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and the young people of Macedonia so that they could live freely under the protective arm of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority of Parliament's votes.
The National Electoral Commission said that there were no reports of irregularities at 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, Macedonia’s capital.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and their son, Dushko, voted in a referendum on 30 September 2018 on the change of name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kaardarkov set up a small stage, bringing chairs to tents for those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to be a member of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the servants’ door," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and get from European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investments into Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority supports changing the name, as over 80 percent of citizens are in favour of belonging to the EU and NATO," said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said "yes" would be "confirmation of our future."
The results of the survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research on Monday revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters, which is below the necessary turnout, are planning to participate in the referendum.
The survey conducted by Macedonia Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said that they would say yes.
The rate of success of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the government's Western policy after the government took over last May.
Look, Manchester City player Sergio Aguero is going through Brighton's entire defense for the gate.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling invaded Brighton's defenses, ensuring that Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like his 65th-minute-playing gate came in ridiculously easy.
Argentina's attacker went through the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He broke through three Brighton protectors before he got to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defense before running past several players on the border of Brighton's penal area.
Then he hit the ball to his left, where Sterling was.
The English assailant used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to beat Brighton's goalie Mathew Ryan with a punch on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues a preliminary head start in the Premier League fight.
The gate was hit at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton's territory.
He sent the ball nicely to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane got hit a few times before he led Sterling further away.
Sky Blues kicked the ball into the net just before it slipped out of bounds.
Manchester City will play with Hoffenheim at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the breaker against Rockies.
When the Nationals were excluded from the final tournament, there was no reason for a fresh start.
However, the combative Scherzer hopes to destroy Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockies, who runs Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still has a chance of getting to the finals.
On Friday night, Rockies guaranteed at least five or two of the winnings of the Nationals, but the team still wants to secure the status of their first division.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, we can at least try knowing that playing in Denver with the audience and the other team is probably higher than any other game that I can expect this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete here?"
The Nationals haven't named an opening player since Sunday, but they're supposed to be leaning towards Scherzer's pass in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feeding, made a warm-up session and bait on Thursday as usual on Sunday.
This Washington right-handed player leads 18-7, his ERA is 2,53, the number of kickouts is 300 and the number of favorable options is 220 2/3 this season.
Trump's giving a pep talk in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the Republic's turnout in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
This is a major event in which I am not running, but I am actually running. Therefore, I am present everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely terrible extremist group of democrats, and you see this happening before your own eyes.
And they've decided to take back power by any means you can see their mean and dirty game.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over for power and control. All they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give it to them."
Democrats, he claims, are on a mission with the aim of "receive and prevent".
“And you have seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the democrats “hateful, wicked, lowly, and deceitful.”
He referred by name to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat member of the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, who was shouted out loud in the audience.
"Remember his answer?
Did you leak that document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, um, no, wait – this was one of the worst examples of body language, actually the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a great association.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinions
When the activists of my local party, Momentum, voted to condemn me, that was not surprising.
After all, I am the last on the Labour Members' list to be told that you are not welcome, all for expressing your opinion.
My fellow Member in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because she stood strongly for the anti-Jewish identity.
In my case, the judges judged me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar issues, on which Jeremy was also divided with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party communication stated that “we would like meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
To a large extent, the experience of my eight-year local Labour MEP with the meetings of the General Assembly on Friday evenings is exactly the same.
As of today, this unfortunately no longer applies to most meetings, and the promise to be “kinder and more generous” in politics has long been forgotten if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the different points of view are not acceptable in the Labour Party and, for every opinion, it is assessed who is acceptable to the Party's management.
It started just after Jeremy became the leader. The co-worker, with whom I thought of sharing similar political views earlier, was now waiting for me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would never otherwise have agreed to, regardless of whether these were national security or EU single market issues.
Every time I stand up in public somewhere, no matter what I actually say, it is followed by condemnation in social media, encouraging my withdrawal, ignoring party politics and saying that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow workers, because my comments are mostly political.
I admire the competence and judgment of fellow workers who face sexist or racist abuse every day but never give up.
One of the most disappointing views of this policy area is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer such a large association, and with any "untrust" initiative or amendment of the electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years to keep my head down, to speak less, and "then it would be all right."
But that's not what I came here to do in politics.
Since I joined the Leiborist Party as a school student 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher Government, which had left my large school classroom on the brink of literally collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who need it most, acting as both a member of the local council and a minister of government.
I've never hidden my policy, including in the last election.
There is no way anyone in Nottingham East could have gotten confused about my political positions or the areas of disagreement with my local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of recall or political consideration will stop me from working for what I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have tilted the outcome somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the first league game of this wonderfully fun Tennt.
They're now the only team out of 10 at the top of the chart.
Finally, it was a high level of protection for the team and better risk-taking that led to the home team's victory, and Coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
“We have been tested all the time during the games and we are still invincible, so of course I am happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “I respect Ayr, they used their opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute trial, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a head start, but the yellow card given to the Scottish captain, Rory Hughes, who gave up the Warriors, gave Melros a chance where Jason Baggot made a failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayri’s head start with a penalty kick just before the end of the half-life, reaching a position in favour of Ayr from 17 to 5 by the end of the half.
But Melrose started the second half successfully, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which was taken over by Baggot, narrowed the gap by five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken away on the stretcher. As the game continued, Ayr’s head start increased further thanks to the Stafford McDowall experiment, which was transmitted by Climo.
Ayr's acting Captain Blair MacPherson was on a yellow card at the time, but once again Melrose's player Bruce Colvine paid for the failed transmission after heavy pressure.
However, the team playing in the home square regained strength, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson put the ball behind the advancing Ayrs.
Climo passed on the ball, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe tried David Armstrong's caste and sent side protection Gregor Henry away on the fifth attempt of the team playing on the home field.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the field of hospitality services after it was discovered that the man was appointed director of a recognized restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a well-known BBC TV series he writes and plays with a long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the ninth season ahead will be the last of the series and Kiernan seems to be making new plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wished to enter the “blossom restaurant business” of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without sea borders hopes that the court will open their way back to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The blue flags of the ocean fly above the buildings of the administration.
For naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is our right.
It is our duty to restore it."
A memory of a coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still alive in Bolivia without a sea border, and a desire to sail again in the Pacific is also alive.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and the country is naturally waiting for a yes," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A number of Bolivians across the country are looking at the decision of the international court on the big screens, in the hope that the Hague Court will decide in favor of Bolivia, after decades of intermittent discussions, Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia in order to give it its own way to the sea.
The charismatic native president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who will face the controversial battle of re-election next year, will be much at stake by Monday's decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to vote in favor of Bolivia, or if so, it would change very little.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands has no authority to give away Chilean territory and it has provided that it does not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court is made only six months after hearing the final statements indicates that this was not a "complicated case", said Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate.
And as Bolivia draws away from its additional causes, the past four years may have worsened the situation.
"The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by the current Bolivian authorities," said Zárate.
Morales’ belligerent eloquence has lost all of Chile’s goodwill, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after all this, the debate will be extremely difficult.
Two countries haven't changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court was unnecessarily quick.
Monday gives Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in the country’s relations with Chile” and “to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the best-known presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue to express political resentment.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific,” he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea said that nuclear weapons will not be released until the country can't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first unless they could trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Meeting on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made by the competitors’ leaders during the Singapore Summit.
He will comment on the matter when US Secretary of State Mike Pompoo almost seems to be reopening a deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, these are air castles, according to which the US continues to be restricted and its refusal to end the war with Korea will cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards disarming.
Kim and President Donald Trump both want a second summit.
However, scepticism is common, according to which Pyongyang intends to seriously abandon the arms that the state is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
The Bomb Party plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on another summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show brings a series of massive hats to the viewer, brought to the buyers in their neighborhood shopping streets
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you will no longer have to look.
During their 2019 summer season, designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought on stage a series of strange super-sighty hats that blinded the Paris Fashion Week.
High and impractical hats are in fashion this summer via Instagram, and these designers have sent their stunning creations to fashion outlets.
Valentino’s top piece was a beige hat that covered models’ heads, decorated with a wide border that resembles feathers.
Other very large items of clothing included watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple, adorned with jewels, but their purpose is not to heat their heads.
Thom Browne also showed a strange choice of masks, doing so just in time for Halloween.
Much of the colored masks were sewn together with their mouths, so they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than the high way.
One part of the work resembled a diving suit with an air tube and glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cream puff.
And if you keep going on with the giant moe-kids, you'll be lucky.
Moegurud predicts that oversized headgear can reach shopping streets near you.
The super-large hats are coming right after La Bomba, a 60-inch straw hat seen in the head of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created a largely impractical hat, was thrown into social media by sending another great work — a beach bag of straw, almost as big as a bikini model carrying it.
The dark orange raffia bag, with raffist fringes and white leather sang, was a top piece of the summer collection of Jacquemus La Riviera in Paris Fashion Week 2019.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags on shopping streets next summer. As the designer has had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra-large items of clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important for world citizens
The Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the academic ranking and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exams, strengthened by personal and joint success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where over 30 000 students are studying across Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), try to provide the best service for their pupils and their parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it comes to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's latest exam results show that the tops of the tables are languages where the level of passing exams is highest among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high result of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students were grade A in Mandarin, 72 percent of German students received the same grade, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential life skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages that are now among the choice of subjects are in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of private schools and other schools.
A study carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find a job vacancy, 17% of respondents had a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future work.
As more job opportunities are expected to require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice made, acquiring a second language will give a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are life-long.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens immediately gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey conducted in 2013 by more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 per cent of respondents speak no foreign language well enough to have a conversation about it. The only language with a two-digit percentage was French with 15 per cent.
It is therefore important to finance language learning for children today.
Knowing the languages of several languages, especially those of emerging economies, gives children better opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
A number of schools focus on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, private schools always have the possibility to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
The Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
It can no longer be denied that languages are crucial for the future of a country in a globalised business environment, which is why it must also be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Private schools continue to offer young Scots choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron's doing his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
Zealous fans don't have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James was playing Sunday's pre-season opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his number of play minutes still needs to be determined.
“It’s more than one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was probably playing a count of minutes.
After last week's training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I do not need preseason games at this stage of my career to warm myself up," he said.
Trump West Virginia Election Campaign Event, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will start his campaign show tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first campaign event scheduled for next week out of five, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time as the confirmation vote is held until Trump elects who will be appointed to the free seat of the Supreme Court, he tries to increase support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened by the loss of control in Congress after the vote in November.
What time is Trump's campaign event tonight in West Virginia, and how do you view it online?
Trump’s campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday evening 29 September 2018 at 19:00 Eastern Coast time.
The Trump West Virginia campaign event can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is probably talking about this week's hearings of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense about the allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate's vote of confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the matter.
However, the main aim of the campaign series is to help the Republicans, who are facing difficult elections in November, to raise new momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign manager said that the aim of these five events next week was to “encourage volunteers and supporters when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority belonging to them in the Senate and the House of Representatives," mediated Reuters.
“Controlling the Congress is so important to the President’s agenda that Trump travels to as many states as possible when he dives into the fast election campaign season," told Reuters a spokesman for Trump’s campaign who did not want to mention his name.
Tonight’s campaign event, which is planned to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, can bring back supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be reflected in Pittsburgh media,” says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time Trump visits West Virginia in the last month. This is a state where he received more than 40 percent of the voters' votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate from West Virginia, who is in charge of the rankings on the basis of polls.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President has come to stimulate his results,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team has enough nerve to compete, keeping hopes high before Sundays alone games
After three one-sided sessions, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were sometimes just what Ryder Cup needed.
The volatile turning point pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sport, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
So, where do they think the turning point is now?
“They led by six points, which has now become four, so I think that this might be a turning point in a small way," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, that is clear, as it is managed by four points and there are 12 other points in play.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they do not have enough wind in their sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each received three points out of four.
Spieth has been stunning in both the tea and the green, setting an example.
These victories from the throat became louder and louder with each round, overshadowing the determining putt, which would have led to the fourth match after he and Thomas were down with two.
His putt that won the fight on the 15th sent a similar cry that showed a man's belief that the Americans weren't out of the race yet.
“You just have to be more focused and worry about your fight," said Spieth.
That's all the players can do.
Eighteen holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have on Ryder Cup's indisputable stars Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but beloved couple are four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit Bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine Friday mornings.
This game and the way their energy flows to as noisy a crowd as it gets back from there strengthens the view that the players they compete with on Sunday, and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, there is no player known as Fleetwood or Molinari to confirm a possible European victory.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk of Europe's glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, when he was married to Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the first nine dug a Spaniard and a Swede into a hole so deep that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But there's no one on Saturday to get you out of the hole.
Four-balls and even games are very appealing to look closely at the interaction between couples, advice given to each other, lost advice and how the way can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken the lead for the last day, but this Quartet session showed that the US team has had enough nerve to fight in which some, especially Americans, have doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of Ryder Cup 10-6
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a good head start, leading 10-6 in front of the United States after Saturday's four-balls and even games.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two victories in front of the struggling Tiger Woods to raise their current score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the cup lost in Hazeltine, ruled the American side in the morning's four-ball, winning the 3-1 series.
The United States offered more resistance in doubles, winning two games, but they could not make up for the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. Together with Molinari, who after this boom weekend is called Molliwood, they are the second couple to win four points in Ryder Cup's history.
Having destroyed Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed random brilliance, but now lost 29 of his four-balls and doubles 19, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested up for four-balls this morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world ranking.
Europe did not succeed, even though the competition was held in pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
The triple champion, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set two points as the benchmark for Americans on Saturday.
They won a certain victory over 2-1 Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-balls, later returning and winning Poulter and Rory McIllroyd 4-3 in doubles after losing two openings.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has the team come back from a four-point deficit, going to single games, even though as owners Furyk's side only needs a tie to keep the cup.
Although the second best in two days, after Sunday’s counterattack, they seem to fail.
North Korea says "no way" they're not disarming themselves unilaterally because of a lack of trust.
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that the continuing restrictions deepened their mistrust of the United States and that the state would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the World Organisation, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken “significant goodwill measures” over the last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we do not see that the United States has responded,” he said.
“Without trusting the United States, our country lacks security security, and under such circumstances we are in no way willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
Although Ri repeated the complaints of North Korea's acquaintances regarding Washington's resistance to the "progressive" approach to nuclear denuclearisation, which rewards North Korea when taking gradual steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject the unilateral withdrawal of nuclear weapons, as Mr Pjongjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump at the first summit held in Singapore between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader on 12 June, when Kim promised to move towards the “renunciation of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has requested the formal end of the war in Korea in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to relax the strict international restrictions that are being used against North Korea.
“The United States is calling for the “first withdrawal of nuclear weapons” and increasing the pressure of restrictions in order to achieve their goal in a forced manner, even opposing the declaration that the war will end," said Ri.
“It is more likely that restrictions will bring us to our knees than a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continuing restrictions are exacerbating our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for Kim and Trump's second summit, which the US leader at the UN earlier this week emphasised.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the meeting between the three Kim and South Korean leaders Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: “If South Korea were one of the parties to the nuclear weaponisation issue, not the US, the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock.”
However, Ri's speech differed sharply from that of last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to address the US mainland with North Korean missiles after Mr. Bad President Trump called Kim "the rocket man" on his suicide mission.
Last year, the North Korean Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely to Kim's skies, praised him for his courage to take steps towards disarming, but added that there is still much to be done and that the restrictions must remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons are abandoned.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a timetable for this, saying: “Does it take two years, three years, or five months? It doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward the measures taken by Pjongjang.
At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeal told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “The Security Council's restrictions must continue to be enforced forcefully and unfailing until we can fully and definitively confirm the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions on North Korea in an attempt to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
The pompom met Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Bombope has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
Following a meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him for “gang-like demands” within just a few hours.
North Korea promised to dismantle rockets and nuclear facilities at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States were to implement "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim had told him that by “the corresponding measures” he meant the security guarantees promised in Trump’s Singapore and the move towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to combat a growing aggressive culture where they study in caffeine-rich night-long learning marathons.
Students who love the academics of the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to the basics of caring for themselves.
Professor Charles Czeisler, a designer of this course, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and the Women's Hospital, thought it was the first of its kind in the United States.
He encouraged the creation of the course after giving a talk on the subject of how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why is it only now that they tell me about it in my last year of school?’
He said that no one had ever told him the importance of sleep -- it knocked me out," he explained to Telegraph.
The course, which came to the curriculum for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes and also contribute to their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine, and head of university health care, said that the university decided to take a course in the curriculum after finding that the students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the working week.
The hourly course covers a number of interaction tasks.
One section presents a picture of the dormitory. It allows students to click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books and explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how lack of sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of the custom of going to bed.
The second section explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, along with the inter-agency symbols, encourages participants to reflect on their daily practice.
“We know that this does not change the behaviour of students immediately.
However, we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, there is still pride in learning marathons at night, adding that modern techniques and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is still a growing problem.
“Ensuring an adequate quality sleeper should be a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he added. “This even helps to prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to hunger, making a person constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler to create a course, having attended one of his classes in the previous year, his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all graduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set the alarm clock for both going to bed and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" generated by electronic screens and LED lighting, as this could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Menga Gate defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest game when Dolly Menga's strike, sent from the side by Steven Gerrard, brought 1-0 victory to Livingston.
The Ibrox side hoped to win its first guest victory since February, when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a leader, eight points behind the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before halftime, and Rangers' poor readiness couldn't recover from it.
The Rangers will fall to sixth, Livingston will rise to third, under Hibernian with only one goal.
For the Rangers, the trouble may not be over yet, because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound treatment after he was hit by an apparently discarded object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side which led to the semifinals of Ayris and Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, went on at the same time as Liv 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with the way his well-trained boys suffocated their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have been more dominant in the village, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored the goal in the second opening minute when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the quarterback didn't take his chance.
The deep free kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but its defence partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide arch of the rear pole.
The Rangers did gain control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he ran into Steven Lawless on the 15th of the game, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy the Columbian player's complaint.
The Rangers managed to make only two shots to the target during the first half, but former Ibrox gatekeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned about Lassana Coulibaly's main strike or Ovie Ejaria's cause.
Although the opening of Liv's 34 minutes may have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely because of their performance.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to contain Jacobs' deep, heavy performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his peace and picked out a Menga who just finished the plan.
Gerrard acted during the break, trading Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost paid off when the forward split Morelos, but impressive Kelly swooped to stop her seat.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the kind of game that suits those where Lithgow and Halket picked up long balls.
Holt's side could have promoted its leadership at the final stage, but McGregor stood firm, impeding Jacobs before Lithgow hit the corner with a big arch.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, applied for another punishment when he went to hell with Jacobs, which Thomson once again did not satisfy.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and LONDING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From that scientific foundation, Geiger's counter also became the foundation of popular culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado Watches, where these seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were in the lead:
Man: “What the hell is this? ”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these headphones, it is possible to hear the bottling of atoms released from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: “Don’t say it, it's a mess!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cheat cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cheat cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know fraudulent cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them from the laboratory
They then “see” the protein they share for many cancers and are injected back
The study shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine to teach the immune system to detect fraudulent cells lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are converted in the laboratory to receive a “see” protein that has spread to different HER2 cancers and then injected back into these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. State Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 “leads the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where patients are taken from immune cells and taught to target cancer cells, has been used to treat a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West started with Trump's supporting tribe, wearing a MAGA hat live on SNL.
That didn't go very well.
You will receive a derogatory whistle choir towards Kanye West in the Saturday Night Live studio, after his mixed speech, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced his application for the same position in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, called Ghost Town, where he wore a hat with a letter from Make America Great, he began shouting against the Democrats and repeating his support for Trump.
“I have spoken so much to white people who ask me, ‘ How can you like Trump, he is a racist? ’
"If I were so concerned about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood celebrity joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual violence.
Although this broadcast was not broadcast, West's noise frames were loaded into the social media of Comic Chris Rock.
It's been unclear if Rock tried to mock West with his post.
West also complained to the audience that it was quite difficult behind the scenes in connection with his hat.
“They teased me backstage.
They told me not to go in there with my hat on.
They were teasing me!
And then they say I'm drowned in a place," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place? I’m putting on my Superman cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
His comments triggered the dismay of the viewers at least twice, and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. According to Variety, one person published: “The whole studio remained dead quiet.”
West had been brought to the show at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande because the singer's former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, was dead a few days earlier.
West amazed many with the song “I Love It, ” which he presented as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one brave soul: THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING TO THE PEOPLE."
But the host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "who she is, and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose NOT to reward (buying my music or dress or supporting his “art”) someone who I think believes and spreads a view of the world that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “the former Kanye West.”
She's not the first singer to change her name by following Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also the rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly deceased musical legend Prince, who changed his name into a symbol.
Indictment of attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the case took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
The fame of the troon game Kit Harington doesn't approve of the fanciful masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-flashing role in Jon Snowina HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But an actor (31) defys the stereotypes of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that "something has gone wrong" and raised the question of how to solve the great masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie in her troon game (31), admitted that she feels “very strongly” that this problem needs attention.
“I personally feel quite strongly that we have gone wrong with manhood somewhere,” he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise in masculinity of the fang, as superman characters are shown there.
He continued: “What is innate, and what are taught?
What they teach on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be just like that when they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because obviously something has gone wrong for the young men."
In the poll, he also admitted that after the end of the series the following summer, he would never participate in any of the Throne Games, saying that he would be “enough with his battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit Sam Shepard has been participating in the revival of True West, a story about the filmmaker and his robber brother.
The actor recently announced that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to do with the Game of the Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” she said.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's character Jon Snow, in an award-winning fantasy series with Emmy.
The couple married Leslie in a family home in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased exponentially to 14%.
According to health professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
Some 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases have come from sex, changing the past.
HIV spread in some parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had fallen to almost zero, as confirmed by the Chinese health officials at the conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the old-fashioned values of the country, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases relate to the inadequate sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to use universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking the data of the GOP Senator, saying that these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the US representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that his employee had posted the personal data of three Republican US senators on the websites of the legislators Wikipedia.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are disseminated by "ultra-right" trolls and their websites.
“Valid, lies and even more despicable lies,” said Waters in his Twitter statement.
The published information allegedly contained the home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utah).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and gave out the information of the Waters member of the staff, reported by Hill.
“This unfounded statement is a complete and absolute lie,” continued Waters.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and safety are at risk because of their fraudulent and false claims, are not in any way responsible for its information.
This unfounded statement is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters’ application was quickly evaluated on the Internet, including the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is due to anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that he has a feeling that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
If someone's accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They mustn't be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who stands for Waters in the middle of the election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It was important when it came to the truth,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities regarding their fraudulent claims.”
“We will do everything we can to find out the criminals,” he continued, “and that they will be legally held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.”
Film Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Undersupplyed Rowan Atkinson spy-parody
It is now customary to look for the meaning of Brexit in all new British films and this seems to be particularly appropriate in Johnny English's action comedy parody series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and became a follow-up to Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is it humorous to make fun of ourselves on how obviously stupid we are in the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with rubber face has received permission to do things again in a ragged way - and that this wide comical creation is intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, this is a secret agent who, despite his strange pretentious smoothie glamour, reminds a bit of Clouseau, a little Mr Bean, and a little character who gave the tone to the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
It is also based on a traveler and an international mystery Atkinson, once played in forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
There's only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE movie.
I liked the approach to Johnny English's helicopter when he was wearing medieval armor and the helicopter's wings gave him a quick crack against his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for making a physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and strangely redundant, especially when “serious” spy movies such as 007 and Mission Impossible are also self-confidently offering comedy.
It seems that this humor is intended for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's clever adventures are not as resourceful and focused as Atkinson's silent films as Beanina.
Today, the assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is always valid.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated the British top secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British secret policemen, thus disappointing the local agent - regrettably a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a solemn and distraught figure who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this perfectly, but there is not much in the script to work on.
His intelligence advisors suggest that since all active spies are threatened, he must recall someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in a fancy institution, teaching secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers a school of rock-type spy school.
English is flown back to Whitehall for emergency information and reunited with its former long-time partner, Bough, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the shame stains of his Majesty's Secret Service are once again in action, in places with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the paw of a charismatic tech-billionaire who claims to be able to solve all British computer troubles: the unfortunate Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their jaunted odyssey: hiding themselves as waitresses, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos, in secret, on board the Volta luxury yacht; and English initiates a real mess when it tries to use a virtual reality headset to explore the interior of the Volta house.
No brakes are used in this last section, but as sweet and hasty as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV taste.
Pretty mediocre stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I caught myself thinking: does the British film industry really not have a role to play for Rowan Atkinson that would be fair to his talent?
The Labour Party denies drawing up a plan where the British work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a pivotal plan that foresees the British to work four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
The Party would like the company's superiors to pass on the savings received through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the employees by giving them one extra day off.
So the employees would have a three-day weekend - but they would get the same salary.
According to the source, this idea would fit into the party's economic agenda, and so the state is going to be tilted to the benefit of the workers.
Thursday's working week has been approved by the Congress of the Trade Union so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
The source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a review of the Bill will be announced before the end of the year.
“It does not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits with the party’s approach to economic rebalancing both for the benefit of employees and the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, because the Greens Party also promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, the Labour Party as a whole does not support this endeavour.
The Labour Party spokesperson stated: “Four days of working week is not party politics and the party is not discussing it.”
Undersecretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to clarify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he's determined to take back power from the "expected leaders" and "profit-servants" of the utilities.
The Undersecretary’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to regain all their stakes, as the Labour Party could make “depreciations” in connection with a perceived misdemeanour.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10% of private equity to employees instead of giving annual bonuses of up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say on 60 Minutes, whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on the application to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the conclusions of the Bureau could affect the termination of support for Republican senators.
In a Sunday poll, the co-host of the 60 Minutes program, Scott Pelley, asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I was going to be questioned. I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, firm, and unambiguous."
Graham's voice seems rockproof.
“In my decision, I am certain about Brett Kavanaugh and that can only be changed in a bombshell," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I do not know how this happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all those whom he has named could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the annual music event will be held at the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has a tremendously impressive participation in celebrities and an equally impressive goal: to eradicate poverty from the world.
Now the 7th Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only enjoying singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the global poverty project Global Coverty Project. It is an international law firm that hopes to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform several tasks or volunteer activities, send an e-mail to some world leaders, call or do something important to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are 12 more years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to take action, or is it just another click team where people feel they are doing something important by signing an application online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in an attempt to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to report more than USD 37 billion in commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from their activities, with at least USD 10 billion already paid or funded.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the UK-based partnership between investors and implementers, The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to ‘helping to exploit the full potential of children’, promising Rwanda to provide 35 million dollars to help the country stop malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historical footnote to social injustice," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the crowd during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that, following more than 5000 activities in the UK, which called for improvements in maternal and child nutrition, the government announced a financing project for the Power of Nutrition, reaching 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, which asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It’s a long and hard road — sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-partheid movements that lie before us, we are confident of our success because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a couple of performers who will attend this year's event in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy's "barrier" to prevent Russia's energy exports - Minister of the Interior
According to Washington Examiner, Washington may use its Navy if necessary to prevent Russia’s energy market being captured, including in the Middle East, has been published by US Minister of the Interior, Ryan Zinke.
Zinke argued that Russia's participation in Syria, especially if it works at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to investigate new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the watershed of southern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States will have this opportunity to ensure, with the help of our Navy, that the sea lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he added.
Zinke’s statement was addressed to the participants of the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance. It is a non-profit organisation that represents the "voice of the US energy consumer".
He went to Washington to compare his approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
“Iran and Russia have more or less economic choice, amplification and fuel replacement,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when Trump's government is tasked with increasing the export of LNG to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump Administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to reject the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow’s “container”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of USD 11 billion, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak at a meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has been defeated by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Association (BDI), following the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says the Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was seriously considering running for president in the middle of the election.
At the town hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering his application.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes the first lady,” said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren also assessed the actions of President Donald Trump in City Hall, saying that he “will take the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has issued criticisms against Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “Of course, before the vote, we need an FBI investigation.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters do not think that he should run for office in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe poll, 58% of the "probable" Massachusetts voters thought that the senator should not run for office.
32% supported such an application.
The poll showed more support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38% supported a possible candidate and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 application include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide January, announced Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes the PTSD from Track Palin at Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who feel the consequences and wounds of the PTSD with which our soldiers return,” he told the audience at Donald Trump’s meeting in Oktaham, Tulsa.
Palin called the arrest of his son “the elephant in the room” and said, in connection with his son and other war veterans, that “they come back a little differently, they come back when they’re scared, they come back wondering if there’s enough respect for what the soldiers and the airmen and all the other militarymen have given to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and Dan Bennett, spokesperson of Wasilla Police Department, said he was accused of domestic violence against a woman, interference in a domestic violence case report and possession of a weapon in a drunken state.
18 states and Columbia challenge a new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge of a new US policy banning asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of 18 countries and regions made a brief statement by court friends in Washington to support the provocative policy of asylum seekers, NBC News stated.
The applicant’s full name, Grace v Sessions, was not published in August, which was presented by the Association of American Civil Liberties against Union policy.
The woman said that her accomplice “and her violent gangmen’s sons” abused her, but U.S. officials refused to accept her asylum application on 20 July.
He was detained in Texas.
The state lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing a large number of US asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Council of Appeals for Migrants, which allowed undocumented migrants to flee from domestic violence for asylum applications.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the Columbia Region, said in his Friday statement that the new policy "will oversee national, Union and international law for decades".
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be resolved according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application and such a requirement violates this principle," stated the court friends’ brief statement.
In a brief statement, lawyers also claimed that the ban on immigrants’ entry would harm the US economy, saying that they would probably become entrepreneurs and "requisite workers".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June no longer to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“The asylum application is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear in relation to race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his communication of 11 June.
The purpose of the shelter was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertainment rescue operations in Palu, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
The situation was increasingly threatening for survivors.
“The situation is very tense,” said a 35-year-old mother named Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever in the small boy’s torn-up Palu city evacuation center.
“Every minute, new people arrive with an ambulance.
There's not enough clean water."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting out things that were soaked and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that had been damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude were overloaded.
Some injured people, including Dwi Haris, who was in a broken back and upper arm, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated outdoors because of strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recalled how a strong earthquake shook his fifth - floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“I didn’t have time to save myself.
I think I was pressed against the wall in the ruins," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “bullying with adverts”
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement under the US daily news regarding the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American journalism to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the addendum paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Registeris - the newspaper with the largest circulation in the state of Iowa - after China was accused of intervening in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which is denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other's import tariffs are adjusted.
The Chinese countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to capture exporters from states such as Iowa, as they supported the Republican Party of Trump, the experts from China and the USA have explained.
U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, as well as China's largest exporter of agricultural products, Terry Branstad, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
In the Sunday Des Moines Register opinion article, Branstad wrote: “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing campaign ads in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the expensive American freedom of expression and free press practice, placing its paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, there are only limited voices in the Beijing street kiosk and there are no real differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he added.
He added that one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that the Republicans will dispose of female voters before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans await and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see setbacks during the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been high, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School belonging to Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday to The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last-minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI was enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said the senior advisor to the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters "November is coming!" repeated during the demonstration in their Senate corridor because the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to proceed with the candidacy of Kavanaugh despite Dr Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic announced.
“Democratic zeal and influence are beginning to fall off schedule," told the news site unofficial political analyst Stu Rothenberg.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among suburban female voters and 18-29-year-old younger voters who do not like the President and often abstain."
Even before Ford's public statement describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts predicted setbacks as Republicans move forward with assurance.
“It has become very confusing for GOP,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not only about the Commission's vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put in office, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it," brought Prioritys to the attention of the US (a group that helps to select democrats) leader Guy Cecil on the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided, who believe in the testimony of Ford and who Kavanaugh, but slightly more in support of the first.
YouGov's new poll showed that 41% of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, or probably believed in it, while 35% said that they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations submitted by Ford and at least one other indictment against Deborah Ramirez, reported by the Guardian.
Ford took an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his reproductive organs when they attended a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is about to start a new Internet that will face Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee launched a start-up company trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that will build the Berners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s objective was “world governance”.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the start-up company.
"This is an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data collection” or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are all available in one browser and simultaneously.
Its personal online database is unique because the user can choose who will have access to this information.
The company calls it ‘for the granting of personal authorisation through data’.
According to John Bruce, head of the company, Inrupt's idea is that the company would bring forth sources, processes and relevant skills to help make Solid available to all.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project under contract, and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not talk to “Facebook and Google whether to introduce a complete change if all their business models were fully supported overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post published on Saturday at Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's aim was to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute remain the founder and director.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The commemorative stone of Victoria’s cross was opened in World War I
The only church in England that received Victoria’s cross during World War I celebrated its 100th anniversary in its hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann fought his badge on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But he died four days later by a sniper bullet and did not know that he had received the highest British military badge.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it would be “genially symbolic ” if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s prized battle.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 “through a very thick pile of fog and rifles and machine guns.”
Later, he hurried to the line of attack and carried it forward with “the greatest gallant ” before he hurried to one of the machine guns alone and knocked out three opponents.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - when only a little over a month was left until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s activities were “something I know I can never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann placed a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood's conangel youth band.
Michael Vann said that he had “the great honor of participating in this parade” and added that“the presence and support of so many people shows that the true hero is appreciated.”
MMA fans were up all night to watch Bellator 206, but all you saw was Pig Peppa.
Imagine you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, but you won't be shown this main event.
The San Jose match contained 13 battles, including six from the main cards, and it was broadcast live on channel 5 in the UK all night long.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers had their mouths open because Pig Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many were not thrilled, especially those who had stayed awake until the early hours to see this battle.
On Twitter, a fan described the transition to a children's comic book as "a sick joke."
“It is a government regulation that at 6:00 the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to the children’s programme,” explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator on marketing and communication issues, when asked about the transfer.
“‘Bitch Peppa’, yes.’
President of Bellator Scott Coker said that they were going to work on their timetable to take greater account of UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about playback now, I think we can solve this problem in the future," said Coker.
“But when it is 6 a.m. Sunday morning, we can’t do this until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical breach.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We're showing five instead of six fights - as we usually do - we tried to offer more fans, and we just went over time.
This is a terrible situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “undervaluable” in connection with sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling more inferior because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation for success.
A 24-year-old guy said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everyone isn't like him."
By participating in the Lauren Laverne Radio 4 broadcast on Desert Island Discs, she said she was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
As a parent, he also changed his attitude toward winning the Olympic Games, feeling that it was no longer so important.
The usual long-term host Kirsty Young had to take a few months off because of her illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt less valuable growing up than the others, because it wasn't socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, these feelings are that I am not worthy and feel different, giving me power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth something and didn't disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The dual winner of the Bronze Olympics has become the leader of the highly valued LGBT campaign, using his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to turn to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give hope to others.
The triple world champion said that falling in love with a man - the US film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "screw him as a surprise."
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but she said the age difference was never a problem.
"If you go through so much when you were young" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all prospects" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, everything had to do with winning the gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011, after the diagnosis of a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father refused to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Father, you can’t sit in the front row because by then you’d be gone,’ he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the Bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of the home crowds at the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling than that,” he said.
It also inspired her first choice of song - Heather Small Proud - which helped her prepare for the Olympic Games and still gives her chicken skin.

Out of shape, Mickelson was removed from the Ryder Cup game on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson is setting a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his uniform to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays record 12 times every two years at an event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday doubles and four-balls.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as he has often been for the US, the five-time winner divided his day in two, being a cheerleader and working on his game in the hope of improving it.
Never the most direct hitter, not even at the peak of his career, is not suitable for a 48-year-old especially to play on a narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long hard track punishes constantly lost blows.
And if the square itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will be facing the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari on Sunday, his ninth race, who has joined forces with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his competitions this week.
If the Americans, behind by four points at the start of 12 single games, start hot, Mickelson's competition may be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he didn't have much else to add.
“He fully understood his part today, patted me on my shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder, and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk added.
“He’s very confident.
He's a celebrity and he's given so much to our teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more than that, but it went this way, and we had to choose a path like this.
He wants to be out like everyone else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the player most involved in Ryder Cup games.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never met his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said that his presence has provided an additional spiritual contribution to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s mocking, he’s funny, he likes to have fun with people and he’s just great in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week, and it was nice to see it.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that a great head start may soon disappear
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that the great leadership of Ryder Cup's last day at the beginning of individual games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
The Dane went public at the 1997 competition in Valderrama, where with Captain Seve Ballesterus the Americans had a five-point head start, but when they reached the finish line, it was drastically reduced, only 141⁄2 was won: 131⁄2.
“You even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderram; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderram, where we won, it came very close," said Bjorn in the picture after winning the Class of 2018 5:3 on Friday and with yesterday’s success at 10:6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole crew that it could happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get the score.
We have a goal, which is to win the cup, and so let's focus on it.
I have always said that I will focus on 12 players on our side, but we are very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not getting ahead of myself.
Tomorrow, we're dealing with a whole new set of obstacles.
Tomorrow, personal performance counts, so it's different.
It's nice to be with the opposite player, if things go well, but if you're there in person, you'll be tested to the full extent as a golfer.
That's the message you need to send to the players - do your best tomorrow.
Now, if you leave your partner behind, he'll have to go and take care of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will act better personally than his opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both in the last few days, being part of the Brookline victory team before becoming a part of the defeat of Europe's defeat of the Medinah miracle.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put everything in their game on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start hot, like in Brookline and like in Medinah.
If the momentum goes in one direction, it puts great pressure on the average competitions.
We'll set up our team accordingly, and we'll put the boys on the field in a way we'll feel like it's gonna be a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the race, and he's up against the best of Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the race.
“I put my boys in this line because I think we are well covered,” said Bjorn about his choice of single games.
The new German warship has been postponed again.
The latest fast sailboat in the German Navy should have come into use in 2014, replacing the old Cold War warships, but this will not happen before next year due to faulty systems and increased costs as a snowball, the local media reported.
The introduction of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg high-speed sailing ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to a military press release published in Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy as early as 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 replace the obsolete Bremen class with fast sailboats.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some cloaking technologies such as radar, infrared and audible signal reduction.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to send the latest high speed sailboats out of the home port for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that top-level warships - which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad - are getting old by the time they take up their service.
The failed F125 express sailboat appeared on the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the navy's sent the ship back to the shipbuilder since it was received.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media quoted a number of important “software and hardware shortages” which rendered the warship unusable if they had been used on a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important as Baden-Württemberg class ships are managed by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the senior Bremen class's fast sailing crew.
It also appeared that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the capability of the Navy to add to future innovations.
The 7,000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are probably twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project, including team training, becomes a problem.
It has been said to amount to EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the newer high speed sailboats are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of the German navy is diminishing.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the Navy actually had “run-outable ships”.
The official said that this issue had grown over time as a snowball because old ships were eliminated, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's high-speed sailboats could join the Navy.
National Trust explores the secret life of bats
The purpose of the new study in the Scottish Highlands is to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for their food.
It is hoped that the results will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future protective measures.
Research by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland monitors conventional and soprano pipes in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders are placed in the main areas of the area to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers also conduct field studies using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency of bat call and the activity of the species.
A habitat map and a report will then be created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole, the population of bats has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affects their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and the chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful to catch prey than their eyes.
They use complex echo-location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Throughout the country, the NTS, responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, surveys, and sometimes save.
The organization has even created the first and only special bat reserve in Scotland in the Threave area of Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of the ten Scottish bats live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says this area is the perfect territory for them.
"In Threave we have a large area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great place to live.
But there is still much to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us to understand better what they need."
It stresses the importance of checking bats prior to the start of care activities in real estate, as the unwanted destruction of one pregnancy and childbirth site can kill up to 400 females and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disrupt or destroy them.
Scottish Officer of the Bat Defence Union Elisabeth Ferrell has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we simply do not know many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges, while lawyers plan to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected the rape charges against him as a “false mouth, ” saying that people “want to advertise themselves ” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rape of American woman Kathryn Mayorga in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He has allegedly paid a woman EUR 330 643,10 not to talk about the incident, Der Spiegel announced on Friday.
Turning to his 142 million trackers in Instagram live after hours of indictment, Ronaldo (33) reported that these were “fake news”.
‘No, no, no, no, no.
Today's story is a lie," said five times the winner of Ballon d'Or to the news.
They want to advertise themselves with my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for “unauthorised disclosure of suspicion of privacy”.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player is seeking compensation for “moral harm, which corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged case took place in a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, in June 2009.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player’s hotel room, where he allegedly was raped on the basis of documents submitted by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99 percent good man, ” one percent of whom failed.
The documents suggest that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it was not unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she was afraid of “the tax” and was concerned about “the public downfall”.
Now a 34-year-old woman says she's now trying to refute the solution because the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid and this summer he moved to Italy in connection with the giant Juve 100 million euros transaction.
Brexit: The UK can begin to regret the car manufacturers leaving forever
The United Kingdom would regret it forever if it lost its position as the leader of the automotive industry after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop their production at a plant near Derby in Burnaston.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the stagnation of border crossings without a Brexit agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that when Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see the production process stopped in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without agreement, with concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says he's shutting down the Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
The Toyota production line works as needed, where spare parts arrive from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement of 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, may cause delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day's supply in its Derbyshire plant, which is why production must be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers' plan for future EU relations was “precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.”
“We need an agreement. We want the best solution that will allow what we want, not only to take advantage of the current success, but to take full advantage of the opportunity,” he said to the BBC Radio 4 Show Today.
“The evidence not only about Toyota but also about other producers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the long term it was warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a representative of the United Trade Union who worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our experience that if jobs are lost, they will not return.
Government spokesperson said: “We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says the White House.
A meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein with Donald Trump's major contributions may be postponed for another week, as the fight against the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein is following the work of Commissioner Robert Mueller, who is investigating the intervention of the Russian elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump is firing the Deputy Attorney General and thereby endangering Mueller's independence, Washington's rumors have been sparked for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of wiretap tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm that.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, stating he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a meeting with a Senate Judiciary hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave in-laws.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump's spokesman Sarah Sanders showed up on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the things that are going on in connection with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep the press up to date, as always."
Some journalists would argue that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not the result of deliberately disillusioning TV journalists, although he added: “I do not dispute the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President will do more questions and answers than any president before him," he said without adding evidence: “We have looked at these numbers.”
Questioning continues, Sanders confirmed, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this a lot and you have seen how we have done it in the last few weeks, so it will take place during the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York City, the president may have shown why, before meeting the journalists, he was on the coast and sometimes odd-looking.
Health Minister wrote to EU staff in NHS in Scotland about Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working in the NHS of Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish to be present after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent her letter when the UK left the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of established status for EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In summer, negotiations have continued on the withdrawal between the UK and the EU, heading towards the expected decisions of this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I now wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every worker, regardless of his nationality.
Partners from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head trauma
Christion Abercrombie, a supporter of Tennessee State Tigers, underwent an emergency surgery after his head injury and defeat on Saturday 31:27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, published Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told the press that the injury happened just before halftime.
“He fell on his side and just collapsed,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on their side before they put him on the stretcher and took him off the court for further inspection.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center had ended.
Harris added that there are no details yet on the type/range of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
A second-year student with a red shirt, Abercrombie, was in Tennessee State for his first season after he crossed Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before he left the game, which made a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp tax when buying real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help the homeless under new Tory plans
This step will disarm Corby's attempt to attract young voters.
The stamp duty is levied on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance hopes it will generate up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The movement is considered to be an attempt to disarm Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable housing and target high-income people.
The stamp duty is levied on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom by directing additional money to the government's desire to combat homelessness.
The additional fee - which is in addition to this stamp duty, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on other homes and purchases related to rendition - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will generate up to GBP 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the property purchased in London is owned by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get under their feet when acquiring housing.
Many of the rich regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" thanks to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
A new policy will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high when they bought land but did not use it, and called on May to give up affordable home quotas in order to correct the “housing shame” of Britain.
Corbyn has announced an eye-catching reform of housing, including rent control and ending the harassment of innocent people.
He also wants to give councils greater powers in building new homes.
May said: “Last year, I promised that as Prime Minister, I would devote myself to restoring the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, can easily buy homes as hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too distant and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland”
Sunderlan leader Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's leader at some point.
The Scotsman (42) welcomes the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which is currently third in League One, with only 3 points behind it.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after he took St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B, and that was it," Ross told the BBC Scotland show Sportsound.
“But I grew up with my father watching Scotland in Hampden, and it’s always something that has pulled me back.
This opportunity will only come if I succeed in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as head of Sunderland have been Dick Advokaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
A former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid of such great and well-known names, having previously endured both in Barnsley and in Ipswich Town.
"For me, success now is when I can get this club to the Champions League."
Due to its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Champions League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I only see myself successful if I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has only worked as a leader for three years, being previously Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among Hearts' senior staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from level three and turned St Mirren's lowest position into the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical during his career.
“It was a real crossroads,” he recalled the takeover of Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership was more suitable for me than playing.
It feels weird because I did it, got a reasonable income and enjoyed some highlights.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to do every week.
I am still doing this in the light of the pressure and pressure of my work, but management just feels better.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable now than ever in adulthood."

According to the study, the best time for a pint on Saturday is 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of pubs in British distress, but the pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the turnover of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of CGA’s business consultancy company, compiled these figures: “The continuing sunshine and England’s longer participation in the World Championships meant that July was similar to June when pubs grew by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants went even harder.
In June, 1.8% of the reduced restaurant trade deteriorated even further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded the most successfully and restaurants try to please the worst.
Food - based pubs also suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while the sales of food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the greatest factor when it comes to sales outside the home market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant chains continue to fight, although the fall in sales by 4.8 percent compared to last year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressure.
Long and hot summers could not have come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time will show whether the moderate temperatures we have experienced in August provide some necessary relief."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing down of brand-related institutions.
The sales monitor of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion and is a benchmark for an established industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
The study concluded that one of the five children, some 11 years of age, had secret social media accounts that they were hiding from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 gymnasts found “fake Insta” leaf growth
The news raised the fear that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a basic account to show their parents.
The study came to the conclusion that one of the five children, some of them only 11 years old, created secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey carried out among 20,000 gymnasts found a marked increase in the “fake Insta” accounts (reference to the Instagram image-sharing page).
The news raised the fear that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a “core account ” designed to show their parents and accepted by them.
One discoverer of his 13-year-old daughter's secret paper saw that a teenager invited others to rape him.
The Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year-olds had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged the existence of personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It is disturbing to see so many teenagers being tempted to create accounts on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eelidh Doyle will be the spokesman for the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director at the annual board meeting of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most commended tracker and Chairman Ian Beattie described what had happened as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his broad international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh is respected throughout Scotland, the UK and other sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from inviting him to management," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I wish to be a spokesman for athletes and I hope that I can contribute to Scotland’s sport in real terms and contribute to its development.”
An American who won four Olympic batteries at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games at 200 metres and 400 metres and now often shares his opinion at the BBC was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I recover, and if so, to what extent, only time will tell.
I have worked hard, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I am already taking speed classes!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising that compares women to cows divides the Internet into two
The breast-pump company has shared the Internet with two camps that compare breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows.
To celebrate the world’s first silent portable breast pump presentation, a consumer-oriented technology company, Elvie, published an ironic music video like an advertisement to present the freedom that this new pump gives to wanting mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and sing, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see my tail" and "If you didn't notice, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The verse repeats: “Pump, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.”
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page has given rise to conflicting opinions on the Internet.
77,000 video viewers with thousands of comments disagree, many of them say that it illuminates the back of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that their children will be stolen from them with countless days after birth", wrote one.
Elvie’s breast pump does not stick into the eye of breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter said: “Accordingly traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use these children to advertise the breast pump of mothers who can keep them?"
Someone added, "Advertisement completely incomprehensible."
Some are in favour of advertising, and a woman thought it was hilarious.
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I still breast-feeded.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but let's take it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertisement (often in their workplaces or toilets) for mothers who pump themselves and feel themselves like cows.
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all danced in bras with non-obvious pumps.
The idea behind the campaign is that many women who pump breast milk feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, no wires or pipes, and does not stand out as a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even go outdoors while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and irritating introduction.
With the possibility of expressing women and comparing cows in the dairy industry, we wanted to highlight the pumping of breasts and all its challenges, while presenting in an entertaining and familiar key the extraordinary sense of freedom created by the new pump.
This isn't the first time the news has covered Elvie's pump.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children carrying the product of the designer Marta Jakubowski appeared on the scene.
Thousands of migrants' children quietly went to tent camp on the border of Texas
The number of children of arrested migrants has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and politics enforced by Trump’s administrator have made it difficult with the help of the sponsors of the founding of children.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents, and they are afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country by requiring custody of the child.
The risk increased in June, when national authorities reported that possible sponsors and other domestic adults could provide fingerprints and data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, admitted to Congress last week that the agency arrested a dozen people who requested financial support for non-inclusive minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of sponsors or sponsors’ households are illegally staying in the country and a large number of them have criminal backgrounds.
So we will continue to pursue them," said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials enacted new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being arrested.
Many defend their legal content before a judge by videoconferencing instead of attending.
Those unfit for release shall be promptly expelled.
According to the asylum workers and the reports from the system published in recent months - the longer a child is in custody, the more likely they are to get nervous or depressed, which could lead to violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, these concerns are more relevant in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficulties may be overlooked by size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without sufficient time to get used to the feeling or to say goodbye to friends could lead to trauma, with which many are already struggling.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of the US, French and Turkish occupying forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
According to Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of countering terrorism and are being dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he said in the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that Syria’s “war against terrorism is almost over”. Since 2011, more than 360 000 people have died and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight in this holy war until we have cleansed the entire area of Syria” from terrorist groups as well as from “the external forces of any illegal presence.”
The United States has some 2000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
In France, there are more than 1,000 powers in a war - torn country.
Speaking about war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and he blamed the spread of incomprehensible fears preventing the arrival of refugees to some Western countries.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return,” he said.
“They are politicising something that is merely a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no rehabilitation aid will be given to Syria until there is an agreement ending the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create the last rebel base in the Idlib buffer zone, has provided an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the widespread capture of Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that there were "explicit deadlines" in the Treaty and expressed hope that military action would hit the fighters of the Jihadists, including Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who would be "killed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to persuade the new Committee of members of the government and opposition to plan the post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for the election.
Moualem made demands for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump is elected for another term of office
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if the dismissal and scandal have not before ended his presidency, as the liberal viewers probably want.
Which would undoubtedly be "the most exciting end of the president's office!"
At the moment, the viewers are showing no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-hour ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at rush hour. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has increased. The Rachel Maddow Show has been held high by 3.5 million viewers via cable on the MSNBC programme Rachel Maddow Show.
“It is a tension that we are involved in because we do not understand it,” said the leader of ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor” about the secretary of government who will be president when the attack destroys the parliament building.
Nell Scovell, who is an experienced comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, is another theory.
He remembers the taxi ride before the 2016 elections in Boston.
The driver told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He said he made me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
All this chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, not as on TV, Washington's rumors may be fatal to the future of Roe v. Wade and to reunite the willful immigrant families and the global economy.
Avoiding the subject is merely a luxury for viewers.
However, a six-hour talk show about Bob Woodward’s “genuine background study” for his book Fear and Paul Manafort’s 13 225.73€ ostrich leather Bomber jacket (Washington Post said it was a “too confident clothing”) and Stormy Daniels’ reasons for describing Mr. Trump’s anatomy as a buttery one; the viewer is more than an educated citizen.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario again with the same feeling.
“One of his activities, which may seem to be a reality series, is that he shares something every night,” said Wheelhouse Entertainment CEO and founder of the “Pants” series Brent Montgomery Trump’s show with changing actors and day plan punts (conversation with NFL, praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a section or else you're behind the time.
When he met Fleiss this week, his home was 80 degrees north of Kauai, but he had crawled into the room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stop watching Brett Kavanaugh deal with the Senate Legal Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
"I remember how we used to do all sorts of crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Elsewhere, cash flows move to the fiercest White House mid-term sample
It is not surprising that Division 17 of Pennsylvania will receive a cash flow thanks to the reform of the congressional area, with two incumbents on the same spot.
Thanks to this, the first number of the district of Pittsburg from the Democratic Republic, Conor Lamb, who won a seat in the second district in the extraordinary elections last spring, was again elected.
The opposite candidate for the lamp is Keith Rothfus, a Republican who is currently representing the previous Pennsylvania 12th division, which in most cases overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were changed after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, so the old districts were divided into unconstitutional electoral areas, favouring Republicans.
The new 17th election has opened up a campaign where the financial departments of the largest political parties - the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Campaign Committee of the Republicans (NRCC) - are trumping themselves with money.
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a few victories much viewed in March in the 18th Congressional district of Pennsylvania in extraordinary elections.
This place has been happening for several decades, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political polls have given the democrats a small advantage.
El Salvador, USA, was punished for supporting China, then retreated.
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognised Beijing, a small setback for Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump met with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in a friendly atmosphere and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team of Trump's company.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall the American leaders of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, since Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the Ministry, said earlier this month that these countries had recently stopped supporting Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was to be punished, which received 140 million dollars in aid from America in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and economic impetus.
The proposed sanctions, which included a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to organise a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a development in their efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in the middle of September, the high officials explained that they wanted to continue with the consultation and to stop discussing any punishments against El Salvador.
According to the diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now be judged, who will speak at a meeting in mid-October to discuss the positions of the government.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions on the request for anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by a close analyst to the government who also spoke at the request of anonymity.
Study history
Next thing you know, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on Trump's possible justice, which has a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating in his study whether Trump's campaign is linked to Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would have to report to this institution as if he were going to speak again to voters and perhaps even to his peers judges.
There are many buts here, and I do not want to point out that it is inevitable to bring Trump or his European counterparts to justice.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West had stopped him and supported Czechoslovakia in Münich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-annual carnage.
History revolves around such inflection points, and the ruthless march of democracy draws closer or is delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What are we gonna do if Trump unleashes Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that he proposed the president's secret recording last year and speculated that his position was inappropriate.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
"How do you react if the newly requested investigation by the FBI of Brett Kavanaugh is neither complete nor fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, do we vote for Congress in the middle election if Trump should be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter vacation.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our ambassador's home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me the light of the Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how am I not supposed to be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the Rapid Vienna battle.
The Rangers will organise Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over Australia, which was followed earlier this month by an impressive tie received earlier in Spain against Villarreal, will place them in a strong position to become a Group G of the European League.
The knee injury did not allow the middle player Graham Dorrans to make the first appearance of the season before the 2nd draw game against Villarreal, but believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better results.
“This was a good point for us, because Villarrea has a strong opponent," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went into the game, believing that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was generally a fair result.
They were better at the first half of the game, and we were better at the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good score in their last game, but since the people support us, I'm sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was hard, because of it, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all feel good.
The team is good and the boys are really enjoying it; training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide researchers said that they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they do not talk about it,” explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
However, that should be the starting point.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if they do not know your wishes in advance.
Cooperate with your counselor and family by discussing where and how you can get care, as these options can be extremely important in terms of costs.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan to pay for these costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy of monetary value to help cover these costs, or a financial self-insurance policy - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already in the bud.
Get yourself a health service proxy to identify a trustee to monitor your medical care and ensure that specialists follow your request at a time when you are unable to communicate yourself.
Also consider the trustee in connection with your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write these things down so you'll be ready if you need them.
“It is not only the financial side, but also the one who is the doctors?” Martin explained.
“What kind of medicines are needed?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Set it all up."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported that the number of deaths is still increasing.
Since the communications have been cut, the rescuers have received no information from the Donggala region north, which is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnite earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some important facts about the island of Sulawesi of Palu and Donggala:
It is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, along a narrow bay, and its population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was unexpectedly struck by an earthquake and tsunami.
The Donggala region is an area extending over 300 km (180 miles) in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the information provided by the Norwegian authorities, the Commission considers that the measure constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities in the province of Central Sulawesi, in particular the coastal area of Donggala.
In the province, nickel mining is also important, which is mainly concentrated on the coast opposite Marrowal, Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996 the tsunami hit the west of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific fire circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, located in northern Sumatra, on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 degree earthquake struck Indonesia’s most populated south of Java Island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The area near Padang, the capital city of West Sumatra, was hit by an earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Sumatra - the island of Mentawai, triggering a tsunami up to 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's region in Aceh, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the deadly earthquake of 2004 and the destruction brought by the tsunami.
There was no tsunami at the time, but more than 100 people died in collapsed buildings.
2018: Larger earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in distress.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in connection with suspicions of domestic violence, interference in the report on domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a female person tried to report alleged crimes to the police, Palin took her phone.
Palin is being held by Mat-Su's investigating authority and held against a 500-dollar unsecured bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared on Saturday in a court of law where he declared that he was “in no way guilty, ” announced the news network.
Palin is faced with three A-grade misdemeanors, which means he can face up to a year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a class B offence punishable by one-day imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, Sarah Palin, her mother, was called by the police.
The case is currently being discussed by the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with a domestic attack, interference with the domestic violence crime report and possession of a weapon, all intoxicated.
His girlfriend said he hit him in the face.
Veterans' groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behaviour to the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
An earthquake in Indonesia was followed by a tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake that struck the island of Sulawes, Indonesia, on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the outskirts of the city centre of Sulawes, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Social media broadcast videos showing the moment of the earthquake.
During the capture of the Tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the beach of the city of Palu.
In NYC, federal prosecutors are requesting a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect.
New York federal prosecutors are requesting the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, and this rare punishment for federal crime has not been carried out since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to attack the West Side Road on Lower East Side, mowing pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
According to the death penalty notification in the southern part of New York City, prosecutors need to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and also caused serious injuries in intent to justify the death penalty.
In both cases, according to judicial documents, this is a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with a 22-point charge involving eight murder charges, including extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised criminal offences, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack assumed “extensive planning and premeditation,” said the prosecutors, describing Saipov’s actions as “a hideous, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibulshipeic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’s family and friends,” says the intention message.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the last death trial in the South District Court of New York City.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but he was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, New York, in a federal case when a couple were executed after a conviction plotted for espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a bona fide usbeck, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
According to the police, he had told the detectives that he was happy with what he did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit an attack on ISIS videos viewed from his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted the flag of ISIS displayed in his hospital room.
He hasn't taken the blame for a 22-point charge.
David Patton, one of Saipov's state counsels said that they were "obviously disappointed" in the procedural decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to pursue the death penalty prolongs the trauma of all those involved, instead of a life sentence, which takes the blame without a chance of being released," Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
According to Mr Tory's Member, Ms Farage should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
During the protest of today's Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army".
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to feel the heat of Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's own MEPs recommended that they lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative member of the House of Commons, said on Mars in Birmingham that the UK would be "out" by now if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
However, Mrs May is facing a problem of reconciliation of her deeply divided lines, as stressed by the Conservatives in favour of remaining, joining their protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on the path of Brexit's supporters, icemakers and EU attacks.
The allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite the counter-attack and that the Eurosceptics and Liberals choose between their package and "loss".
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to give up Chequers' plan.
He recommended that Farage be a partner and be given responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
'With his responsibility, we'd be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough MEP added: “I stand up for Brexit, but we must abandon Chequers’ plan.”
Reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that public opinion has now changed since the 2016 vote: “The belief that the British people have changed their minds and wish to remain is not true.”
Andrea Jenkins, a supporter of Tory Brexit, was also on the march and told the reporters: “I say only one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers's plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave Chequers' plan and start listening."
With a message addressed to May, he added: “Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said that the politicians who were at the meeting must be made to feel "hot" when they plan to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class”, he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "we won't let that happen."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who is on the verge of Brexit’s betrayal, uncomfortable.
“We will mobilize the nation’s national army that gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, the icemakers marched through Birmingham before a two - hour gathering in the center of the city.
A handful of activists waved slogans about Toorid versus Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Liberals ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues that they had encountered in their party's application at the opening of the conference.
“These are people who say that they can set up IT systems and transfer all technology to Canada and more, for smooth border crossings, for cross-border trade without restrictions to Ireland,” he added.
“It is with complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's seriously considering running for president.
According to Elizabeth Warren of the United States, after the election in November, she is seriously considering running for president.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future on Saturday at the Western Massachusetts Town Hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will stand in the following elections against Geoff Diehl, the National Representative of the GOP, who was Vice-Chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that he could be a match for Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters at the town hall after Trump took office.
The guest asked if he was planning on running for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, that is, on the front page."
There's been an arrest at the LSU Sims shooting.
LA Police in Baton Rouge announced on Saturday that the suspect of the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference around 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help with the footage to identify the man in sight.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims got shot in the head and died behind it,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a young man of nearly two metres, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them in their original composition, an average of 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2,9 rebounds per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after team records gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment on, it became clear that Valtter Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team sequence played a major role in the race.
Bottas began well and almost neglected Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two occasions and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the pit stops and left Hamilton's group behind in heavy traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the pit stop later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after being side-by-side when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the interior free to pass after trying to protect it on the third turn with a double motion.
Max Verstappen started the competition from the back of the grid and was seventh in place at the end of the first round for his 21-year birthday.
He then led the race for most of the time, driving towards the finish in his tires and passing Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He finally went to the pit stop on the 44th round, but he couldn't increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Valtter did a good job all week and was a real gentleman letting me pass.
“The team has done an excellent job to have one of the two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday meeting because of an incident that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court's nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking at the West Virginia Assembly, the President did not address the statement given by Ford directly before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate, which showed that people were “sinful, disgusting and lying.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and what is happening at the moment that has taken place in the Senate in a few days is that you see anger and angry, wicked, disgusting and deceitful people," he said.
“ If you look at press releases and leaks, which are said: “Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you leak the document? ” — “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added with the look of the senator.
In July, Ford sent Feinstein a letter about Kavanaugh's charges, and it was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill reported: “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep confidentiality, and I did so according to his request.”
However, his denial was not appropriate for the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: “You know, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it's one of the worst body languages I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of three women's sexual misconduct, the President suggested that the democrats would use these accusations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take the power back without choosing the means.
You see this meanness and disgust. They don’t care who they hurt, who they need to run over to gain power and leadership," said the President of Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
The Giants Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee.
Dundee Stars won the Belfast Giants Reunion of Friday's elite league, who lost to Dundee at 5:3.
The Giants took the lead early with two gates at Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie before Dwyer took the Giants to lead again.
Francois Bouchard equated Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
It was an elite league for Adam Keefe's men for the third loss. They came to Belfast on Friday night to defeat Dundee as at 2:1.
It was the fourth meeting of half the season, of which Giants won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening gate came in at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford, when Beauwillier doubled the head start four minutes later.
Sullivan brought home the home team back to the game at 13:10 in the fast first third before Matt Marquardti helped Cownie hit the tie gate at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were in charge before the first break, pushing the second gate at the end of the first third of their night.
The players in the home square regrouped and Bouchard put them back on the level, beating the numerical weight of the minute at the 27:37 gate.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen for the first time in Dundee's leading position at the end of the second third of the game, securing the final third victory in his team's attack zone.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
The air traffic controller is dying to save hundreds of people from the earthquake.
One Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
The great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawes on Friday caused a tsunami, after which more than 800 people died, many of whom have been missing.
The area is plagued by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped under ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled the fluctuating tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on duty to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321 while on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the tower, thinking it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s spokesperson, Yohannes Sirait, confirmed that his decision could save hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to transport Kalimantan from Balikpapan to another major hospital in the city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We were extremely sad when we heard about this," added the spokesman.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to thousands, and according to the State Disaster Mitigation Agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
A spokesman for the Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said: “The number of deaths may increase, because the bodies of many victims are still under ruins and have not been saved.”
The six-metre waves devastated the city of Palu, where the mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Chire aid makes new sacrifices every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we cannot tell what they might find there.
It is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “I ask you to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this?" CNN said.
The city of Lomboki in Indonesia was struck by an earthquake early this year, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia Air Accident: Air Niugin Airlines claims that one man has disappeared since the lagoon flight crash
Although it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from a sinking plane, the airline, which operated a plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one man has disappeared.
Air Niugini said in his statement that from Saturday afternoon they could not find a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond promptly to the details of the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water on landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy said that the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane ran over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very low when it landed.
"This is very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to climb the sinking plane in the water at the height of their waist to the emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin staff was panicking and screaming and that he suffered a small head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and the sailors who worked on the nearby berth also helped to rescue by using inflatable boats to take people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres.
The aviation safety network data show that 111 persons have died in accidents involving air carriers registered with PNG in the last two decades, but none of them related to Air Niugin.
Analyst prepares schedule for the night she was burned alive
On Saturday, the Prosecutor’s Office concluded a retrial of the case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours analyzing intelligence as an expert observer.
He pointed out to the jury how he used cell phone records to recreate the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted the young man’s earlier claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford walked into the courtroom on Saturday and admitted he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said that he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis “false because my car was in Nashville”.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers before she died for about two weeks.
The phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from her life,” said Hale.
The defense is planning to make a court-martial on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hiphop?
Hippo trio wants to fight a negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hiphop has moved away from the origins of his political messages and his social problems.
They want to go back to hip-hop roots and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently gained popularity in Britain thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?!
The New York nanny is suing a couple of people for a racist message.
The New York nanny sues for discriminatory dismissal after a few of her parents accidentally received a message from her mother complaining that the nanny was "a second black."
A couple deny that they're racists compared to blackmail.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her resentment when she learned that their new lashes provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband saying: “IIIIIIIII, FOLLOW THE MUSTANHALINE.”
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
New York Post claims that the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman, after his clumsy understanding of Miss Maurice, fired her claim that their social nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had waited for a Filipino instead of her.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now suing a couple to get the compensation for dismissal he wants to receive on a daily basis in the amount of $350 for the next six months, and the same job he was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show them that look, so do it,” he said to The Post, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have rejected the claim that they are racists, saying that it was a reasonable thing to stop working with Maurice because they feared that they could no longer trust him after insulting her.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
“We are not racists,” said his wife, Joel Plasco, to The Post.
“But would you give your children to keep a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was involuntary?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of a child and was in a “very difficult situation”.
"Would you go against someone like that?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned a couple in social media, where they are severely judged because of their behaviour and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that the readers would not interact with the talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born right after the book was accepted, said: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of a person who read it for the first time before publication.
It's a lot of fun to know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He said that his father, inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was saddened by the death of his father last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family,” he added that his father was silently proud of his final success.
“He was a rather quiet man and was not a showy person," he said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like a feeling that your child achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not directly your achievement.
I believe he observed Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When he arrived, his daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked in vain to save his life.
“They regularly called to say that her daughter’s condition was very bad and that they did not believe she would survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
“ Then I received a call from Nad, who said that my daughter would die within two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep beating his heart were slowly disappearing and leaving his system.
He was dead a short time before that, and now all the systems have stopped working.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't howl, I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who now mourned her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who knew nothing of her experiences.
“No one knew that,” he said.
“I kept my head on the ground, and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outburst of sympathy for Nadi on that flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Mourning woman's postcards prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have glued maps on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when she suffered from depression, and 18 when she killed herself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile would make the whole room shine."
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died because he was in a very bad place with his own people.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it has a domino effect.”
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even to her friend.
Don't shut up – you have to talk."
Miss Humphreys, who has been friends with Miss Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after her husband's mother died.
“He didn’t say that he felt bad or depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behaviour a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
Ms. Humphreys said that the man’s death was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to cope with it: “It tears the wound into the whole family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to keep going and keep fighting."
If you have difficulty coping, you can call Samaritans free of charge at 116 123 (United Kingdom and Ireland), contact by e-mail jo@samaritans.org or go to the Samaritan website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future is hanging by a thread while the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I believed that if we actually got something that he wanted – a study of limited time and scope – we could possibly achieve unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would "fall together" in the middle of a permanent guerrilla stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their reluctance was due to timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks from now, on November 6th, if the Republicans do not succeed as expected, they will be greatly weakened in their intentions to get the man they want to lead to the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and who he met with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to cast a decisive vote and confirm Mr Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deserters "decreasing" under Kim's rule
South Korean legislation has said that the number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sugu, quoting the data from the South Korean Ministry of Harmonisation, said that compared to the 2011 deserters (2706), their number has decreased last year (1127).
Mr Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China, and a greater number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Army deserters have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to the magazine Seoul, there are more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War to cross the border illegally in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarised area between the two Koreas.
China takes deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their homeland by force.
North and South Korea's relations, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably over the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the elimination of stagnant nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they promised to work broadly towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of sanctions due to a lack of progress.
“Untrusted by the United States, our country lacks security security, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mr. Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was unfit for Supreme Court justice.
The opposition leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said that the man was temperamentally unfit to serve as Supreme Court Judge.
Pelosi gave an opinion on Saturday’s interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but notice that if a woman had performed in this way, she would have been called hysterical,” said Pelos about his reaction to the testimony given on Thursday before the Senate Legal Committee in Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in her opening remarks, almost screaming from time to time, describing her family and her years in high school, and she was sometimes speechless.
He also expressly condemned the members of the Democratic Party who had been in the Committee by calling the accusations against him against the loss of Hillary Clinton's presidential election in 2016 as a “grotesx and coordinated murder of reputation” organised by angry liberals.
According to Pelos, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man was not a judge of the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself by saying these things and the way he attacked the Clintons and democrats,” he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if he would try to dismiss Kavanaugh if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives if he had been approved.
“I say as much – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only a judge of the Supreme Court, but he’s not fit in the court where he works now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a court judge at Columbia District Appeal Court.
Pelos added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible decisions against Kavanaugh's Affordable Care Act (Health Act – a translator's comment) or Roe v. Wade (Abort's legitimate precedent – a translator's remark) because a man is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation session, Kavanaugh avoided asking whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical biased person to become a judge and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t it great?’ said Pelosi.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair blasphemy, an overflowing hatred for months and years, and he can't get away with it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued: “I received help from a woman who was somewhere in charge; she said that she cried too when she got angry, but she developed a method that was that, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, “You might think I am crying because I am sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was genius."
Tears are partially accepted as an expression of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is of an early job in an office with a majority of men, where I found myself crying once in an indescribable rage when an older woman — a strict leader whom I had always feared — grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," he said to me.
“They don’t know you’re furious.
They think you're sad, and it'll give them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, then Congressman of the Democratic Party from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a yacht called Monkey Business with an extramarital affair and the campaign ended, Schroeder, deeply upset, thought that there was no reason why he should not think about running for president himself.
“It was not a well thought-out decision,” he said to me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was to join someone else.”
Someone said it's like "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was coming to an end, he was late in the fundraising process, and he promised not to run unless he had a total of two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who donated $1,000 to men gave him only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he thought.
When he gave a talk where he announced that he would not launch an official campaign, his feelings — gratitude for the people who supported him — became so overwhelmed by the system that made it difficult to raise money and turn to voters instead of delegates, and his hatred for sexism became so overwhelmed by his tears.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press to him.
‘I should have thought Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they're writing on my tombstone.
"He cried?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Help Beijing
The opening bangs of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, experts say that a long-term gap between countries can be beneficial for Beijing.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, gave the first warning shot this year by imposing taxes on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), essentially imposing taxes on half of Chinese imports to the US.
Beijing has reciprocated every time, last time it was five to ten percent at a rate of 60 billion dollars worth of American goods.
China has promised the US a shot-by-shot, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to blink soon.
Getting Washington back would be a concession to demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing’s cards are right, a trade war with the US could support China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause the economic loss of control in another country is actually far more dangerous than the bystanders have previously admitted,” said Research Fellow Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asian research at the Center for New American Security.
According to the foreign minister, Syria is ready for the return of refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
“The situation in the country’s territory is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore the destroyed areas of terrorists to return to normal.
There are now all the conditions for refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and because of their daily lives and their livelihoods, to be able to return voluntarily.
According to the UN forecast, 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid for the reconstruction of a devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the state would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final result of 16,5 vs. 10.5 at the Le Golf National Golf Course near Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Dane Captain Thomas Bjorn's team received the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who was in the middle of the entire tournament, hit 16 water on track par 3, surrendering victory to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who achieved 5:0:0 in the current starting format of the tournament in 1979.
For the American Jordan Spieth, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest ranking of the European team, scored 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, outnumbered the Englishman Ian Poulter with 2 and 1 to whom the Ryder Cup might have been the last.
Eight veterans of the Ryder Cup, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European in the 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the cup back.
It's a team spirit and I'm glad I could be of help," said Emotional Garcia because of Europe's victory.
He passes the torch on to his fellow countryman Jon Rahm, who won U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
“I feel extraordinary pride that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four fights in France, and now he has a career in the Ryder Cup 13 :21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who've won 14 titles in the championships, leaving only Jack Nicklaus behind.
The U.S. team was in a hurry to find fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
After the team’s disappointing performance, U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of the guys, they were courageous.
There were many moments in the morning when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought them.
Hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a great job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We'll have to lift the hat.
They played better than us."
New information on water blooms: decreased concentration in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general decrease in the concentration of flowering algae in the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the FWC, there have been reports of more patchy blooms in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating decreasing concentrations.
The amount of water blooms is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
The spots can be found 10 miles (16 km) off the Hillsborough County coast, but places have been reduced since last week.
Water blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there have been reports of average concentrations on the coast or offshore in Pinellas County, low to high concentrations on the high seas in Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations on the coast and on the high seas in Sarasota County, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations on the coast and on the high seas in Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
The counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier continue to report respiratory irritation.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida within the past week.
