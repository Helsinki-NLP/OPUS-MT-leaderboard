Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, police in Spain detained the so-called Kemerovo group leader Slava Gulevitch, who is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
It is suspected that they are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organisation between the ages of 27 and 57, who are mainly involved in drug offences.
In Mijas, Malaga, Spain, the alleged leader of a criminal organisation was detained.
In Estonia, three men were detained as suspects, one of them is reported to be the leading figure of a criminal organisation, and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected indicates that the role and role of the criminal organisation had been clearly allocated.
The aim of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thereby to earn proceeds", commented the Head of Pre-trial Proceedings in the criminal case, State Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this case", the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously come to the attention of law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed the importance of cooperation with Spanish colleagues throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of this cooperation", commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation of nearly a year and a half.
"The long-term work in the first half of the week came to fruition and at the same time we suspected crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that the officers of the Central Criminal Police were helping with detention in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that, while at liberty, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor’s office requested and approved their arrest.
A man arrested in Spain awaits his surrender to Estonia.
In this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial criminal proceedings are conducted by the Office for Organised Crimes of the Central Criminal Police and run by the State Prosecutor’s Office.
Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion in 2005 and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, after Nikolai Tarankov, then underworld leader, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world.
Gulevitch from Kemerovo emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
Supposedly, he taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and charged monthly roofing taxes to businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds from crime and judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the so-called eight accused persons separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev criminal organisation, who seized 80 000 euros of proceeds from crime, or the judgment against nine persons, that Igor Aleynikov established a criminal association in 2006 aimed at illicit trafficking of smuggled cigarettes and committing crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Ida-Virumaa and South Estonia.
Confiscated proceeds of crime amount to nearly 71 500 euros.
In these cases, success has been ensured by the daily exchange of information with foreign colleagues and evidence by prosecutors and, if necessary, by acting together in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri about state discriminatory politics and racist attacks.
The Group's statement states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and Missouri to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious as they move around the state, given the suspicious race-based events that have recently taken place across the state and are brought out here."
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning, both by the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win cases involving discrimination, and by the fact that the State's law enforcement targets are unequally large in size, particularly for minorities.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They pull to the side of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said President Rod Chapel of the NAACP Missouri branch to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never received complaints this densely before."
This is the first warning the organization has issued about the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults to black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances at the beginning of this year after he ran out of gas driving through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the remark refers to a recent report by the Prosecutor General of Missouri, which shows that in the state, black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
"The note is intended to make people aware and warn their families, friends and workmates about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared, whether it means bringing bail money or informing their relatives that they are passing through the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state in 16th place in a cross-section of the state in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also the answer to the new Missouri Act, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Association (American Civil Liberties Union ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws requiring local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, as according to ACLU this increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What can anyone know about the various forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which can progress to cirrhosis of the liver, or crease of the liver, and liver cancer, are at a disadvantage.
Health Board Epidemiology Advisor Kutsar says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease is also the popular name of inflammation of the liver called jaundice.
In children, hepatitis may progress without signs or symptoms.
Different types of inflammation of the liver can only be identified on the basis of laboratory test data.
Acute hepatitis may become chronic hepatitis and progress for decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous liver disease.
Kutsar of the moon outlines various forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from infected person’s stools to hands and hands on food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth, and using drugs.
The group at risk of hepatitis A infection includes family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with an infected person, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Vaccinations can prevent infection, in particular for people travelling many times and at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene: washing or disinfecting hands, washing all fruit and vegetables before food consumption is essential.
Hepatitis B viruses spread through contact with the blood of a patient, drug injection, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated household objects (dental brushes, shavings), donor blood, sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a foetus/neonatal.
Injecting drug users, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other body fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease are at risk of hepatitis B infection.
In particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted disease and diabetes, in order to prevent hepatitis B.
Other preventive measures against hepatitis B include: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms in cases of potentially infectious sex or prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B in Estonia is part of the national immunisation programme and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread through contact with the blood of a patient, drug injection, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated household items, blood from a donor to a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to a foetus/neonatal.
Injecting drug users, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other body fluids, HIV infected persons and travellers visiting countries with a high infection of hepatitis C are at risk of hepatitis C infection.
Prevention measures for hepatitis C include: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms in cases of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection with hepatitis B or superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B is present.
Hepatitis D viruses spread through contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringes and needles, sexually and rarely from the infected mother to the foetus.
The risk groups for hepatitis D are chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus and people not immune to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is the vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses spread fecal-oral via drinking water and food, including low-temperature beef, fish and clams, donor blood, shared syringes and infected mother to foetuses.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high levels of illness.
Prevention measures for hepatitis E include hygiene: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the patient.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating undercooked beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Although on the last round, competitors tried to push four times the Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end of the line and won with 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, drawing his wife, Tania, and his children, along with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the trail with them was wonderful," Farah told journalists.
Farah is aiming at 5,000 and 10,000 meters of gold doubles in London in a row for the fifth prize.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait, an extraordinary story" goes much deeper than the birth story of one piece of art into the cultural life of Vienna at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.
But even more deeply into history.
The awe - inspiring amount of information could have been useful, or a louder cut axe, and the narrower theme would have allowed more access to the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title.
It is as if there were two books between the same covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted on Gustav Klimt and her painting "Daam in Gold", and a much more extensive and comprehensive history book about the respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the bubbling cultural life of Vienna, and who himself has come to the capital of Austria, can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life was around Ringstrasse or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the name you know in the book, you feel a little more cultured.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where there was a proliferation of incurable syphilis and the highest level of suicides in Europe, does not seem to add to the development of the story.
Or perhaps any paired brush stroke adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had increased exponentially, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
During the turn of the century, nearly one in ten inhabitants of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele’s parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married twice to open up the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt’s famous paintings, her father’s bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele was not drawn to the glamorous life she belonged to.
When you look at Lady in Gold, it's hard to believe that in the end of life this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife's portrait from Klimt, the hottest painter in Vienna was the last moment.
Klimt’s order at the time cost 4000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a land house with a good location.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of the master's love affair with a model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certainty is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that developed during the work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Daam in gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the start of his work with Adele, Klimt had visited Ravenna in the San Vitale basilica, and researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics of Empress Theodora that were seen there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his Lady in Gold in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (between 1907 and 1908) another golden painting, Kiss, was born.
Art historians did not miss the similarity of two women.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
"In memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him a debt to make his handiwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished their family Klimt's collection to go to the museum.
Six years before Klimt died, there was another portrait of Adele.
In his will (Adele left in February 1925) he also asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four landscape paintings of Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
Her jewelry was passed on to her nieces, Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt graduated from "Austrian Mona Lisa", 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get into Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed to draw.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the reason for not being accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria's will, had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find works that were pleasing to the Nazi party from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Hitler’s personal art store also suited some of Adele’s homework, but not Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year litigation started between the Austrian Government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauer.
It is only to be noted that when the Kisses are seen in the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Dam's Gold" must be seen in New York's Neue Galerie.
And before you go to Vienna, read the book above.
Even if you don't plan to go to Klimt's work, at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish themes after the book was closed than the 135 million-dollar painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait as a family fate story - and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree, mentioned at the beginning of the book, clearly facilitated the orientation of events.
A 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the flood, Gold was very close to his own 200-metre private record of back swimming 2.16.62.
The top stamp dates back a week ago on a 17-year-old girl, when the Canadian Junior Championship was 2.16.58, mediated by Priit Aaviku Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last one to get to the A-Final, maybe the tenth.
In the final, he passed the distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a powerful new top stamp.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15.13) left Gold with just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time rankings, Gold became third and his new personal top stamp is the fifth result of all-time Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still taking off at the Canadian Adult Championships at 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in free swimming and 200 m and 400 m in complex swimming.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championship took place in Toronto, and Gold also made successful launchs there.
He won a 200-foot free-floating silver medal in 2.03.22.
So fast, this distance was floated by an Estonian woman last year in 2008.
Only Elina Partyka, the Estonian record woman, has swam this distance faster than Gold in Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada also won a bronze medal in 100 m free-floating with an excellent personal record and the top stamp of the new Estonian season 56.66.
For example, a year older than him, Kertu Ly Alnek, has swam this distance only one century faster.
He reached the top of his personal stamp when he got 100 meters on his back while he got a note in the opening of the flood at 1.03.69.
At half the distance, he won the seventh place when he swam in the finals 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading the rankings of the Estonian season in four different distances.
President Trump is going on vacation, critics are sharpening their teeth.
It's vacation time, which means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
Since Trump has so far been one of the presidents who took out the most vacation days, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to today and CNN in the United States, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at a golf club named Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's holiday started yesterday, Trump's opponents have been speaking about the holiday for a week.
They reproach Trump too often for rest.
It is the President’s custom to spend weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196th day of office.
For example, George W. Bush had already been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama had half as much as Trump, only 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things quickly.
The days after he became president, Trump said on "60 minutes" that there would be no time for long vacations during his term of office, as much needs to be done.
He also expressed his disapproval of Barack Obama's vacation three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, plays golf, goes to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS chops off the heads of journalists."
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not exactly a relaxation.
Rather, it is officially referred to as work leave, during which Trump does not have time for reading or other pleasure activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working leave.
In fact, in the west wing of the White House, the air conditioning system is being replaced and therefore all personnel had to leave.
The Oval Office and other office rooms of the President are also located in the West Wing.
"I don't think any of you would like to be in the west wing in August if it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, spokesman at the White House, who stressed that the president would continue to work on vacation.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the state office if you do not tolerate the criticisms of voters
Our country's father knew a lot about the unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take the newspapers long to kick his ass for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, criticism upset him.
But he didn't force his critics to keep quiet.
Because in 1783 Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken away from us, and in silence and muteness we may be led to massacres like sheep".
It brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And by the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued him.
The governor's office branded the case void, and the web comments were full of counter-reactions in the style of "Who cares?"
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But it does matter.
And it matters especially when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It's an amazingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His acceptance rate is second best among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a thoughtless reacting hothead.
He has led the state with a firm hand and has remained firmly committed to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook rather skillfully as the main tool for communicating with his voters, presenting his bald head, for example, for the first time after chemotherapy.
Thus, the Governor's page, which is a public forum with official markings, which is managed by blocking the people who visit the taxpayer's dollars-paid staff, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the behaviour of the governor, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderating.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of online railings, spam mailers, or angry people.
The Post spoke to several real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are real people who communicate with their elected leaders, a teacher, a company owner and a pastor, not online trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not obscene.
In his post, the pastor quoted the Bible, emphasising the Catholicism of Hogan.
A lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, didn't incite Sharma Raman, but in real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed because he had not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in the commentary country on The Post's news story.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort rather than admitting that it is a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor's official called "guided spam attack", others would probably call "public support".
The Facebook age allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when workers had to be expelled to do the same so that they would collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest protestors and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for teething Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been suing Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter feed.
One of the first symbolic judgments on this subject was given last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the chairman of the Loudoun County Supervisory Board violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, affordable postal charges had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled and anonymous writers smote his leadership.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Yuricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents collected in the context of the web-based George Washington mail collection project, his office was buried in petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain.
But he didn't force them to keep quiet.
Freedom of speech, differences of opinion and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for homeland comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European top number Ronan Rafferty hopes for homeland comfort in the next three days when the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses will take place on 25th Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who was leading the last round of the archerfield Links trails in the neighbourhood last year before his downfall to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and performs the role of ambassador to the tournament instead of founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we can see how the club shines in full glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"Gamers see the path in its best form, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He's a keen supporter of the golf game, and he's proud of what he's done.
It allows the trail to be presented perfectly."
The Englishman Eales looks forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This is accompanied by a very special feeling," said the player who resides in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my title as Extremadura Open because it was taken out of my competition calendar a year later.
It's magical to come back to this area.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts."
Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour in the early part of the year when he was 50, will return to the competition again on the ground.
This is his first event in Scotland after participation in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"To play at home is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but at the same time you also feel the extra tension.
I've enjoyed playing again a lot, and I've shown you a pretty decent golf game.
I'm happy with what's going on so far."
The Trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain Sam Torrance of the Ryder Cup are two of the six Scots in the race, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, and parking a car with one passenger costs a car with 5 pounds and a car with two or more passengers with 10 pounds.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s Goldy Land
If Bardina's cooking Dege's dinner, she won't use the stove.
He even rarely uses a pot.
In a wooden cabin in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai Regent of Papua Province, Indonesia, the housewife places a sweet potato called nota in the local language directly on the scene of fire.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the fire and eaten eagerly with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor with no furniture, and there he also does his daily chores, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from a nearby sex.
The toilet role is carried out by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since she is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she is not assigned to care for any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work, however, can be dangerous for most of the men in the village, and many of them drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to visit after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse into the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was merged under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that led to controversy, forcing only 1026 elderly people to vote before the eyes of the occupier forces.
The movement, which incited the Netherlands from domination, quickly turned its rage against the Jakarta government, which still holds the region under strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Paapua and Western Paapua, so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a remote and abandoned place alike. To get here, you have to fly 90 minutes from Jayapura, the capital of the province, to Nabire, and then take a five-hour journey that makes you nauseous with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has turned various shades into yellowish brown.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, not to mention journalists, nor have there been almost any foreigners here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago’s paaps worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before we wore only leaves of plants on our body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also a gold-rich country in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153 000 inhabitants in New Jersey, is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted some USD 3.1 billion of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can be proud of wood in the wood industry, which is estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of the suffering of the poppies, for they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study of The New York Times showed that Freeport paid approximately USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 to one officer.
The attempts of the poppies to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 paapua have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, in the highlands belonging to the Papuan tribes, the mass killing in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, over 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 report of the archbishop of Birsbane, "We lose everything", contains testimony to the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (a second report says that rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful protests.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, because such incidents take place every week," says Andreas Harso, researcher at Human Rights Watch, Indonesia.
The screws are even tighter closed because the natural resources of Papua have caused the influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demography is changing, as Muslim economic migrants are arriving from Indonesia's crowded islands of Java, Kalimantani, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javan family canteens sell a gado gado with crisp chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market less expensive than local paapua," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province for work.
"The paapua mama-mamas [women] are therefore losing their market share."
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, who is known among the people as Jokowi, promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Paapua in his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter won 27 out of the 29 electoral districts of Papua, including Paniai, on his way to the Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But Paapua has changed very little, and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation that he would fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai suffered from a decline.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs at the fire in Enarotalis when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle out of darkness.
Frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to Yavedt Tebai, the local pastor, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, drunk soldiers chased children and beat them with their rifle handles.
Then one of the soldiers fired on the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young men, women, and children from Papua met to claim justice at the local police station and the football field in front of the military command center.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance of the Paapua honey pago tribe, in which they ran around and emulated the bird song.
Some protestors started throwing rocks at the police and the military.
"If the mob resists more than three times, shoot them," said the official document of the journal TIME, but not published on local media publications.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the senior district of Kego Koto, the city of Enarotal, felt the threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he said to the magazine TIME on the porch of his brightly colored tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from a bunch of soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of shots," he adds.
A local man named Alfius Youw was hit three times by a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I came to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said TIME magazine, darkly Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... kissing him."
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of the Papuan police told the reporters that he was only responsible for the security of his department because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened to be killed," said Commissar Pudjo Sulistiya, a spokesman for the Papuan police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings didn't get to Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and promised to deal with abuse in Paapua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Wiranto, said that he would set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the crimes against human rights that have taken place.
But almost immediately, apologies followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
On 5 June, speaking with TIME in Jakarta, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints in Paapua.
Instead, he said that "all things will be settled by law".
Wiranto, accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Paapua, including in Pania.
The families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim distrust.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view that the people of Paniai were afraid to dissect this incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the Paniai neighbourhood in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when they went into a conversation between the villagers and the manager of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s office on the construction site.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the police, and the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to the locals, the mobile brigade (military police in Indonesia) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we were afraid of revenge," said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the incarceration of the injured.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and for a mobile police brigade to withdraw from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the discontent of the honey, mon, dan, and Damal tribes in Papua’s greening central mountainland.
Many of them have joined the Free Papuan Movement (VPL) in the rebel army, which, according to him, defends the rights of the Paapua by occasional attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "defence of state sovereignty", the military has arrested Paniis over the last few years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as the "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
Few rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is just as unattainable.
People grow all their food mainly in sweet potatoes, along with some fruit and vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crops for the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In the course of time, economic disparities between the indigenous Paapua and the new migrants who have arrived since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport have deepened.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Paapua itself often lacks the capital or skills needed to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribe Council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Paapua.
In addition, there are tough restrictions on foreign media.
In the beginning of this year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow the relevant practices", although they had been given a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asia Department of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s election promises have not been implemented to remove restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report from the most turbulent provinces of Papua to the east and Western Papua are threatening new threats to reject visas and blacklisting," he said in his statement.
The lack of a hard-on view of the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to close neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states in Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands urged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the "multiple crimes" in Paapua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically also supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dismissed the accusations of the group, saying to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still democratic order and freedom of the press, so that the evidence of human rights cases would be difficult to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to notice.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands, headed by the national human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people interrupted their silence, according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous, asking: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the paapua do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a well-meaning man, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants to make it clear to Jokow that not only do the people of Pania continue to live under the threat of a predatory army, but they suffer from misery because of poor educational and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like other paaps, view their voice to Jokow as a debt that he will have to repay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooters managed to cope with the last symbolic rebellion they buried the body of one of the victims in a police station and in a land opposite the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swallowed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time.
The fire swooped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee this 337-metre-high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has ravaged a high building that happens to be called the Torch, or Torch Tower, for just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct causes of fire were reported.
"We slept and woke up to a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident to Reuters, who called himself George.
According to Dubai’s civil defence officers, firefighters extinguished the flame about 4 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of the investigation carried out by the Torch Board following the fire in 2015, it was found that decorative panels and insulation of facades, exterior surfaces, suffered the most damage.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation and façade panels of Grenfell Tower in London could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed some 80 people.
Look, these phones are probably gonna be a hit in the fall.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came for sale in spring, and new hit phones are also expected in autumn.
According to TV2’s marketing and sales director Kristjan Seema, this year’s flagships are characterized by innovative design, eye iris scanner, edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and ultra-fast processor.
Samsung Galaxy S8 created great excitement in the world of technology, which has also reached the top of the Estonian Smartphone Sales Ranking.
Autumn allows even more rapid charging, more durable battery, better quality camera and greater water and dust resistance for those interested in crying.
He added that on the basis of the rumors, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict the four top models that are likely to take over this year's sales charts.
These four top models of smartphones will still reach the supermarkets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the supermarkets as early as mid-September.
Rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what you can do with it spreads a lot.
While iPhone 7 did not lead to significant differences between iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday expects the new model to be completely different from the previous ones.
Four colours have been mentioned: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple's design manager JonyIve insists that the new iPhone model looks like smooth glass.
The ceramic version of the iPhone has also been mentioned.
In addition to the eye iris scanner, wireless charging and an even higher quality camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
I'm sure it's one of the most anticipated smart phones of the year.
The pre-ordering of the brand-new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23rd.
There's been a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
From what I hear, more is meant for a business user and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrower view of the TV lens.
At present, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable in quality to iPhone 8.
But we're looking forward to August 23rd.
Although this year Nokia has sold three smartphones led by Nokia 6, there is still a lack of their flagship, Nokia 8, which will be presented already on 16 August.
We expect from Nokia a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge screen and a high-speed Qalcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia’s new model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by Zeiss.
If Sony’s specific flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony's new model has been speculated to have a screen of at least six inches.
What reality brings, we will see very soon, because traditionally Sony has released its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to the leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pushed Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post published transcripts of phone calls between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the Heads of State of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump made a telephone call to the Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to stop public witnessing that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of America scolded the wall with him for public condemnation, saying, "You can't tell the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that he would make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts of his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, were also published, revealing an intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees going to Australia was "a ridiculous", "bummer" and "bummer". He claimed that the agreement made during Obama's government would give him the impression of "dangerous" because he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump hung up by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not consider the complaint by OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the purchase of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an order rejecting the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid for the purchase of Tartu bus, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is the procurement of public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court the judgment of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not take the matter into consideration.
Although in social media many complain that Weekend’s noise from the festival disturbs their night’s sleep and the whole town is full of drunk partyers, there are also many who have no bad words about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the people at the store were so polite!
I didn't see any blurry or rudeness.
Even I saw kindness," says the wreath of Laine.
"It is nice to have people come, be and enjoy Pärnu, which has wintered like a hibernation," he adds joyfully.
The blizzard from the beach doesn't bother Laine's sleep.
When he lived downtown, he still heard that music was played on the beach, now the music has not reached his home intensifies.
"But I hope I do," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also discussed the evening newspaper, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu – it will make a significant contribution to the turnover of local merchants.
He also rejoices that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
You don't bother the party lady.
Although I'm not sunbathing on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach's alive.
And I'm glad people are moving and it's been like this three times already," says the woman.
I think it was a little worse the first time.
"There may have been complaints," he meditates.
However, according to him, playing on the beach is common for the summer capitals.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, who is farting in the park.
Melu and commotion have not shattered his rhythm of life either.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interethnic communication would be better.
A loud music doesn't crush a man.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can save and have no trouble," he says.
According to him, the guests who came to Pärnu are polite.
"They've exaggerated a little with bottles, of course, but young people are young, and for God's sake, let's go, but be people and we'll get through it!" he says.
By then, the beachers have traveled away to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life – people like to play this way", says Tiina, who has walked with children in Pärnu.
His family’s sleep does not bother the music of the festival either, although last year it sounded even further than this year.
Last summer was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live out of town, that it actually sounds pretty good down there by the Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to reinvigorate business.
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it will cut 3,000 more jobs and reduce its interim dividends by 72 percent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to resolve the business’s threatening distress.
The jobs that will be lost, according to CEO John Fallon, will most likely be made redundant at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by a further GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) under the third cost reduction programme in order to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell the stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that their expectation of the year has not changed since the announcement of a 1 % increase in sales revenue to GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: a NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
According to the officials, the suicide bomber attacked military convoys in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and hurting several of you.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the Qarabagh district of the city.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul near the Iraqi embassy.
NATO statement said that a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "self-made explosive carried by a man".
According to the statement, everyone is in a stable state and is being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the growing force of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) is a serious source of concern for NATO forces in Bagram, Qarabagh.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shiid district in Kabul.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a large bomb attack killed more than 150 people in the city centre - this has led to the most deaths by a military attack in the country since the US-led troops repelled the Taliban in 2001.
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's military and police forces.
Correspondents claim that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the smog order following actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama-era Regulation, which obliges states to limit smog-causing exhaust gases, one day after 15 states took the Agency to court because of this move.
The EPA announced its decision to proceed with the "2015 Ozone Determining Operations" late on Wednesday, saying that it demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with States.
"We believe that we must engage in dialogue and listen to our state partners," said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in his statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced EPA’s intention to postpone the determinations of ozone levels for the measurement of smog pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year until October 2018 in order to meet a more stringent air quality standard.
On Tuesday, 15 countries, mainly democratic states, brought an action together with the Columbian district, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost economic growth.
But these efforts have provoked a reaction among the democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of ozone-containing air "may reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of respiratory disease", such as asthma.
German pigs could have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a feast, as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, says Bloomberg.
This year, it may be that weeks of showers before harvesting can mean that the bread grain is only suitable for feeding to animals.
"The quality of the wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said the analyst of Agravis Raiffeisen, Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can be turned into animal feed, double compared to normal, forecasted by Agrivis.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First of all, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heat wave.
In July, Germany was hit by rainstorms, which continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area hasn't even started harvesting yet, reported a local harvest collector in Ceravi.
"It's quite a difficult day," said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, Ceravis Senior Trader.
Coherence in everything, or clever Finnish interior design kinky
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fair houses, because through the large windows the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
At every step, our northern neighbours stand out in their efforts to create both crisp and perfect (energy-efficient) homes.
It is worth admiring and also following that Finns use wood as building and finishing materials, in the manufacture of furniture and beauty articles.
Stimulating techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fairhouses both by the builder and the (home) designer.
There it is evident that black, white, and grey shadings, when supplemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked for another week because the fair lasts until August 13th.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
This year's Weekend Festival to Baltic was pulled down on the night against today, and Martin Garrix did everything he could on the main stage to remember as the last performer.
The crowd was really turned around during Garrix's performance - singing, hollering, dancing, self-esteeming.
When Garrix finished, the combined mass was scattered from Pärnu beach to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures our photographer caught on Weekend in three days.
I'm sure you're one of them, too. Find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face the most attractive boxing match in the near future in a weight category of up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN's office in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, walked across the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's Badweight Champion.
After the victory of Garcia's unanimous decision over the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are in the top five of the scales.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko will protect his belt with Miguel Marria on Saturday night at ESPN.
When a couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between fighters would be a "perfect measure".
"I'm former feathered-weight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up for Broner [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to go below the weight of lightweight.
And he's going to have to move up the weight of light [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
It's what the fans have wanted.
Let's offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be subject to a fee. It is part of his strategy to have Lomachenko debut 61.2 kg in class later this year in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in fighting Jorge Lineares and Luke Campbell's match winner at the Forum of their Lightweight Round on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be subject to a charge, because the fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, saying later that she is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We're the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia says she thinks Lomachko's a "mighty fighter" and can go see her Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that he thought the three division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this knockout".
Garcia said the goal was to show the strength of the blow and then fight.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension growing for prosperity between them.
"This is a fight that awaits realization.
No other confrontation will cause so much attention and buzz.
I am more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
It'll be a good fight."
Which corners of the world will they move to Estonia from?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, last year, when it was decided to grant a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, the number was 4928.
The authorities do not know how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared at the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year, but in recent years this figure is getting close to 2,000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most – 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than they left last year.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that opportunities for work and learning are being sought in a country where the community and many families are already ahead," stated Kristin Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the total number of fixed-term residence permits granted to the latter has been 10 years.
If Ukrainians come to work here mostly, then Russian citizens for family migration.
"Considering the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, the migration researcher of the Academy of Internal Defence.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received Estonian residence permits have moved to live, then Harju County is immediately after Ida-Virumaa", he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased.
"Hype is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for for for permanent entry into Estonia," explained Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the residence permit has been rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanent admission to Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to promote the survival of adapted people.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased due to the new residence permit.
Last year, for example, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now the Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer follow with the finger whether the wage criterion has been fulfilled.
This residence permit became popular – applicants last year were holders of a grey passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese, were granted a residence permit to settle in Estonia.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
In 2007, when three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, 200 last year.
They come from Nigeria to study at the universities here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to learning mobility.
In their case, too, the rule is that where the community has emerged, there will be more people there," Rammus added.
In the course of ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit each year, it is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if we add European Union citizens, migration will remain at about a percentage", Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to Statistics Estonia, 14 822 people travelled to Estonia last year, while 13 792 moved out.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of the movers and movers are Estonian citizens, but more of them are among those who leave.
Therefore, last year the migration balance of Estonian citizens with 2000 people was in decline.
Estonians mostly travel between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion charms with sats, embroidery and a fight
The bottomless ark of ideas, however, is history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream somewhere in the museum for hours and admire old sleeves and collars.
When you do something with passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
Mammu Couture's glamorous world may seem a stranger to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
It's up to you to decide how much brilliance you have in your life!
I've got a girlfriend who's got a whole sauna full of my Haute couture dresses.
Because it's not his fault he doesn't live in Hollywood and he doesn't go on red carpet every day, he wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and he wears them!
You can live your own life special!
A fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everyday days.
It was this thought that made the plan to bring high fashion to rural areas, between forests and fields in Estonia, to people that fashion often fails to reach.
Mammu's collection was presented in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion alley, where 45 models filled the entire street with royal de fillet.
In Tallinn, the posture is often taken in, nodded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - shouting bravo, standing up, wanting to thank you by your hand.
A lot of the audience just came around, but now they're Mamma Couture fans.
If you exceed people's expectations, they'll be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre-long red carpet full of beautiful dresses all over the street, and it didn't seem like they were going to end!
Maria also does not admit the fashionable way that creation must be presented to a super-sex supermodel, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they've always been happy to come.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show myself, I'm always backstage to give things a final touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves won't allow me to sit in the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who wants to be in everything, not just to play a role, but to be in it by his hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio. I'll do most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not just about design, it's about stylistics, logistics, organizing, organizing, everything needs to fit into a temperamental woman's day.
I guess those hours are gonna be huge for fanatics.
I can't even tell when my day of work ends, it's just a day of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of luck: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
It's been said many times that there's magic in my dresses -- they make me feel like a princess.
The plentiful tulle lines that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained Mammu Couture's signature to this day.
Martin Müürsepp of U18 boys: The Estonian subgroup tournament weapon has now been turned against us
I'm sorry, I'm out of fairy tales.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn't get our desk.
And if there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to do," commented Martin Müürsepp, our only basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo's assistant coach, who played in NBA, about the failure of U18 basketball boys 61:75.
Opposers took 28 balls from the attack table and got so many more attacks.
We weren't prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build protection.
In defense, however, they were able to hold hands everywhere, and we couldn't combine.
It kicked the team's legs.
The homework of the opposers was better done.
According to the mason, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to reduce the momentum of its opponents in the bud.
In the last quarter, we had a zero error, but the opponents have already had several quick baskets.
Athletics and intense insistence, which was our weapon in the sub-group tournament, turned everything against us now.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tassi.
At the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, so far there was a uniform punching fist.
It's a pity that such an aggressive opponent wasn't met before.
The cup has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has borne quite a burden.
But he made some pretty nice moves I've seen in practice before," added the supervisor.
Horrible numbers: the ladies' basketball team scored less than 10 points on the EM tournament in three quarters...
In the U18 age class, it is not only young men's EM B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, and the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And unfortunately, the Estonian game with Poland was in the area of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it stood at 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes the opponents took their foot off the gas pedal and the period was tied at 16:16.
In the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4, the third dropped 1 point...
In the beginning, in two minutes, the Estonian women caught two of the first four shots, then 25 of them missed the game, then one in three and then 21 more shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour, one of 47 shots was caught.
In addition, there were 2 points out of four free throws.
There was a reasonable number of ball losses during that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had 33th and Estonia had 13th percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, and on the opening day it was necessary to acknowledge the superiority of Portugal 83:56.
NATO vessels have come to Tallinn to replenish their supplies
Today NATO’s 1st Permanent Mine Control Group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit to improve the supplies of ships and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
In the course of the visit, the ships prepare for the nasting of the sea and provide crew members with the opportunity to take a couple of days' rest.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and prepare for future operations to search for historic explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation training in local waters well illustrates our integration with allied forces," said Captain Major Arto Reinmaa, commander of the operational and planning division in charge of the Navy Fleet Commander.
Since 29 June, NATO’s 1st Permanent Mine Control Group is led by Latvian Navy Lieutenant Commander Gvido Laudups, who took over the task of group commander from Estonian Navy Officer Commander Johan-Elias Seljamaa at the ceremony held in Riga.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also has a group command post.
This semester, the international unit also includes the mine hunter Sakala of the Estonian Navy.
As one of the four groups of ships under the command of NATO’s marine command, NATO’s 1st Permanent Mine Control Group is a rapid primary response unit that the Alliance can send to various parts of the world within five days.
Until August 4-13, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, launched by Maestro Erikas 13 years ago, will be considered.
According to Risto Joost (36), the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic, this year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The classics "Travita" and "Tosca" of the opera world reach the listeners, and the ballet performances from the enchanting "Boleros" to the fun "Karlsson" and there is no lack of self-production, which is this time the production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorium "Years" by the same international creative team who brought Haydn's second masterpiece "Creation" to the stage on Pirita in 2015.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose fascination takes hold and will never let go again.
Because the experience that the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human perceptions in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for your first year.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klas' shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it's been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my conducting career.
Maybe that's why it makes it easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much good into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, all this will be passed on to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
The great heart of Eri Klas also gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could turn the audience on this year's festival that you're offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet written on Astrid Lindgren's story will be presented.
It's "Karlsson Flys."
And one of the chaotic nuances is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his wish to write the work.
Apparently, he's had a Karlsson character in his soul since he was a kid.
Risto, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have a lot of that.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions aren't as much dependent on other people as I am on myself, maybe how I'm going to face every new day.
And that kind of conscious tone-keeping, holding a positive attitude, and actually smiling at yourself in the mirror in the morning, greatly increased my lucky percentage.
Especially this week, when there are the most important tests, I have practiced it especially eagerly and it works.
Smile for yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but everyone will discover it gradually.
Now, here's the big moment.
Do you have any ritual before you step into the conductor's remote?
Yes, it is. You'll have to change your clothes for more comfortable ones.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But, generally, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before the big show or take a nap.
In fact, I actually like to communicate actively with people, even before I stepped into the conductor's remote.
But all of you come to Birgitta Festival, here's what you can discover for not a very big opera and ballet friend!
Check out the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out to evaluate their age medically with an innovative approach. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of those tested were judged older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of age during the asylum application after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of alleged minors.
To date, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 years of age or older, and in 25 other cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the testee "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18".
Tests are only used if the age of the person is under question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute for Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see a big difference from the statistics of previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the Institute issued 581 test results and said that 442 cases "are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older".
But when the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of those 581 tests, it turned out that 243 cases had been directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which uses X - ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints, has been criticised by dentists and radiologists in some circles.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include evaluating people’s biological maturity to see if they passed puberty sooner or later.
"I have had good reason to think about it, and I do not think that the method of measurement currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to Metro.
But Johan Göransson, from the Institute of Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of the child being misplaced into adulthood is small.
At the highest, or about 10%, there is a risk if a person is just under 18."

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old hammer-thrower, made a beautiful debut on the MM of London, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
The organ was the youngest woman caster of M.M., and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80) I immediately did my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) I managed to keep my head clear", Orel said after the competition.
I was looking for my throws, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's M.M. debut ended in a fine 18th place.
The rain didn't bother the organ, because it's training winter through TTU Stadium.
"I'm hardened," he said with a little smile.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel sense people around him or was he able to turn himself off?
I did, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it'll add - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with the M.M. debut and that he will still have many good competitions: "I came here this year with the 32nd or final result of season 32, I ended up in 18th place.
That's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old, and MMil - that's all that matters.
I take along a good experience, and some days I want to compete for medals.
The Governor of West Virginia announced a party change.
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at a meeting on Thursday night with President Trump that he would change parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought about many things... today I say to you, to the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as democratic governor."
At the gathering, there was joyous exhilaration.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a great announcement at the West Virginia gathering.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business he inherited from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that 'the change of the Governor Justice's party is another blow to a democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from being better again than working for it'.
"All 15 governors and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of the party, which is led from the top to the bottom and unable to find a positive and unifying message," said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there's a lot of people, there's a lot of injured people.
Urmet, who was in the medical tent at the Weekend, told the evening paper yesterday that they had to distribute a lot of Band-Aids.
Wools and bruises are basic, twisting and slight falls.
And, of course, head, back and leg pains.
Urmet said that visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes, and that's how the problems come.
Medics have also had to assist visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
Let's do the smaller stitches here, send the bigger ones to the hospital.
Check the video to see if the celebratory medics are asking for a painkiller to treat a hangover.
Coe commended the Russians' honest apologies for the doping scandal.
Sebastian Coe, the international champion of Athletics, commended him for the doping scandal of "Russia's Thursday's Fair Apologies", but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country back to sports.
At the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship in Russia, Dmitry Shylakhtin, the leader of the Russian athletics, said that the ban imposed on his country is correct and that he has a clear aim to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletics who have been snatched from the gold and silver medals in the competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on competition imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to journalists.
"The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian alliance itself admitted that they had had quite a difficult time and that they would do everything possible to restructure the alliance."
Coe also said that he was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for reinstatement.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but the congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the right time for Russia's withdrawal," said Coe.
"We must do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always based on the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletics who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes in the world athletics championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet several criteria for reinstatement.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that the doping control was still inadequate and that the banned coaches were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution significantly change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mine giants like Glencore can say they win from one place and lose from the other, smaller mining companies won't help.
Glencore currently earns from coal and oil, but demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow in the future in the era of electric cars.
This year, the United Kingdom, France and Norway have made contributions in terms of the distribution of electric cars, which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
That is why Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla is placing on the market a cheaper model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that electric cars will be sold more than oil-fired cars for two decades already.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," said Capital Economics raw materials analyst Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
There's about three times as much copper in electric cars as in ordinary cars, Glencore reported.
More copper is needed at charging stations, so Exane BNP Paribasi estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore derives a growing trend in electric cars from the rise in copper prices and the fact that it is the world's largest cobalt producer, forecasted by the Jefferies Group.
According to this brokerage company, the other winners from the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Exchange has cost 70% of the cobalt.
The price increase last year was 37 percent.
Copper has also risen by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose by 20 percent in London, overcoming the price rises of Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
Lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine are on the losing side, which have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of lead is the power-supply batteries for petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the decline in demand", said Michael Widmer, the analysis manager of the metal market at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Lead in the form of price movement is not yet noticed as the unfolding trend.
Lead has risen by 17% this year, which is the best metal in the price increase for the major industrial metals in London.
Investors still see metal problems in the future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition," said the metal broker Triland Metals sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
If the demand for lead falls, it will be slow.
Maybe that's what's gonna happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, stricter exhaust emission standards mean that demand for hybrid cars will increase, depending on lead-based batteries developed during the frequent start-up of engines, and will be assessed by the international research organisation for lead and zinc.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further away with less electricity.
This explains the additional aluminum demand of 1,6 million tonnes up to 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the total world production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to deepen, said Widmer.
Aluminium has risen by 13% this year as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of lightweight car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist aluminum.
"Exane BNP Paribasi's analyst Sylvain Brunet said that high-strength steel should be the answer to this development."
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this metal was used as catalysts for diesel cars, reported metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many of the currently high demand raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have high demand in the future", said Bernard Dahdah, the raw materials analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum producers believe in the continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore's leader, Marc Grynberg, said that in 2025, more hybrid cars will continue to be sold than pure electric cars.
The great hope of the platinum producers in the 10-year perspective has been developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motosi on hydrogen cell-based cars that depend on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
Until now, however, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"Diisel seems to have a clear loser on the way to the electric cars", said Exane BNP from Paribas Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July, as the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche’s hometown.
How the financial rules of football affect the transition of Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar’s world record from switching from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain club in Barcelona, France.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial rules for fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011 (FFP) mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the Neymar switchover was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar’s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s going to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to raise such money to recruit Neymar and add it to its stellar lineup, given that the team is financed by the family of the Katari Energy Fury.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of the football business.
FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into great debt in search of success are actually cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners were to give up support.
As of 2011, FFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of the clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then to make a big deal of money to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
In the present three-year assessment period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the disgraceful rejection of Platin from the presidency in 2015, Alexander Ceferin, a successor of his UEFA, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said The Associated Press Andrea Traverso last week, who is the supervisor of FFP at UEFA.
Although PSG paid for Neymar’s buy-in clause in the form of a single full payment, they are able to split this amount into tranches for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, which makes it possible to demonstrate the transitional fee over the next five years as an amount of EUR 44,4 million per year.
On the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi’s Manchester City, received the most severe sanctions.
PSG was granted a fine of EUR 60 million (currently USD 82 million), which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to outsmart regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through its owners’ affiliated companies.
While a company in Qatar may sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as a formal income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support was overblown.
It has been said that a part of Neymar's PSG service may come from Katar through payments by the World Championship Management Committee in 2022.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador to the World Championships and claim that the UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition of Neymar in advance with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is ensured as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG.
The latest published reports show that PSG made profits of more than EUR 10 million in the 2015-2016 season at around EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will have a positive impact on sponsorship, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 per cent in turnover due to the conclusion of the agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar from moving, claiming that the PSG was thus in breach of FFP.
"This is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's attitude that the state finances the club.
"This is the result of property rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the state may have other ways or other interests for such a large player to represent the country."
Norway’s low-cost airline Norwegian has a nice tradition of putting images on the plane wedge of those who have shifted borders in their own area and been an inspiration to others, writes trip.ee
Along with the expansion of the geography of Norwegian activity, the circle of people who earned a place on the plane's keel has expanded.
Among the selected individuals are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (on the photo) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, a plane will be decorated with the portrait of Queen’s legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
Today 50 years ago: a hurricane storm in Estonia that ripped roofs and windows from buildings.
A hurricane called the storm of the century, which on August 6 and 7 caused serious damage to Läänemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular.
During these days the wind speed in northwestern Estonia was more than 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
It was all dark and rabid, like the end of the world.
In 2002, the old lady Linda Kurova recalled Haapsalu in an interview with the magazine Eesti Loodus.
Linda’s husband saw her garden collapse.
But what are you gonna do with your hands, where you're gonna get against a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, sprayed water out of the windows," said Mrs. Linda at the time on the Kalda Street in Haapsalu.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the platform roof of the railway station had flown 20 to 30 metres away, Linda saw the next morning, like most Haapsaluns.
According to the locals, behind Paralepa the trees were lying on the ground, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm ran through beautiful old trees with cracks and cracks like war.
Lääne-Virumaa was not severely damaged in the August storm in 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was also severe, wrote the Virumaa Journal in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were wiped off the face of the earth, but the parks in our area were severely damaged as well.
The wind speed in Tallinn was measured at up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the night of August 6th in Tallinn, a little girl had shouted: "Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer get down!"," wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The building of Põlli Manor in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm in such a way that it was decided to demolish it later.
The constructions of Türi ski jump hill did not survive the August storm, which was not later restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star newspaper wrote that the harvesting of towns and settlements from fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and the residents could contribute to the cleaning.
Crop fields were also badly damaged in the storm, and the newspaper stated that "the first party organizations must be both promoters and directors of the organization and the harvest".
You can talk about hurricanes if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of wind winds in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu was measured at a wind speed of 48 m/s.
On the Vaindloo island, the gauge broke, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning and poor coastal weather
Colder summer weather also means less tidy in Tallinn’s bathing areas.
"If there's weather, people are on the beach, and if there isn't, there's no people," says the beach cleaner.
Seagulls are screaming on the North-Tallinn Stroom beach.
They are faced with a melodious competition from a low-turning tractor that plows stripes on the beam.
In fact, the latter sifts seven centimetres [7 cm] of sand, picking out marine debris and people’s leftovers — bottle caps, cigarette butts, and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If the weather is beautiful, then the people are on the beach, and if it is not, there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, director of the Haabersti Administration beach cleaning works.
It's 6:30, and there's a bitter cleanup on the beach, because at 8:00, the place has to be okay for people.
Usov's on duty by 4:00.
Besides Stroom, he also keeps an eye on the shores of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Pikakar.
Garbage has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can appreciate what they're doing for them now," says Usov, who's been cleaning beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on the Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea litter washed up on the shore.
At Pirita Beach, for example, 400 000 tons of it must be transported to the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," says Usov.
Another major category is household garbage, or all that people leave behind.
There are eight large waste containers on the shoreline of Stroom, which need to be emptied three times a week.
So much garbage.
However, colder summer weather has meant that garbage is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third species are abandoned objects.
They're mostly children's toys.
This time, Usov has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They wait for the owners on the wooden road to the beach.
Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
Kids come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Disperse garbage
Erika Scholler, representative of Haaberst’s administrative services, admits that the tractor screening work is disrupted by locals.
A noise that lasts from night hours to early morning interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
In the day, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," says Scholler.
But the goal, like Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, is to get the Stroom beach under the international blue flag quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained", says Scholler.
We have more adventurous rocks and harder to sift.
However, there is less garbage on our beaches than in other parts of Europe.
When Martin, who lives near Stroom Beach, talks about garbage on the beach without compulsion in a conversation circle between journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a nasty picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle-pickers who have pulled garbage bags inside out," says Martin.
While it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviours so far, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about garbage cans and put covers on them, for example, to prevent birds from going on there.
In general, however, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroom's beach.
I can see the city's taking care of it.
Children’s fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, have become more pleasant.
It used to be that only one could drive on roller skates", Martin notes.
Treasurer's Findings in Stroum: Coins, Only Coins
A 40 - year - old Dimitri, who as a treasure hunter combs the beachside with a metal detector, has come to take advantage of the morning period.
He doesn't think he'll find anything valuable today or in the future.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough.
"I've been doing this for a year and I haven't found anything valuable so far," says Dmitri.
As a hobby hunter, Dmitri’s treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps, and dangerous nails that later throws into the trash.
It's usually coins.
"There are usually no gold, no rings, no such things," states the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the same level as weak growth and inflation relief have softened speculation due to the rise.
Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish, as household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policy-makers of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to maintain the 6:2 rates at 0.25% and fewer members are demanding an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for this increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its growth forecast for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on household incomes would persist as inflation is still expected to rise to close to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signalled that the increase in rates will be necessary to contain the inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that there may be a need for a higher than expected increase in credit costs in the financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the Mammoth package, which was launched as a result of Brexit.
In February, the bank will terminate a fixed-term financing scheme offering banks cheap funding, although it said that now a GBP 15 billion larger offer is expected under this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
The bank states in the minutes of the decision on the set: "In the medium-term forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will be powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
As regards rates, it was repeated that, in order to alleviate inflation, 'some tightening of monetary policy' is needed, to a "some greater" extent than is expected in the markets.
The stock exchange is now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps would be gradual and limited.
The Bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for the increase of 1.8 % in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the exchange rate for the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The nail fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators which have dampened the growing expectations of the rise in GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up some momentum at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little cause to the households suffering from rising inflation and wretched wage rises, saying that the situation would get a little worse before it recovered.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income shocks in the next few years, but a marked recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision will come one year after the rates were taken last August at 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for higher rates, as inflation had increased pressure on households in distress; in July, three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although according to the bank it was expected and there will be a rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco's mortgage brokers, said: "In view of the recent fall in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more and more competitive once again, as lenders are eager to work and hope to complete the year in a positive way.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to close, as refinancing, often at a fee-free and low rate, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is writing 10,000 people out of conflict with HIV drug
Patients have had access to "transformative" HIV preventive treatment since September following the battle at the Supreme Court about whether the NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that public health now makes available pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial, which have shown a reduction of around 86% in the risk of infection in people at high risk.
NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court’s decision last year that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the institution’s own allegations that the medicine should be financed by local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, CEO of NHS England, welcomed this exercise, which was announced on Thursday as a "new massive intervention", while the National Fund for AIDS (NAT) described it as "a turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. In October, there will be more clinics before the program is implemented everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials indicate that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in your body to prevent you from getting HIV.
These medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Eligible candidates include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV infected and not treated.
The clinics identify suitable individuals who agree to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register at a local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive medicines this week after the international tender procedure.
The purpose of a clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who it is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new massive intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in over three decades' struggle against one of mankind's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, acting director of NAT, said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted for those who need it and are at risk, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk for HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool, funded by this NHS clinical trial, which is individually manageable and independent of negotiations with a partner, thus improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Terrence Higgins' fund CEO, Ian Green, said: "It is now essential to ensure that a clinical trial is quickly initiated across the country and that no HIV-risk group is excluded.
Now that the medicine for the PrEP clinical trial has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Public Health Shadow Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and dragging the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to the prevention of HIV and the eradication of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is implemented as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, while Latvia and Lithuania fell.
In July, the difference in the exchange price between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros this June, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference is the breakdowns in the Lithuanian-Swedish connections.
The average exchange price of electricity in Estonia last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price of Nord Pool was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven percent, respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved 75 per cent of the last month’s hours towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not have the following day's transactions.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99 per cent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 per cent of the hours had total transmission capacity in use.
According to transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the exchange price for electricity may be around 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the electricity production price increased last month and the transactions took place at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living a high life - a semi-floor and smart design tips have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, traded his big Knightsbridge home in 2014 for Earls Court apartment.
It's on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace and Joanne's not packing her bags and selling the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be the same for the price I offered.
I was shown this apartment at Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has gone through a complete upgrade.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout – to reach the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-storey to use high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Duck & Shed, an architectural and design studio in Erfan Azadi Notting Hill, to take advantage of the 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so there was an architectural challenge to create a semi-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to come up with a creative approach.
"Metal construction is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would be placed on top of each other without having to bow down.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure to ensure that both the height of the upper and lower spaces were correct."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two rooms, full height, with many dramatic elements, on top of each other in the room.
From the half-storey, the old copper - lighted Retrouvius window opens a view of the glamorous living room below.
Golden furniture with mirror surface, silver details and a retro-threading Serge Mouille luminaire emphasizes the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and light saturation.
Mirrors have been added at both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the rear wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage space for all Joanne's utensils and glassware.
To the living room, the charm adds the possibility of closing the kitchen section when it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, there is a unique fact about this kitchen that it is a garage-type raised door.
"There was a bit of design effort in it," Erfan explains the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when it is pushed up."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," Erfan says.
"The real estate broker steps into an out-of-date form of a room and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are what you touch and thus contribute to the emotional bond with your home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the tongues of the heart ring."
This shows that a good design and increased surface area help to make a rather ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even make me want not to leave, as Joanne did.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago skyscraper bounty hunter competing with a colleague for promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money you earn, along with all ethics.
A man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself thinking that this is the version of "Card House" in the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's tone of speech is similar.
As the film goes on, the smaller the framehouse element becomes, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers is starting to appear ever more.
A life-changing experience is that the protagonist becomes ill with his son’s cancer.
A choice must now be made between work and family life.
A son who dreams of being an architect makes his father take walks to the large buildings in Chicago think about truly important things, such as faith, goodness, love, not even the disaster of the twin towers.
After the third scene in which the son opens his father’s eyes, the filmmakers feel that they have pursued the goal of getting the audience to cry, for even the most curly-hearted viewer can’t hold back tears in the sight of the suffering of a beloved cancer patient boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, his father finally understands the morale of his work and does a good deed to an old man looking for a job.
Now, I bet on myself in the sense that if the movie has a happy self, I'll reward my insight after the film with coffee, but if I'm wrong, then the writer can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment there's a suspicion that I'm gonna lose my coffee... when my husband calls Dane from the hospital... and he's rushing down the hall to the room in slow motion.
Rather, the son has miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it will prove positive, for now is the time to deal with the family.
I get to feel good too - I can predict the end of American drama pretty well already!
In fact, the film is well-designed, all the necessary elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good, and morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will bring in a good one.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information that President Trumpin is reaching, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a leveler water.
Here's a break from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with high-ranking officials on his first day of work, he pointed out a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he planned to solve by reaching the President's hands with bad information.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through her, either on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he were to be given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits have not gone away.
"If the candidate Trump was upset about the unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also fairly reflected in the affected publications," said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
At the time, Politico Tara Palmer wrote that "the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a stable hymn of praise."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know Trump's tweeting would have been even more arousable without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about trumps that Trump didn't post.
If his assistants could save him from trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House of competing clicks, people try to promote their own interests exclusively by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the whole story, wrote in May about the willingness of advisers to feed the president strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is this:
"Current and former Trump employees say that Trump may react to a negative press, especially information leaks with damaging effects, explosively, obsessed with identifying their source.
This was also the case at the end of February, when someone gloatfully printed a copy of the article by the Internet promoter Charles C. Johnson on the GotNews.com website, which accused Katie Walsh, Deputy Chief of Staff, of being the White House's "source of multiple information leaks".
It doesn't matter that Johnson is permanently blocked from Twitter for mocking or that he didn't offer any specific evidence or that he's been making false accusations in the past and taking them back.
Trump read the article and started asking his employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that at the time Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Head of the White House Office Rob Porter "have attempted to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trumpin".
How'd you do that?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same thing three months later.
Maybe he's more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad to the capital do not get permission to perform.
Many foreigners perform music in the city centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the Evening Paper spoke admitted that they were playing in the Old Town without the authority's permission.
First we found three street musicians near Viru's gates who had brought as many dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with rastapats and shattered clothes were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite appearances, the only woman in the company played a story with a fun rhythm, while a man next to her juggling three balls and inviting the passersby closer.
The third man had sat next to them on one of the backpacks and smoked his own twisted joint in peace of heart.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who played with Noem and the ball juggling Bob, said they were playing music on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the presentation was to collect the ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the same evening.
On the question of whether they asked the city for permission to play music in the Old Town, shaking Noem and Bob's heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we'll never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and most of the time, we'll be given permits for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for that," Bob explained.
When we returned to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with musicians and were driving them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru Keskus to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played a violin, the other a clarinet, and the third had carried an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living," explained Trio pianist Mivosh.
Mivoshi says they're aware that you have to have a government license to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but we'll have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased 149 million euros of bonds in July as part of the euro area central banks’ public sector asset purchase programme, and the central bank’s bond portfolio increased to 4.36 billion euros in total.
The central bank will not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The Governor of Eesti Pank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in reply to an inquiry by the members of the Riigikogu that the Eurosystem central banks’ asset purchase programme includes three different purchasing programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who sell them to invest money elsewhere.
The purchase results in lower return on the lower-risk assets, which motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, each central bank buys its own government bonds under a public sector bond purchase programme, while other national bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the amount allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase programme is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank usually buys bonds from European institutions, such as bonds from the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s bonds were also acquired, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering’s bonds from June 2016.
From June onwards, both Elering and Eesti Energia will purchase bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
The travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners have once again fallen into a fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the council's dug ditch to win back the field that remains far from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field as a wealthy "millionaire district" near the baptized Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks after being kicked out of there in May, without being disturbed by the ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the guards by squeezing their vehicles through the unblocked part of the road that was left as a footpath.
The furious residents have been cursing the council of Solihull, saying that the council is "unnecessary to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after they were banished from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The Council must be shamed to take action, because they are useless in tackling the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
There were more of them last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with these things by obtaining long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying the council tax if the council can't even stop it."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said, "This is ridiculous. We have just seen the last of these travelers leave, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time the number has increased and even the horse has been observed on the grassland."
A representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite in the land near the Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with the Solihull police. We are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
It'll help to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The Weekend festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that real world top names have been brought to Estonia.
To the question of why Weekend festival is so important to Estonians, the Saar answers that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the festival for three days.
However, he admits that the real players have arrived in Pärnu.
"Watching this level of artists that has been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this musical genre will be brought home - this often does not happen in our area," says the Minister of Culture.
But what artists at the festival speak most about the island itself?
I think I'm a relatively old person, and for old people like me, I'm sure one of the most experienced artists Armin van Buuren who stood up last night.
After all, according to his tile twist, at some point all of us have been spinning our feet," he says.
But he does bring up many other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: starting with NO
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high", he says.
Take a closer look at the Night's Eve video!
Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism of car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would provide software enhancements for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the BMW Chairman, the company believes that there are "more intelligent options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the BMW home town of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce exhaust emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been eager to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, who remained silent about the use of so-called "false devices", which allowed the exhaust emissions to be adjusted to conform to the regulations when the car was tested, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month the former head of the thermodynamics division of Audi engine development was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused Audi of installing the system in order to circumvent the European emissions requirements, thereby extending an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be a huge blow to Volkswagen's luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools purchase EU flags for 20 000 euros.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union for the Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimetres of education will be provided by the 570 educational institutions of the European Union flag.
The flags are designed for indoor display, they must also be carried out in high quality printing equipment indoors with tunnel fastening, mediate the news portal of the ERR.
The flagvarda label reads: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the 570 flags is 20 000 euros at the price of the Ministry of Education, i.e. one flag costs 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist highlights a growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to cover the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which is sown by organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They're told it's important to change their routine.
Two senior journalists discuss who seems safer: either bring the children with them to the office, which was the target of the 2009 grenade attack, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "Allies".
They're asking reporters to give names to each column, no need to provide evidence, enough impressions and intuition.
There is a suspicion that drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are on the payroll of government or cartels that the entire list of bad guys who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no break from violence, and the more corpses that accumulate across the country, the greater the number of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, is at least 25.589 journalists, after attacks and threats under national protection, and during this year at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The latest casualties include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep feeling, although his presence can be felt everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building a large picture of Valdez showing the middle finger with the inscription "justice" and two 30s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts with his smiley face or his characteristic Panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters will discuss joint trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate State Prosecutor’s Office was established in 2010 to deal with cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, which amount to thousands, journalists' killers rarely come to justice.
The Riodoce editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the killers' data and justice, the security meeting Ibarra says it's of little use.
"It's very silly to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"As long as you don't know the reason, you're distrusting everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped him by red Toyota Corolla, forced to get out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates into "twelveth River".
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, the subject of Valdez is largely silent.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition of Sinaloa to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's most bloody battlefields because rival clicks are fighting to fill the power vacuum.
It does not matter that a person or even several are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the graveyard is full of abundantly decorated double - narco - king mausoleums larger than the homes of many living.
For a moment, let us forget that the time of peace indicates that only one cartel is leading a maritime state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce’s co-founder and manager, Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels the enormous remorse that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with the leader of the cartel, Damascus Lopez, which competed with the sons of Guzman and was at war.
This piece may have angered the sons by suspected gang members who bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid took place in another newspaper that covered the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always exist.
He worked for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 as a veteran reporter when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "was impossible to deal with the press without having to deal with a drug problem".
In time, the newspaper gained recognition with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising increased.
The reporters liked to publish powerful studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication from which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its Latin American reflections.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) Prize for Freedom of the Press for his courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to keep living," he said when he accepted the AKK award.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the task of playing dumb with the press.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce Collective longs for Valdez, a joker who conjured like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and counsel, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went across the street from the office to an El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the love of his routine became fatal to him.
His death has also caused them to doubt themselves about how to do their work best and how to stay alive.
"They don't like it when you mess with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," said Bojorquez.
Even in the best of times, the result is strong self - censorship and self - maintenance.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Riodoce's editor Andres Villareal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that Sinaloa no longer have old rules, just as they do not apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, or other states, which are home to the toxic combination of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for a relief from the 40-degree heat in the tree.
The government assigned them to guard Riodoce's office in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered if these police officers were among the 50 percent of police officers whose governor himself had mistrusted.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous rural areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
This week’s edition of Riodoce dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were abducted from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to be careful to write what everyone in the city knows about the restaurant is a favourite place for both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered as a politician in the power of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, a number of IRP governors have been accused of being extensively involved in corruption cases.
Villarrea asked a reporter to write about previous incidents in the same location, including how the son of Guzman, carrying the nickname El Chapo, escaped the military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column for information on kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known by now what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose clenic body structure has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels have been cut off with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected activists to do on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration about another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
The body has been found burned, and according to the officials, it belongs to him on DNA tests.
Journalists throughout the country have become louder and scribbling the phrase "SOS press" as an organised protest on pavements and buildings.
On that day, Head Bojorquez will be away in Washington, trying to raise international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez died, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Afterward, he asked to be diverted from reflecting the government’s activities, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "limited" by organised crime, co-cultted public officials and indifferent society.
In his latest book Narco Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by orders from politicians and security forces who are in league with organized crime.
Last year, the Media Monitoring Group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and civil servants.
"In Mexico, you will die because they want to silence you," said Ramirez.
The murders obviously have a bloodthirsty effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, probably signed by a cartel in Los Zetas, "I'm here because of my reports."
Next to his severed head, there was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in Chihuahua, a northern border state, after killing their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others proceed as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly spoke to the drug cartel in the headline "What do you want from us?" on the front page.
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a nervous decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they still have to watch the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as was probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexican apartment in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that reporting drug trafficking scares her.
"Mexico is on his way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce’s editors were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office drinking beer when suddenly everyone’s phones began to vibrate.
In Mazatlan, a coastal resort town, 19 people were killed in gunfights between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the area.
From that very sidewalk, reporters put news on Riodoce’s website using their mobile phone.
The cover of the next day needed to be changed.
The sirens ran along another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez peeked at the police on guard to see if they were vigilant.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his middle finger can be seen throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff carried his footsteps.
"How could you even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaurus used a protective colour to prevent enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though quite frightening.
Scientists have now made public the first findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by the Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It is so well-preserved that it was even possible to identify that its armoured skin was reddish-brown and its past had been somewhat "complicated".
The report published in Current Biology described the creature as "the best preserved armored dinosaur that has ever been found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a new nodosurus species that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110-112 million years ago.
Its unbelievably good preservation struck researchers who describe it as "remarkably remarkable".
According to National Geographic magazine, this armored vegetarian is the best preserved type of fossil ever found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He struck something that did not resemble the surrounding stone and decided to examine it further.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, an animal was developed to excavate 2,500 pounds (1100 kilograms) of land.
After all the hard work, the outcome is now ready to be brought to the public.
"If you squint a little, you can almost believe that he is asleep," said Caleb Brown, the leading author, researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
By studying his skin, researchers found that this plant - eater, although covered in scales and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely exposed to considerable risks from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This heavy - armored dinosaur used red and white to protect itself from predators and applied a cloaking technique called countershadows, which is also used by many animals today.
This, according to experts, allowed dinosaurs to better fit in and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs likely hunted him.
This 110 million-year-old nodosaurous family creature came to the news for the first time in May and is now being visited by the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory student at the Borealopelta Markmitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent over 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of scales on the body of the animal.
They discovered a countershadow - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower.
Although countershadows are common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopenta is much larger than the animals living today with reshadows.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted sufficiently by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred shadowing rather than the confrontation of a survival tactic.
But most animals using modern countershadows - e.g. deer, zebras, or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to work really hard to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a huge dinosaur with heavy scales shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous era may have been," Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the sexes also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues to its life, including the preserved contents of its intestines, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, thus reaching the sea with a stream, where it sank to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time Albertas was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to reach far further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin, but it has remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - just squint your eyes and it feels like she's asleep."
The Cretaceous Age was a time when huge two-legged carnivorous dinosaurs, terropods, wandered the Earth.
Although their all King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be hunted by some of his frightening predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster weighing 38 feet (11.5 m) long and six tons.
Scientists whose recent findings are published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and scales, and it is complete from cone to hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (5 m) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch spikes broke out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored plant-eater wandered through the current West Canada until the flooded river washed it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur’s underwater burial site helped to preserve its scales in excellent detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that lumpy scales along the dinosaur skulls continue to cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "This degree of survival is as rare as a lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the lumpy scales on the animal’s skull.
The right foot lies beside him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I'll be able to count the scales on his sole."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked.
Just the day after travelling to New York, it was sitting on a bed in a rented room through the St. Louis resident Airbnb, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He got into a post with a schoolmate after he used to.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Posts of @TheePharoah with the thread were shared over and over in his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area reported a real-time tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed, 18-year-old black man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street for four hours.
"This is crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He hung up on his phone, but he saw a tweet later this evening reporting a human gathering on Canfield Drive.
Photos of the police tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a sign saying, "Ferrguson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
He was looking at a real-time stream where a police officer was standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In the second video, another cop cocked a gun and yelled, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
"This isn't the kind of murder we're used to and what we could call typical."
I felt the creeps at the time.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, he went to his father’s home to pick up his six - year - old daughter and decided that the next morning they were going to Ferguson alone.
What took place with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary "Whose Streets?" (Whose Streets?) that will be premiered in cinemas on 11 August.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the point of view of people who live in this community and who filled the streets by demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter - wearing a flowery dress and wearing a crown with it - drove towards Ferguson, they again talked about a subject that they had repeatedly discussed before this morning - the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how a black community had to fight for its rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't not take him," said Ferrell later.
"What's going on right now is... a culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know it and see it and grow in the middle.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions and what we need to do to get free and free.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he does not personally experience brazen racism, he is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on the road to South Florissant, a place across the border from the police station, which had become a kind of campsite where activists were waiting for news about Officer Darren Wilson, who was eventually not charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with the local business owner, who made lunches.
They put together grocery bags and helped distribute them to protestors.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Minorities Association of Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It all worked out."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with a film director, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and the filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
Ferrelli wondered: "Are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such scepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often Caucasians - come to the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already dealt with his co-director, Damon Davis, a district artist known for his activism in connection with sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and the other six locals who were watched by the team after Brown was shot at for years.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that's how I was portrayed."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not "the leader of the ransomer, but the assembly of the community", as Folayan said - he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" records surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
'I felt like I was naked,' said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw a finished sheet.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrelli's story highlights and refocuss the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who, in the social media in 2012, invented the theme reference #BlackLivesMatter after killing a black teenager named Trayvon Martin, are homosexual.
"In a leading role, black homosexual women have maintained the movement in general," said Ferrell, "and this is precisely because we must constantly fight on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to carry all this burden."
Folayan agreed, stating that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women".
At the same time, he claims that "doing is not some kind of equal opportunity-making thing" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the center of the film because of her identity.
"He was the man who exploded the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that he was right on the front line, because living as a black homosexual woman at these node points is a lot at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras from Ferguson are long gone, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The probationary sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road lasts another 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in a region he calls home, simply a "danger".
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra that he has etched into memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
7 Tips to Cope With Hangover After Weekend’s Party
Some of the toughest male sons will find that after a drinky party, what a woe, it will help.
Or they say "avoid hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a healthy one.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painless as possible after today and tomorrow’s Weekend troll or other party?
Drink some water.
Drink down and onto, after a big party in the morning... or possibly even alcohol instead.
Since the body loses a lot of fluids while drinking alcohol, it needs to be recovered somehow.
With water, minerals are also washed out of the body, and so it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or mildly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure a hangover shouldn't go to Grandma's to break wood, which could be a fatal misdemeanor.
But a light walk helps the body remember what it's like to be alive again.
Lying in the tent and sleeping out the hangover is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give the body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're sick of drinking last night, I'm sure it's not worth trying to load a big fat steak in your stomach.
For example, start with fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars that slowly refresh your body.
If your health is already suffering around lunch, try broth, for example.
And a little later on, the back of the car.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will free your body from any water.
Like I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you are taking a painkiller to prevent hangovers in the evening, your liver will need to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and thus lose performance.
That's how you ruin your liver even more, and from now on, hangovers are even worse.
Plus, the painkiller won't stay in the body for long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach, it'll upset your already broken stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, get on well with yourself.
It's like walking, but walking doesn't give you an orgasm.
However, avoid being too active and crazy at the time of the hangover, physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Talk a fool to your friends and fellow sufferers, do simple silly things and laugh friendlyly at yourself and others (suffering).
Jokes and laughs may not make the hangover go away, but I'm sure they're more fun to take after-effects with.
One day, the hangover's gonna go away anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are wanted as suspects in murder.
According to the police, a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University are being hunted nationwide, becoming suspects after finding the body of a man with fatal stab wounds in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to the Cook County court records, on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren, accused of murder at first instance because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranneau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
The police received a phone call and found a victim in front of the Grand Plaza apartment building with several puncture wounds on his body.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and investigators consider stabbing as murder, while police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
University Vice-President for Public Relations Alan K. Cubbage said in an e-mail application that Lathem is now temporarily suspended and is forbidden to enter the campuses of Northwestern University.
"It is now the criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and Northwestern University cooperates with researchers," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior assistant in Oxford University Finance.
In an e-mail application, a representative of the University and Somerville College said: "We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help the US research institutions in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wished that he would turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the communications department at the Chicago Police Department, urges suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have a sense of where they are, but we are working more and more intensively to determine the exact location," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment number 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was a hideous sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He says security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lathami and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on the chronology of events and identifying the victim's background and exploring various motives, including the possibility that it was a family dispute."
Start-up companies that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of her employees at her e-commerce startup, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company in San Francisco that sells hair care products with 75 employees.
So he called on outsiders.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that is designed to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and hot line complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to pass C-level managers and address the board directly.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytic tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Errett, during the three years he has used Glint, he has gained a much better view of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to surveys aimed at sudden surveys and specific teams, it offers a company thermal map that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to understand that they need to stay informed about their working culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been wrapped up in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than $18.7 billion by 2020 according to the data on the Let's Talk Payments website for financial technology statistics.
Convercent, a start-up company operating in Colorado, Denver, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed this year an increase in interest and activity against the background of Uber’s dubious reputation.
Convert has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to send custom impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line allowing workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, complaints go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been adopted by the regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if it is found that a company treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, workers' departures and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees in 500 sites, has used Convert for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find a telephone number or email address at the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it will be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday’s general adviser James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way of monitoring employees’ complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convert, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which did not reach drivers who were operating in other offices in cities or states, can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to employees' holistic 360-degree experience," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media matured", did companies realise that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly washed online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by charging companies periodic fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both start-ups.
Converti was financed in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital for a sum of $10 million, thereby increasing the value of the capital raised to $47 million.
Glint invested 10 million dollars in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing from the company's total funding to 60 million dollars.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, given the interrelationship between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the stakes on the table.
Workers want to feel accepted and valued and to devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is Vice-President LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools can increase the commitment and involvement of employees, it is no wonder that they will find support.
According to experts from the professional culture, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
However, this data is useless if the company’s supervisors do not do anything about it.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can give rise to expectations that changes will take place.
And if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, this could lead to disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask 4000 proposals, you must be ready for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of the consulting and business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things don't finish, the employees will think, "Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, it has been possible for Madison Reedi, who now conducts monthly surveys among employees, to implement the measures on the same day as the problem was reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were disappointed with the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, he was able to restructure several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
However, in Ruby Tuesday, new data on workers are collected and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high turnover in the workforce.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, then you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The shining star of the euro area is the Baltics: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic States, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes referring to the report by the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999 total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Progress is driven by low indebtedness, rapidly improving institutions and a business- and free-market-friendly policy.
"The Baltic countries, together with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita has approached the EU average significantly," the central bank stated.
Although the aim is to ensure that the total output per capita of the economy is equal to that of the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total production per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries belonging to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is growing this year too, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the Latvian and Lithuanian population estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, less than half of those polled thought this about the economies of their countries.
NCAA’s decision to cancel twice daily training makes Bruins’ days long
It's almost 23 o'clock when a bunch of UCLA football players stop to chat at the edge of a new training field on the team campus.
Some of them have removed their shirts, exposing their sweaty backs from the first day of the training camp.
For most of the crew, these idle minutes offer a midday break.
After three hours of training, players who take part in summer courses go back to the dorm to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6.30 next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said Jim Mora, coach of Bruins, shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The decision of the NCAA to cancel training sessions twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually lengthened their days - at least until the final exams are completed on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 19:15 to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two trainings per day means more days with one workout – the beginning of the Bruins training camp was moved forward by almost a week compared to the previous season and for the first time during the six seasons of Mora Westwood, training takes place during summer courses.
They have 18 training sessions scheduled until August 20th before the official preparation for the opening game in September against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of a change in the rules of the NCAA, although this adds another item to the players' tight schedules.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they will break through this trial; they will make an effort; they are fine young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it'll be really nice."
When the camp is over, UCLA’s trainings are closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of their squares from the nearby parking lot and the nearby Luskin Centre, a top - class hotel already hit by footballs that have escaped the protection net around the gatepost.
Since this weekend, the Bruins players are taking over the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems can arise with vacant rooms during the season.
"We're taking security measures," said Mora.
"This is a real problem and it is not too much to think that people can rent a room and film training there.
If you have a record of your training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we'll use a security team there and in parking lot eight.
We're doing our best using what we've got.
I'm trying not to worry much about it.
We have a plan in place."
For revenge Savisaar-Ivanova Electoral Union born to the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland, excommunicated from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, founded by the forces forced to leave the EKRE, was founded by Our Tallinn and the Estonian National Electoral Union of Business Men, which was created to show the people of the Party Tegus Tallinn – it seems that the electoral alliances created at the initiative of those who have been burned in party politics will participate at least as much as the political parties in the local elections this year.
However, chicks will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
When Edgar Savisaar’s supporters have diminished, the events organised in honour of his electoral alliance can be expected.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and present central parties and many unknown faces - is that what the electoral alliance will be?
And can the reason why some loyal followers and friends of Savisaar avoid running in Tallinn is that the "Savisaar list", led by corrupts and suspected corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
The music video filmed on the roof of the city department for the Russian pop song, in which the mayor of the Lasnamäe district participates; and in every sense a primitive computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid puddles and squirrels on his bike – is this how the Centre Party catches the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed to the ballot boxes for the first time?
We look forward to seeing what other parties' perception of a youthful election campaign is.
If a Channel 2 or TV3 viewer receives a black square instead of an entertainment show from the beginning of August, there are two options: accept that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 channels will be available in the free range, or hand over a tenth of each month to a TV operator.
There are probably also those who, at first, publicly rejoice in their unpromotional television experience, but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and ads.
Compassing music, noisy people and trash left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you do not want to be a part of the jam yourself, instead of hurting your head at home, it is worth going to discover your country - and leaving the place to the festival guests for a good amount of money.
Washington is changing the rules of the green card.
Media publications quote President Donald Trump, who said that a new U.S. immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money because it changes the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, according to media outlets in the United States.
Siberian Seto youths move to the city, pensioners return to the country.
Evseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous Seto miners along the former Maana River.
He works as a driver in a gold brick at the tributary of the Maana River Kuvai, 140 kilometers from home.
This is hard work: for two months in a row without rest days, 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
During the three years worked in Artelli, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There is a hard order: when you go in, you check thoroughly to ensure that you don't bring vodka, and when you go out, you don't bring gold," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho chatting with the local Seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture of Siberian Setos, which is still preserved, will also influence the home Setos, because it is simply so amazing, thinks the most thoroughly of the remote Setos studied by Piho Mare.
His first study trip to Siberia will be 30 years this year.
During that time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many Setus still migrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
It's an unsolved issue.
I'm saying 8,000.
I calculated it from the story of the Siberian Seto men, who have thought of it themselves.
It is hard to say exactly, because at the time, up to 30 people in one group may have arrived, but the passport was given to a man only.
The passport was given to one person only, but his children, sisters and other female relatives were with him.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was many times bigger than the historic Setomaa.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas not only connected with agriculture but also with the river (palg rafting), gold mines, industry.
For example, many Setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos then make up the majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and childhood long prevailed.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much did Siberian Seto culture differ and differ from the Seto of Motherland?
They're different, even though what was brought here was once there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They made their own clothes, but they always knew the difference between what had been brought and what had been done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on Seto’s traditional clothing, since it is colder here.
There's been a change of pace.
For example, the meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are the Siberian Seto villages and what life is there? / Graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was spiritually strong; it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, begin to affect them.
Those girls who've lived here in families have been listening to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to visit Haida at the beginning of July to the Seto Kingdom Day and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's left of it, it's amazing.
"It is very easy to come to kill and leave, because the city has a great location: at the railway node and at the intersection of the highways," says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural sites, and pizza is available at every corner.
Kill is a top-top town!
There is a small island near the River White, where the killers tend to have a Midsummer party.
"You can't see this beautiful place in the train window," Reigo huggles.
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water can swim in this river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
You can have a picnic on the river and just do romance - you can watch the river flow and think of life ahead and in the back.
I've been walking there with my girlfriends.
The opera solo oak has been to the riverbank between the three bridges practicing his arias: "Because this place is by the town, no one may answer if I hum my own stories."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa from Männikumäe, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and now play discgolf, for example - the golf course is done, disks can be rented from the fitness centre", leads Reigo.
Old pros go there with their disks, of course, but I haven't been there yet.
It is probably necessary to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa, because he is an experienced discgolf player and has disks.
I think he'll lend it to me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during ski classes.
There are many tears and disappointments left on this mountain, and you can win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The entire city center is full of constructions now, all of this is changing beyond recognition," Reigo commends.
Kill the old and tired stationery, however, is a very attractive place where summer discoveries are played.
I am glad that in 2012 the manager of R.A.A.M., Märt Meos, accepted my idea and came to the station to do a summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with Aleksei Karenin has just ended, on August 11, the railway station will have "Life Awakening" when the old station is moving around in the 1980s.
"Until August 11-13, the days of Tapa City are during which home cafés have been opened in addition to the station hall and there are a number of cultural events, including folk rally," Reigo says, who recommends a visit to the 91-year-old city in those days.
In a small yellow cabin on May 1st, the museum has been in the boulevard since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and lots of information," Reigo praises a place full of the history of Tapa city, most of which focuses on railway and military activities.
Reigo smiles that when Tapa passes through all the recommended places, it gets hungry after a while, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good diners, and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you're abroad," he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town, but this international group is all around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we've got a lot of moves!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as stating that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of illegally camped people on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation now.
The State Department told the BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are caught resting in a place not provided for.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Puppy-taught wolves come to break sheep.
After a year's break, the farmers of Hiiumaa have to give their flocks "teaching material" to the wolves again - apparently the wolves who taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiumaa County have broken sheep three times, with a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the number was only three, a year earlier 124.
The data of the Environmental Agency is also in sync with the breaks that last year no wolf litter was born in Hiiumaa and information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that this year two wolf litters have been fixed on the island.
At night on Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste rural municipality and injured 18 surviving sheep half.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of Rheselja village and severely injured another who had to be killed.
Rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent the draft Act amending the Genetically Modified Organisms Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the coordination circle.
The amendment to the Act will abandon the creation of a separate database for both GM crops locations and operators, using the plant health register in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop operator to have a prior agreement with the beekeeping person within the prescribed limits is amended.
Although there is currently no cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until you decide to declare Estonia GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, Head of Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors", added Suu.
The draft Act repeals the provisions relating to GM crop location and handling inventory and handling training in the GMOVS, establishes requirements for GM crop handling and start-up activities.
In the specific case of beekeeping, the existing obligation of GM crop growers to inform beekeepers about the start of GM crop cultivation is replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of cultivation.
The draft Act has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult it in the information system of the drafts and to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs if they so wish.
The proposed changes will affect in particular those active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Authority.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in GM crop cultivation.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European corn lady, for which the MON 810 maize line is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this corn line have been developed in the southern regions, and this maize is not suitable for our climate.
In order to obtain the above assurance, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned in 2015 and 2016 studies to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in seeds of different varieties of summer rape, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above, it can be concluded that there is no conscious cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that no accidental contamination has occurred.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has enlisted "genius" in Nemanja Matic's face after the middlefielder against Sampdoria debuted on Wednesday night.
A player bought over 40 million pounds from Chelsea started a victory against Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 at the start of the game in the final pre-season game of United in Dublin, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were able to take their offensives freely.
However, with the exception of Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was in dire need of a match form, and he only lasted 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, this must be improved before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mindset," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get his uniform as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, started in the beginning of Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly started to set up his own man who started something by the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done "excellent work", concluding contracts with three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make it four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another stork boy got a GSM transmitter on his foot on August 1st and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird watcher living in the ring, the first stork son was equipped with a transmitter in Sõrve, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nesting grounds and joined the Mullutu-Large large overnighting pack.
This is because there is no field in the Sõrve, the Voice of the Islands writes.
This Tuesday, relatively late to ring cranes, another stork boy got attached to the transmitter on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork son named Mati was supplied with a GSM transmitter in Sõrve on Türju.
"His activities are all watching on the Internet: how he went to Spain in winter, when he came back to the border between Germany and Poland and then came to Saaremaa", said Martinson.
The British inventor had a microchip implanted in his body to get into the house and the car with a handtag.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could simply open his front door, get into the office, and even start a car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and forefinger and now provides this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, consultant-anesthesiologist at Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester Hants to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
Technology is similar to a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company will also change the locks on houses and cars to match the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married father of one child has installed technology now both at home and in his car at BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands.
According to the military documents made public to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the southern courtyard cost taxpayers as much as $24,000 for the American production event last month.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One during the President's time on board, was the central attraction of the event in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials have been exploring industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House military office requested a section order for the presence of the helicopter with FARGO just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south yard for the "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an event of unusually high attention," said the HMX-1 commander the day before the event in an e-mail to his superior, the deputy officer of the Navy in the field of aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive in the south yard at 7 p.m. on 17 July for the event starting at 3 p.m. and will remain there until the yard is cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same evening.
The fact that if leaving the White House were to be delayed was added, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restrictions on working time.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the squadron security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its time on the ground.
It was not possible to read out from the documents given to TIME magazine whether or not a second crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event might violate this provision.
"We asked if it would violate Hatch's law, and we were told that it would not," wrote the commander.
"It seems you have no choice," answered the deputy officer in charge.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law would never have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of the health reform in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to control government regulations.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them for a pure photo shoot is unusual.
Trump got attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, rolled a president's plane into the background, and his Twitter account was crawling with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display "made in America" which represented products from all 50 states made of American materials by American workers," said Lindsay Walters, acting spokesperson of the White House.
HMX-1 teams often test flights around Washington and the south yard to practice putting down the United States President's White House with centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 organised 58 attempts in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to the American-made flight crew was included in the training flight standard for that month.
The squadron helicopters flew that day for an additional 11 hours for "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits of this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky’s representative, the company was not involved in organising exhibits in the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep budget documents for Presidential flights and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence’s financial year 2017 hourly prices, the compensation rate for VH-3D is 24,380 dollars per flight hour.
The squadron's records indicated that the flight length was 30 minutes from the base of the naval Quantico airport in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
"It is very misleading to calculate the costs of taxpayers on the basis of the estimated compensation rates," said Walters.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs to be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Sean Spicer, former spokesperson of the White House, defended the use of the helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that the states of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are supposed to be hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it."
It is not clear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter during a tour of the south yard, but he was driving a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky’s representatives, making fun of the company’s products in his personal aircraft fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through tears peace and joy arrived
The 2011 MMil Deaegs hit Shadeiko in the last area, 800 m running foot ramp, and the girl was taken away from the stadium with a stretcher.
Shortly before that, he had received a zero jump on a universalist in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was injured by an injury in the low cost area, but in London he received a 23rd place by 6013 points.
However, the misfortune continued.
After the opening day of 2013 Moscow MM received a thumb injury in the Estonians’ long jump.
Two years later, he received 15th place on the Beijing M.M. and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but this had wanted more disappointment for the athlete.
The toughest gauntlet passed through Shadeiko only last year when it was not written in Amsterdam EM at first.
I'd just like to put together one decent multi-tasking once.
Once,' Confessed Shadeiko.
The worst was still ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was cut off on the first barrier due to a femur injury.
Time had to be taken out - do you want to continue with the seven races at all?
Is two days of effort really worth all this?
She thought long, but she found peace.
I got my head cleaned up.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that was just supposed to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and to think straight.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pill in the bag yet," says Shadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn over the clean slate and move on with a fresh start.
Coach Anne Mägi said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the subject, but he realized that the athlete had to figure it out for himself.
He was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Mountain.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He's doing it for his own good.
The competition came back in May, when Shadeiko set 6280 points for a new Estonian record at the Götzis multi-game competition.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top stamp with a bullet thrust of nearly three feet (13.89) and ran in a near-record time bump.
At that time, the multi-teaser sensed that it was not a ceiling of abilities, but that it was only the primary hunger of the race.
Mägi, who supervised him for years, says that Shadeiko is a model student.
He's a ready athlete. He's good to train.
If something's wrong or bad, he's gonna say it now.
He knows his body and trusts his senses.
That's what we have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the kind of person who makes the most of practice," he says, and he says that the most important thing is getting the right knowledge, because it also ensures a good result.
The happiness of a close baby makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by the happiness of her loved ones.
His former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-combator has received support from new citizens of the world.
"It's been interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol the drinking of which is the "training" of the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" wine taste process.
By sniffing the glass, spinning the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for the wine.
Sheperd said that wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but they are produced by the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the way the brain "sees" colors.
"Taste is not in wine, taste creates wine taster," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that wine is not to get drunk.
"There must be more in action," he says.
If you take a sip too big, the system will be saturated.
Overdrinking wine can do damage to the brain instead of benefit - according to the 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance, and reduced mental ability are at risk.
10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay from colleagues
Data from Fontes personnel search company reveal that 10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay than their colleagues.
The ten-percent pay gap between men and women is written by the portal Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in a pay survey in the ICT sector of Fontes.
In total, 8 577 posts were under consideration.
Sixty-three percent of the jobs were worked by men.
"While only three companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and that there is no pay gap in the opinion of the rest of the companies, the average monthly basic wage of men is 10% higher than that of women and the average annual wage of men is 8% higher than that of women," said Fontes analyst Ilmar Põhjala.
"Narcos" 3rd season commercial: now that Pablo Escobar is gone, Cali's cartel will take centre stage in the Netflix hit series
Despite the fact that Pablo Escobar's killer was exposed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service and the first of them has already completed a commercial clip that teases a series of new bad guys.
In the third season, the DEA will focus its attention on the world's richest drug trading organization, the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, "like a Fortune 500 company", with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the brain of Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is the leader of the cartel, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
The newly released advertising clip sees Pedro Pascal return to Javier Penana, a character who recruits American and Colombia's law enforcement to help with the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" will open on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The UN Head of Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are running for the local Soviet elections, three women are running for Vice-President, and more than 30 percent of the recently registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban has threatened the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's election marks the first time that power is peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that the strong role of women is increasing the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more intense for both the big and the small.
There is always too little time in common, but practice with kids gives a good opportunity to combine co-existence, game, proximity and load.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you cruise in the summer, you'll always have a live goose with you, and you'll be anxious to remember with your fine little voice: "Let's work out!"
Start with the warm-up - a normal game of heads or running along a beach strip is very good.
The crotch is the foundation of staying in the shape of feet and buttocks - who would want to take the shape of a sandcake washed out of the waves during the summer?
It's wonderful to use children instead of levers!
First, it is safe and comfortable, and the weight gradually grows at the same pace as the trainer's power.
The advanced can also crouch with quite large children.
A child trains balance, reads repetitions, and enjoys the opportunity to hang high and be important.
Larger children can crouch at the same time.
The extent of the movement is determined by touching the earth and stretching your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-constituent to hold on properly.
A child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
The plank is a very useful but hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it's easy to make it more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank column to slip through.
It's actually harder than usual, but it's a lot more fun to do than give a friend a hand in the meantime.
To add load, you can stay in a plump, a small one on your back, and walk around in this position.
An extra weight may be placed on the hips of a smaller child, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While crabs simmer in the sand, triceps, buttocks, and tummy muscles get a load like a snip.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight equally spreads to the front and back.
You can hold hands for safety.
Bend your legs and reach straight up.
Kid can fly, have fun, train balance and be a challenge.
Little coach's life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he wakes up.
There's an extra load for stretching your legs.
Make sure your back stays in neutral.
Children themselves have more fun making abs in pairs and claps.
Handiwork and a stick with a pulse.
Watch the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in neutral.
All the kids' favorite and big fun!
For the parent at the same time, a truly effective whole body workout.
The sports equipment was Ott (10), Spark (8), Happy (4).
From the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans
Armed bags are summer classics, which have become an individual hit product in recent years, which has to be hanging on the hand of one of the right souvenirs and which merchants have been able to weld a price tag for a hit despite its modest origin.
A bag made of straw is probably one of those things that has existed every time in life and possession of which has not caused much emotion.
It's just there, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
Now the straw bags are on the way to a real victory, and fashion fans have switched their fancy designer bags for the summer months for simple straw-brushed bags.
It is not just a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and bolder women even walk into the office.
At this point, however, it is worth making sure that this summer look is still sitting for the boss, or that it is worth pushing the martyr and laptop into a more formal sumadan.
Varietal wealth, however, has made straw bags truly the love of women in the summer.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to be noticed is that fashion gourmets rush to the local market on a holiday trip and buy a bag of straw, which they will be faithful to during the rest of their vacation and which goes along with the beach, the market, and also with friends hanging out on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags on the market and sell them or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that there is so much demand for bags among readers that women (and men!) in the real world would probably go hand-to-hand with each other to become the happy owner of some bags.
In a sense, such madness is also understandable, since these are rare times when in the fashion world it is possible to buy a hit - status thing for a few decades of euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way to make money here, and so the finer luxury brands sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably just so richer customers don't have to feel like mere mortals promenade around with cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana a shoulder bag worth over a thousand euros.
Chanel’s shoulder bag, however, can be interpreted at 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion hits, however, straw bags do not come from some big fashion makeup, but their story began far away.
Namely, straw bags come from a distant Philippines from which they have been transported.
Bundling a shoulder bag is especially an expori shop and the locals do not often see them hanging out with them.
Allegedly, the straw - purging technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite saran with the usual basket-pulling.
However, since the straw bag does not need to be braided as well as the basket, patterns and other materials can be embroidered in them, making the bag more personal and thus more actuarial.
For example, recently, particularly trendy bags have been braided with coloured ribbons or leather strips.
However, first and foremost, shoulder bags can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided fan of shoulder bags had never been seen before.
In fact, he fitted his shoulder bag with all kinds of outfit kits and didn't even consider it a lot to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of bags today does not play a smaller role, but also the fact that caring for them is a cockhead, and unlike all other Sumadas, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and a wet towel.
As usual in the case of trend rages, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations other than classical appearances.
For example, if you want to, you can buy a necklace or a tiny purse of straw.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but on a straw rickety, yes.
But what's the classic shoulder bag like?
For centuries, a bag of straws has been regarded as classic, reminiscent of a basket in its style, has been opened up and has been short, as well as short straws, handles.

Minimalism From the Eye of the Needle - Home to Details
A home with a golden touch in the milieu of Tammelinna
A woman builds a house instead of a funkhouse, a wooden house rose.
A missing man was found in Saaremaa three days ago.
The treasure left his home on Wednesday night in the village of Kärl in an unknown direction.
The last contact with the treasure was on the phone last night, Friday night, and the positioning of the phone gave the man his location to West Saare rural municipality, the village of Manurus, where he was searched by helicopter until midnight and with dogs until early morning.
Then his phone died, and it was no longer possible to locate him.
The police continued their search this morning.
The police are thanking everyone who contributed to the discovery of Treasure.
GMB is worried about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union expects the leaders of the cookie manufacturer McVitie to confirm long-term production plans at the Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent about the future of the Tollcross site investment.
More than 500 people work in a factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
The owner of McVitie's company, Pladis, said they've invested more than £5 million in the last few years.
They hired more employees and union leaders to be "the first to hear" if anything changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter addressed to the company’s object manager, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie’s request to "exercise concerns about the non-use of funding for the modernisation of production lines".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we do not get clarity from the main manager of the object about the business needs of Tollcross and the investment plan for the future makes our members deeply concerned.
There have been several generations of families working here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around Glasgow, which is an essential pillar of decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, and in view of the increase in living costs and the chronic decline in production, Brexit urgently needs a fast-growing company in McVitie."
Pladis's representative said: "Tollcross's object manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting took place in Tollcross between employees and representatives of GMB, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross site, most of which has gone to production lines and to improve operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and if there should be any changes in the activity of the object, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up on trying to lure Neymar into his ranks by making a bid of GBP 189 million to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record conquest?
This sensational approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than twice the current world record of the buy-out that was set up last season by the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
Once the changeover has been completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive over 500 000 pounds a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is, of course, angry about both the approach and the break-in of Neymar, although a source close to Catalans’ board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football player since its arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the president of the PSG warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed an interest in concluding an agreement with Blaise Matud in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who were thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll face them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed an interest in Marco Verratt, the center PSG.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
'Brex is seriously threatening to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland' warned Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders", he stressed.
He said that he would prefer Britain to remain a part of the European Union, and because it cannot do so, he would be a part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to smooth Britain's exit would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: 'We could definitely have this with Britain'.
An alternative would be to return to customs points, which would declare historical division and political failure.
"The barrier to trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that the result could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Belfast.
Märt Avant, who passed his first half-long triathlon: Ironman can pass by anyone.
Today, the winter capital Otepää held the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States, when about a thousand triathlons from over thirty countries took up the semi-long Ironman competition.
The distance of 70,3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21,1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avant ended his first triathlon triumphantly.
"I thought it would be complicated and eventually it was complicated," said Avandi in the finish line.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that triathlon was actually within reach of almost everyone.
"Not kill the distance, but kill the pace," he said, implying that at an affordable pace, almost everyone gets to the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: "It's all right with the physique, but unfortunately he can't swim."
Avandi had been working out eagerly since February.
First four or five hours a week, later ten hours a week.
At 05:34:12, he won 270th place in total.
Although Avandi lost to Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" contestants.
Tanel Padar, who was the "good example" last year, lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
A German named Johannes Moldan was crowned as the general winner of the calculation of the men of Otepää stage in Ironman's series 3:58:27, the best of Estonians was Ivo Suur in 04:14:09.
Among the women, Dane Helle Frederiksen triumphed with the time 04:24:01; of the Estonians Maria Jänese, who lost to Frederiksen in almost half an hour and became 04:58:58.
The avant passed a 1.9 km swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in position 410.
