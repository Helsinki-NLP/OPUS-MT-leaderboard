Members of the National Assembly of Wales fear they will look like the Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly are dismayed by the suggestion to change their title to the Member of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The issue began with a plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour member of the National Assembly said his group was worried because it rhymed with “Twp and Pwp.”
To explain to readers outside Wales: the Welsh word daft means dap, and pwp means poop.
A Plaid member said the group as a whole "isn't happy" and has come up with other names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "receptive" to the name change, but noted that the word "MWP" was very similar to "Muppet".
In Welsh, the pronunciation of the letter “w” is similar to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire.
A committee of the National Assembly, which is currently drafting a bill on the name change, said: “The final decision on all names by which members of the National Assembly are invited is, of course, made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the National Assembly for Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into proposals for the name, which broadly supports the idea of renaming the National Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the appointment of members of the National Assembly, the committee preferred the term "Wales MPs", but those in the public poll favoured the "MWP" option the most.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement could be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who is expected to propose a draft law on the changes in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the nomination of the members of the National Assembly shall remain with the members themselves.
Macedonians to hold referendum on changing country’s name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is being held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to the territory and has repeatedly objected to its candidacy for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the change of name referendum, has said he intends to ignore the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the name change is just the price a country would pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells are silent as the churches of Harlem are struggling
“The older people I’ve talked to have said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no more of either.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People communicate differently these days," he said.
“Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people are staying every day.”
When it comes to churches, however, he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and that “sooner or later they will be back at the beginning”.
Adams added that churches can be replaced with apartment buildings whose apartments are full of people who do not lend a helping hand to the remaining places of worship in the neighbourhood.
"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he added, "who will therefore accelerate the arrival of the day when all these churches close their doors, since it is unlikely that the majority of the people who move here will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white parishes before Harlem became a metropolis for blacks – the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black people who had previously worshiped God in the vicinity took over ownership of the building.
St. Martin’s Church was seized by an African-American congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of the 125th Street Shoppers in Harlem when they refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to restore the building, they adopted a carillon, or bell-tower.
Father Johnson's son and successor at St Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the carillon "the bells of poor people."
The expert who played the carillon in July gave it a different name: “cultural value” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to play the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
Played in St. Martin's Church in recent months, it has been the story of architects and contractors, some of whom have included secular leaders of the church, others a bishopric.
In July, the governing body of the church, consisting of secular leaders, complained to the bishopric in writing that the bishopric was “trying to pass on the costs”, even though the presidency was not even involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some members complained about the poor transparency of the bishopric’s actions.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy in California after diving for lobster
According to authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cries for help and then swam in to help pull the boy out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought the boy expressed his enthusiasm for getting the lobster, but “then realized the boy was screaming, ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!".
His whole collarbone was stripped naked," Hammel described the sight he saw when he came to the boy.
“I cried out to everyone to come out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water,’” Hammel added.
The boy was taken by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of the attacked shark is not yet known.
Lifeguard and Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that the sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that the shark was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located at the top of the hull.
Authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and safety purposes, from Casablad to Swami.
Giles added that there are over 135 species of sharks found in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, creating supermarket-like beauty aisles with expert advisors.
As part of a significant push into the UK’s £2.7 billion beauty market, which is continuing to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, wider line-ups of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores across the country, taking them to other stores if successful next year.
The reason they invest in beauty products is because supermarkets are looking for ways to take advantage of the shelf space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it plans to double its range of beauty products to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in brand areas such as those currently found in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its own line of make-up products, Boutique, in which most products are suitable for vegans, as young shoppers demand more and more.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing exclusive sales permits in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second opening this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift from buying small amounts of food every day from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to try harder to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that outlets are becoming more and more similar to supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to fight against low-cost retailers such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitats outlets since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which is said to have supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
Supermarket's earlier attempt to upgrade its beauty and medical products departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury’s attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended in a dispute over how to share the proceeds of the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxurious skin care products to its four store range, including from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our beauty product aisles to improve the environment around them.
We have also spent money on specially trained employees who are always ready to advise.
Our range of brands meets every need. However, the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive beauty trade destination that can change the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious at Holly Willoughby’s £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby dropped an £11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby lacks time for Truly, a brand of household goods and clothing.
The pair's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old TV host of This Morning has announced his resignation on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a fit of anger, stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on their new successful deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "angry" when a TV star girl testified at a tense meeting Tuesday at the man's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts of £1.5 million meant she no longer had enough time to dedicate to the homewear and clothing brand Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main preference.
It was supposed to secure her long-term future, so she thought she'd be doing it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in the matter in complete astonishment.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to putting the product line on the market.
Marlow's headquarters have a warehouse full of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning, one of the UK’s most paid celebrities, could cost the company millions because of the huge amount of money invested in products ranging from sofa cushions and candles to clothes and homewear.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016. The 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as chairman in March.
Couples go on vacations together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes an M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin on the ITV television series I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “I don’t want to comment on his business.”
A difficult conversation, "after which we fell in love"
Trump joked about criticism in the news for comments that some people think were “unworthy of the president” and for being too positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his mocking "news anchor voice":
“I have not given up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly Saturday that North Korea did not see a "correct response" to North Korea's initial disarmament moves.
He said the United States would continue to impose restrictions.
Trump’s speech was much more encouraging.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Everything is going very well between us.”
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought good results: missile tests had been stopped, hostage release had been helped, and the repatriation of the remains of American servicemen had been arranged.
He also defended his unusual interactions with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be President, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside to get into this stuffed-up stadium, it’s better to have close to 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy Indonesian island, killing hundreds
In eliminating the effects of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than ten percent of Lombok's population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared as a precondition for receiving international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they don't want international aid, so things are a bit complicated," Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners will be able to work in the area.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palus in order to decide whether international authorities would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly unprepared to deal with natural forces.
Although shelters from tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are not very common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued for the tsunami, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palus increased the number of likely fatalities.
Traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is also quite challenging at the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which stopped in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new site.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia’s infrastructure improvements a central part of his election campaign and has allocated money for roads and railways.
Budget deficits, however, threaten Mr Joko's government, as new elections are to be held next year.
Mr Joko is also being pressured by tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to a more old-fashioned form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes due to fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League, tying the position in the 89th minute of play at Stamford Bridge, London in a Saturday game.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir, being about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal when his team led 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting it towards the far pole.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the top right corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get the position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are passing the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win as much time as I could for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, I made one touch and I struck him without thinking.”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1–0 thanks to a goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute of play.
In this match, the Blues' striker bowled the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before turning over on the midfielder and plunging into the Liverpool side.
Kovacic gave the midfielder a quick pass.
He then created a beautiful air raid, leading Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard got through the defence and kicked the ball into the net towards a post away from Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in a UEFA Euroleague match on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's death toll from the earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
A number of people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
With over 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man after stabbing woman to death
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling to contact people in the area who may have seen or heard something.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is only just beginning, but I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us and hear or see anything suspicious.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, whose onboard cameras may have recorded something, to contact us as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, the woman's alleged friends came to the scene, asking questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is ongoing, and police said they are currently reporting the matter to close relatives of the woman.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but police told him that no one could enter or exit the house.
The man was stunned to hear about the incident.
Residents were told it could take hours to get back into the house.
A police official reportedly told one man that the entire area would now be treated as a crime scene.
One woman was in tears at the scene.
He kept saying, “That’s terrible.”
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still closed in the area, and a third immediately adjacent to it.
A number of police officers stood in the area and monitored the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the event will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 using the September 30th sign.
Parliament's Cromwell statue is the latest memorial to be the cause of the "history rewrite" controversy
Removing it would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts that the man's inhumane pious followers did.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as foolishness and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of the statues, it was impossible for the memorial in front of Oliver Cromwell's Palace in Westminster to remain intact.
Cromwell did not loot the pictures himself during the English Civil War, nor did he order others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the deeds of the man's ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is proof of a 19th-century opinion and part of the history of the person to whom, in the opinion of a number of people, tribute should still be paid."
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people viewed Cromwell’s Parliament as the protector of outside pressure rather than today, and in this case, of course, of kingship.
Whether this is an accurate representation is a never-ending historical controversy.
What is certain is that the controversy of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
The killer killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a farmer in southwest China was attacked by a pig that killed him.
The man, who was identified only as Yuan, was found dead with an injured artery and covered in blood near a pig farm in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China's newspaper Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pigkeeper was preparing to vaccinate pigs in his barn in Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, he and his cousin had come from neighboring Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the nearby pig feather was open.
He said there was a big hog with a bloody mouth in a pig's belly.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the 249.47 kg hog had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were completely bloody and bruised,” Wu told the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 04:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police gather evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly discussing paying compensation for the man's death.
Although rare, it has been previously observed that pigs attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm. A man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294.83 kilograms nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
When a farmer in Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs don’t usually attack, but because of the taste of the blood, they can be baffled.
“They’re just games.
They're very curious maracrats who don't want to get hurt.
They just need to be respected,” the man said.
Hurricane Rosa's Afterwinds Bring Extensive Rainfall to the Southwest
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it moves across Mexico's northern coast toward cooler waters.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday morning, Rosa was classified as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 136.78 kilometres per hour, located 619.59 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, heading east toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it is beginning to shift deep tropical moisture toward the southwest of the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25.4 centimeters.
Then, in the coming days, the approaching low-pressure-responsive tropical humidity in the south-west of the country will produce large-scale heavy rains.
At times, rains of between 2.54 and 10.16 centimetres cause dangerous flash floods, floodwaters, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes precipitation to increase from five to about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in the southern Nevada and Arizona areas.
Rainfall of 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters is also expected in certain areas of the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to the dispersion of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
You should definitely not walk in the desert when there is a risk of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to turn into fast-flowing rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by gusts of wind and volatile dust.
The approaching low-pressure zone will at times result in heavy rains along the southern California coast.
A total rainfall of over 1.27 centimetres is possible and may result in smaller floodwaters and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rainstorms begin approaching Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, with widespread rainfall on Monday night and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and remain until Wednesday.
In October, major temperature fluctuations are predicted in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, while temperatures in tropical areas remain high.
Sometimes this results in large temperature changes in small areas.
The weather on Sunday represents an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), reach almost 20 degrees Celsius.
Over the next few days, they will try again to collect the long summer heat.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to warm early October with temperatures around 80 degrees Celsius, from the southern plains to the north-east.
New York City is expected to reach 26.6 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is around 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that there is a likelihood of high average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched confessions Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his wife Christine Blasey Ford, who allegedly accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political deadlock continued in which broadcasters suspended regular broadcasts to reflect Friday's last-minute twists: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drafted a deal with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain Kavanaugh had grabbed her drunk and tried to rip her clothes off at the high school graduation party.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that it was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
According to a Nielsen report, more than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast on Friday.
The company calculated an average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other channels showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also tends to have problems calculating the number of people who view transfers in authorities.
In comparison, it’s about the same size as the football finals or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel's opinion leaders, who have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a full-day session, Nielsen said.
ABC with 3.26 million viewers came in second place.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
There was also a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was a central character in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught the man Friday morning after he was subjected to a mob attack by protesters while attempting to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for several minutes when he was accused and was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his department had issued a statement and added before the elevator closed that he had more to say at the Justice Committee hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks covered the live broadcast several hours later, when the Legal Affairs Committee had to vote to send Kavanaugh's nomination on to the Senate assembly for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, which have been called for by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by a conversation with fellow Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and the other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an impact as it was obvious that the Republicans would not get Kavanaugh's votes together without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of 'political game'
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the prime minister accused those criticising his plans to leave the European Union of playing a "political game" with Britain's future and harming the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with a newspaper cover of Theresa May with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson put pressure on May's attack on her so-called Brexit agenda, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should levy each other's tariffs is "completely brainless".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of murder of LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of fatally shooting 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them, according to CBS-owned television station WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said the man confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer said his bail was set at $350,000 ($308,600.30).
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday, according to which a gunshot wound to the head in the neck area caused the death.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Operations Team, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, Southern University Police, and people living in the area for their help in the investigation that resulted in the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement agencies in the area for "getting care and justice on its feet".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-meter man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
His average for the previous season's games was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team had been "hit" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“It’s something you’re always worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts over Mexico City
Ash from a volcano called Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost parts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, as activities began again in the crater, resulting in 183 cases of gas emissions and ash gushing within 24 hours.
The center was buzzing with a number of rumblings and tremors.
The images shared on social media depicted the windshields of an ash-covered car in various parts of Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined anti-Catalan protests to mark Catalonia's opposing vote on withdrawal.
A group of militants in favour of masked separation, held back by riot police, attacked the latter with eggs and powder paint, creating thick dust clouds on the streets, usually crowded with tourists.
The attacks also occurred later, when police had to use clubs to control the fighting.
For several hours, supporters of “No Forgetting, No Forgiveness” clashed with pro-state unity protesters chanting “Long Live Spain!”
According to the local press, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the demonstrations.
Tensions continue to mount in the pro-independence region a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but was still celebrated by pro-secession Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although turnout was low as those opposed to the withdrawal grossly ignored the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year as police tried to block the vote in front of polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Independence supporters had spent the night in front of polling stations on Friday night to avoid demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations, however, took place, but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a pro-secession demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of seeing Catalonia as independent.
“Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for joy over the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the regional elections last December, it has been difficult for the parties supporting Catalan independence to maintain their will this year, as a number of the best-known leaders have either gone into exile or have been detained and are awaiting trial for their part in holding the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who uses her mobile phone to record the demonstration to support police, said the controversy was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since last year, announced that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
“Candidate for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the erosion of democratic values and the pressure exerted by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested for ramming house with car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being hit repeatedly by a car in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 British time.
Detective detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
The car could also be driven by an arrow at some point.
Menga's batting gives Livingston a 1–0 win in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The promoted Livingston rallied the Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games while the man has been manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive when Gary Holt lifted the level to Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard will not win in the first league this season and will face the leading Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euroleague.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded their undefeated attack to seven games while head coach Holt still felt the taste of loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses a chance against blunt visitors
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal was scored, as their straightforward playing style caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts waned in front of the goal, with Alan Lithgow making an effort to hit Craig Halkett's headshot over the goal.
The hosts calmly let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for guests in certain places.
And this is also the way in which the deciding goal was scored.
Rangers gave up the free kick and Livingston got a chance to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded from the centre of the penalty area.
By this time, the Rangers were mainly in possession of the ball but were unable to penetrate the defense, making goalkeeper Liam Kelly's side all mainly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the goal on one occasion.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor knocked out Scott Pittman and Lithgow shined brightly in Livingston's next team effort.
The shots reached Livingston's penalty area continuously and were kicked out of it, as well as two penalty kicks, one for trying to replace Halkett's Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was excellent, surpassing expectations when moving up the ladder.
Their playing style and players have hardly changed since returning to the top, but Holt has to be paid tribute for the way he has hardened the team since arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, organizing a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their hind legs throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Despite their intermediate status under Gerrard's leadership, this was not enough, according to local examples.
Their last possession of the ball turned out to be incomplete: the home side only made it once, which could act as an alarm bell for Rangers in the center of the table.
Erdogan's controversial reception in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), Berlin had both smiles and clouds of worry as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been sidelined on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police alluded to security by banning a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters showed up near it to see its president.
Hundreds of people opposed Erdogan, many of whom are Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to host the Turkish president in their own country.
The fighting demonstrations show a split attitude towards the guest: some Turks in Germany hail him as a hero, while others despise him as a self-governing man.
Car Accident on Deptford Road: Pedestrian Killed in Car Crash
A motorcyclist has been killed in London.
The collision occurred on a busy road near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city around 10:15 a.m. British daylight saving time.
The driver of the car stopped and assistance arrived to provide ambulances, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision nearly two kilometres from the Saturday crash site on Childers Street, where the driver who hit the cyclist fled the scene.
London police said authorities were working to identify the man and inform those close to him.
Traffic is closed at the scene and buses are diverted, motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prison Officials Injured in Riots
The prison authority reported that six prison officials were injured in riots at a highly secured men's prison.
The unrest broke out at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 British daylight saving time and is not yet over.
In order to deal with the unrest concentrated in one wing, which involves eight prisoners, expert riot police are involved.
Prison officials were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been called in to solve an ongoing case at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible will be handed over to the police and their prison sentence may be extended."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison driver had been taken to hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were summoned to the prison to quell serious riots that targeted prison officials with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (a hurricane may be good for drought areas)
Arizona is not often hit by tropical lows, but this is likely to happen early next week as hurricane Rosa moves across the desert in the southwest of the United States, posing a threat of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already conducted flash flood monitoring on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, California, and southeastern Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area as early as Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure levels within a radius of 321.86 kilometers from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters of rainfall, which can reach up to 15.24 centimeters in limited areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other desert regions of the U.S. southeastern, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, rainfall is likely to range from 2.54 to 5.08 centimeters, reaching up to 10.16 centimeters in limited areas.
Rosa’s rainfall can be a blessing to areas that are prone to sudden flooding, as the area is experiencing drought.
Although floods are of great concern, such rainfall is also likely to be beneficial due to drought in southwestern America.
According to the US drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is in extreme category two drought, Weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa crosses the Baja California Peninsula on the Mexican mainland.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning was still at hurricane level with the highest winds of 6.43 kilometers per hour, is now 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 kilometers per hour to the north.
The storm comes into contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean, and as a result, it subsides slightly.
Rosa is therefore expected to reach the Mexican mainland with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The amount of precipitation in certain areas of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, rainfalls of between 7.62 and 15.24 centimeters can be expected, occasionally reaching up to 25.4 centimeters,” wrote Weather.com.
Rosa then heads north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low-lying region that crosses Arizona and reaches southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main threat following Rosa or its sequels is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
These torrential rains can cause life-threatening flash floods and floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests linked to attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of premeditated murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 British daylight saving time.
The victim was taken to a “stable” hospital.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have cell phone recordings of the incident.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered” from the Democratic Party’s “neglect and hatred”.
“Supporting Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a cheering speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered" under the Democratic Party's "sneer and anger" during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, fiercely and emotionally rejecting accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that she was assaulted by a man decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "America saw the glory, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day."
The vote given for Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote to appoint one of the most respected law examiners of our time, with an impeccable background in public service," he told a supportive crowd in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment, while talking about the importance of the republic's voter turnout in the midterm elections.
“There are five weeks left to choose one of the most important in our lifetime.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate," he said.
“So I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump claimed the Democrats were on a mission to “stand up and prevent.”
The first main procedural vote on the Senate floor for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, senior Republican party deputy chiefs told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away as tsunamis hit the beach after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when six-metre waves hit the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything on the way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, people were still doing their thing on the beach, not fleeing immediately, thus becoming victims," Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency BNPB, told a press conference in Nugroho Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it took cars, logs and houses with it, wiping everything off the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving offshore at a speed of 800 km per hour before it reached shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 centre.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and mosques surrounded by water.
The aftershocks in the coastal town also continued on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a wave of earthquakes was felt.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Evaluation and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's strong earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than that of a nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located on a long and narrow bay, may have increased the strength of the tsunami, BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher in a coastal area 300 km north of Palu called Donggala, which was closer to the center of the earthquake.
The reports from Donggala “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information,” Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 residents in the region,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its team and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy that could get worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami in the city of Palu, although authorities said the waves reached the beach at the same time as the warning was issued.
Amateur footage on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building warning people on the street below of an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the accuracy of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large-scale power outage that hampered communications in the Palu area and made it difficult for authorities to carry out rescue work.
The military has begun deploying transport planes to provide assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic supplies.
The airport in the city was re-opened for rescue work, remaining closed for the rest of October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
This is really bad.
Although World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they are sheltered in the presenter tents set up in their office courtyard, they saw crippling sights on their way, Mr. Dosheba said.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
This is really bad.
Although the relief forces vigorously began operations to mitigate the disaster, some complained that workers from highly experienced foreign aid organizations were prevented from traveling to Palus.
Under Indonesian rules, foreign funding, supplies, and reinforcements can only be sent if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can start accepting international aid, but that's not yet announced."
When the second night came in Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of the missing were still full of hope that their loved ones would be the wonderful cases that ease the gloom of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Indonesia national slide parachute team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing slide parachuters for the Asian Games held in Indonesia earlier this month.
The rest who are trapped in the Roa Roa hotel are his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“As a senior slider, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon spoke about how, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the community of glider paratroopers, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with just one grey bird instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages didn’t arrive,” he said.
Thieves took €23,585.88 during ATM execution at Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, thieves stole €23,585.88 from a Brink employee performing an ATM at Newport on the Levees, a press release from the Newport Police Department said.
The driver emptied an ATM machine at an entertainment facility and was preparing to bring in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
When the man acted, “another man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag full of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, writes a press release, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on theft will be asked to contact Newport Police by phone at (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper takes his new name Ye
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
When announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Former Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her concert "on the impulse of feelings", the author said.
In addition to being the abbreviation of the man's current present name, West has previously stated that it is a word of religious significance to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is one of the most widely used words in the Bible, which means ‘you’,” West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, it is us, it is us.
I changed my name from Kanye, which means “this one,” to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion, and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye West isn't the only rapper to play by his name.
Sean Combs is known primarily under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also used its name with and without a dash, in uppercase and lowercase letters.
Mexican politician vows not to use military against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use an army against civilians.
Lopez Obrador vowed Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use an army to restrain the Mexicans.”
The army attacked a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people as leftist student movements were gaining ground throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding of artificial intelligence.
“As China becomes more and more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount allocated to research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and artificial intelligence researcher who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were released after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. has no formal strategy on artificial intelligence in general.
At the same time, China last year outlined its plan to be a player in the renewal of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the U.S. and we are working on the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funding would double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded Face++, one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the best American Othello player. Later, he was on the board of directors of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be held to help identify the next dreamers.
"U.S. scientists need to work hard to get funding from the government," Lee said.
“China isn’t the one taking over from the intellectuals, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said the changes to immigration policy could help support the U.S. artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think that people who have obtained a doctorate in artificial intelligence should be offered a green card automatically,” he said.
The Chinese Council of State published the next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
"China's National Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Unified Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve partners from industry and educational institutions, while the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced it was funding a $2 million AI Next initiative.
But the National Science Foundation is currently funding more than $100 million a year in AI-related research.
At the same time, there has been no change in US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country’s name
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would also settle a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from confirming its membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims its northern neighbor’s name is a requirement for its territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries agreed in June on a new name for Macedonia, but nationalist opponents say the name would harm the national identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum, and the campaign has raised doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the 50% turnout required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum asks, “Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to ensure Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, joins organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protective arm of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it determinative.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required for a name change.
The National Electoral Committee said there were no reports of irregularities as of 13:00.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Macedonia’s capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their vote in a referendum on Macedonia's name change, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising chairs in front of tents for those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the servants’ door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not wish to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and gain from European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority supports the name change as more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of membership of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said the “yes” would be “proof of our future.”
The results of a poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies revealed that 30 to 43 percent of voters are planning to take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
A poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government's Western policy since the government took over leadership in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defence for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling stormed through Brighton's defence, securing Manchester City's 2–0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like his 65th minute goal came off ridiculously easily.
The Argentine striker passed at the start of the midfield sequence.
He was penetrated by three Brighton defenders before reaching the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He penetrated another defender before running past several players at the Brighton penalty area border.
He then kicked the ball to his left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used the first kick to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to kick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his legs," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“He played for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that point."
However, Sterling was the one to give the Sky Blues an initial head start in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton territory.
He sent the ball beautifully to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane hit the ball a few times before leading Sterling further.
The Sky Blues kicked the ball forward into the net just before it slipped out of bounds.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. at Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the spoiler against the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the tournament, there was no reason to start again.
Scherzer hopes to tear down the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers in one game at the NL West, still have a chance to make it to the finals.
The Rockies secured at least a Joker spot on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but the team still wants to secure its first division position.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least give it a try, knowing that playing in Denver with the audience and the other team is probably at a higher level than any other game I’m expected to play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete here?"
The Nationals have yet to name the opening player on Sunday, but are reportedly leaning toward Scherzer's pass in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th pitching, made a warm-up session on Thursday and fed the usual on Sunday.
This Washington right-handed player leads 18 to 7, with an ERA of 2.53, outscores of 300 and favorable chances of his 220 2/3 this season.
Trump to hold a rally in West Virginia
The president implicitly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
It's a big event that I'm not running for, but I'm actually running for, and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: “You see this terrible, extremely terrible group of extremist Democrats, you see this happening before your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power by any means. You can see their meanness and dirty game.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to outrun for power and control, all they want is power and control over everything, and we're not giving it to them."
Democrats are on a mission to “stand up and prevent.”
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, mean and deceitful."
He was referring by name to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was shouted down loud in the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak that document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, wait, that was one of the worst examples of body language, actually the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a major party.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When activists from my local party Momentum voted to condemn me, it was not very surprising.
After all, I am the last on the list of Labour MEPs to be told that you are not welcome, all for expressing your opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she was strongly anti-Jewish.
In my case, I was criticized by the judges for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, my eight-year experience as a local Labour MP with the general assembly on Friday evenings is exactly that.
Unfortunately, as of today, this is no longer the case for most meetings, and the promise to be "kinder and more generous" in politics has long since been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different perspectives are not acceptable in the Labour Party, and who is acceptable to the party leadership is judged for each opinion.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and the co-worker with whom I thought I shared similar political views in the past now expected me to change my mind and accept positions I would never have otherwise accepted, whether they were matters of national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I appear in public somewhere, no matter what I actually say, it is followed by condemnation on social media, urging my recall, ignoring party policies, and saying that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my co-workers because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and judgment of those collaborators who face daily sexist or racist abuse but never give up.
One of the most disappointing views in this policy area is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer such a large association, and by any initiative of "unbelief" or by changing the election rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have been advised a lot to keep my head down, to talk less, and “then everything would be fine.”
But that’s not what I came here to do in politics.
From the moment I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had left my large school classroom literally on the brink of collapse, I have tried to speak out for better public services for those who need it most, acting both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
It is by no means possible that anyone in Nottingham East became confused about my political views or areas of disagreement with the local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that as the country is on the move towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my adherents, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of resignation or political consideration will stop me from acting for what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 – Melrose: Invincible Ayr moves to the top
The two late events may have tilted the final score somewhat, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully fun first league game with Tennent.
They are now the only unbeaten team in the top ten of the table.
In the end, it was the team's high level of protection and better risk-taking that led to the home team's victory and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested all the time during the games and we’re still invincible, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “I’m telling a story about Ayr, they used their opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, taken by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a head start, but the yellow card given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was relegated by the Warriors for the game, gave Melros a chance, with Jason Baggot making a failed try.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the end of halftime, achieving a standing of 17 to 5 in Ayr's favour by the end of halftime with the single-event.
But Melrose started the second half successfully, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, taken over by Baggot, narrowed the gap by five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken away on a stretcher. As the game continued, Ayr increased the lead further thanks to an attempt by Stafford McDowall, passed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, but again paid for the failed transmission of Melrose player Bruce Colvine's attempt after heavy pressure.
However, the team playing at home fielded strength again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing Climo without a ball on the penalty kick line, MacPherson put the ball down behind the advancing Ayers.
Climo passed the ball on, as he did almost immediately after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box kick and sent side defense Gregor Henry away on the fifth attempt of the team playing at home field.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that the man was named director of a renowned restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a well-known BBC television series he writes and stars in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphilli.
The couple have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final one in the series, and it appears that Kiernan is making new plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan would like to enter the Glasgow "blooming restaurant business".
'The Sea Is Ours': Sea-bound Bolivia Hopes Court Will Open Its Way Again to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags are flying over the buildings of the authority.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the slogan is: “The sea is our right.
It is our responsibility to restore it."
The memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive in Bolivia, and the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean is equally vivid.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling by an international court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and the country naturally expects a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A number of Bolivians from all over the country are looking at the decision of the international court from the big screens, in the hope that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia, after which Chile, after decades of intermittent discussions, will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia to give the latter an independent route to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is at stake with Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to vote in favour of Bolivia, or if so, it would change very little.
The United Nations in the Netherlands does not have the power to give up Chilean territory, and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the international court’s ruling comes just six months after hearing the final statements suggests that it was not a “difficult case,” said Paz Zárate, an international law expert in Chile.
And by moving away from additional causes in Bolivia, the last four years may have exacerbated the situation.
“The problem of access to the sea has been abducted by the current Bolivian authorities,” Zárate said.
Morales' militant eloquence has lost all remaining Chilean benevolence, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all this, the debate will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unnecessarily swift.
Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in its relationship with Chile” and “end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's best-known presidents, was using the issue of the sea to express political resentment.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
“The decision is the opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no denuclearization until it can trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first unless they could trust Washington.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made to each other by rival national leaders during the Singapore Summit.
He is commenting on the matter at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to be restarting his impasse on nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, these are air castles, thinking that the US' continued restrictions and refusal to declare war on Korea will cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington will be wary of such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its weapons, which it sees as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows bring to the viewer a series of massive headgear brought to shoppers on the shopping streets in their neighborhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of bizarre ultra-large headgear to the stage as part of their 2019 summer season, blinding Paris Fashion Week.
High and impractical hats are in fashion this summer via Instagram, and these designers have sent their stunning creations to the runways.
Valentino’s masterpiece was an overlaid beige hat covering the heads of the models, decorated with a wide border resembling feathers.
Other items of clothing included watermelons adorned with jewels, a wizard hat, and even a pineapple, but their purpose is not to insulate the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, doing it just in time for Halloween.
Much of the coloured masks had mouths sewn together, so that they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than the high fashion.
One part of the creation resembled a diving suit with an air tube and glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with the giant fad, you're in luck.
Fashion gurus predict that extra-large headgear may also reach the shopping streets nearby.
The ultra-large hats follow the trail of La Bomba, a straw hat 60 centimetres wide that has been seen in the heads of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created a largely impractical hat, sent another great work to the runways – a straw beach bag almost as big as the bikini model wearing it.
The dark orange raffia bag with its raffia fringes and white leather shank was the highlight of Jacquemus's La Riviera summer collection at Paris Fashion Week 2019.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags on the shopping streets next summer. Because the designer has made such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for extra-large clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important for global citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the academic excellence rankings and this continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and joint success in sport, arts, music and other community activities.
Schools with a total of over 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council for Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that is able to design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we can see that modern languages continue to be a well-known and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s fresh exam results, we can see that the languages at the top of the tables are the ones with the highest rate of passing exams among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools shows that 72 percent of students received an A in Mandarin, 72 percent of German, 69 percent of French, and 63 percent of Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as vital life skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages that are now among the subject choices in private schools and other school curricula are the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of respondents cited a lack of language skills among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find workers for job vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future jobs.
As more promising job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming indispensable in a globalising world.
Regardless of the career choice made, acquiring a second language will give a person a real advantage in the future, since the language skills are lifelong.
Being able to communicate directly with foreign citizens gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
According to a survey by YouGov conducted by more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation about it. The only language with a double-digit percentage of speakers was French with 15 percent.
Therefore, the financing of language learning is important for today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of emerging economies, gives children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at each school.
A number of schools focus more on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages considered the most important in the UK in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, private schools always have the possibility to choose between several languages, which are taught by experts in their field.
Scottish Private Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
It can no longer be denied that, in a globalised business environment, languages are crucial to a country's future, which is why this must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be considered as “international communication skills”.
Private schools continue to offer choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Board of Private Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Zealous admirers no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of games still needs to be determined.
“It’s over one and under 48,” Walton told the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a number of minutes.
After training last week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game preseason schedule for the Lakers.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to warm myself up," he said.
Trump West Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his election campaign series tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump’s first campaign event in five planned for next week, including stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote will stand until Trump chooses who to appoint to the Supreme Court vacancy, he will seek to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress following the November vote.
What time is Trump's campaign event in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday night, September 29, 2018 at 19:00 East Coast time.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to speak to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh about this week's hearings that became tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while a Senate confirmation vote is suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the matter.
But the main goal of the campaign series is to help gather new momentum for Republicans facing tough elections in November.
So President Trump’s campaign manager said the goal of the five events next week is to “incite volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their Senate and House majority.”
“Controlling Congress is so important to the president’s agenda that Trump is going to be diving into as many states as possible during the fast election campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's campaign event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage in the Pittsburgh media," the West Virginia Metro News reported.
This is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Sen. Patrick Morrisey, who leads the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to boost his performance,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team has enough nerve to compete, keeping hopes high ahead of Sunday’s singles match
After three one-sided sessions, the games held on Saturday afternoons were perhaps just what the Ryder Cup needed.
Fluctuating pivot pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sports, but players truly believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do they think the turning point is now?
“They led by six points, which has now become four, so I think that might be a bit of a turning point,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, that is clear, because it is led by four points and there are still 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel they don't have enough wind in their sails, but they do have a lot of encouragement, especially in Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four.
Spieth has been astounding in both tee and grin and is setting an example.
The shouts of victory from the throat grew louder and louder with each round, overshadowing the deciding put, which would have brought the fourth match to a draw after he and Thomas were down by two.
His putt, which won the match on the 15th, sent a similar cry that showed the man's belief that the Americans were not yet out of the race.
“You just have to focus and worry about your fight,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players can do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are the undisputed stars of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but beloved couple has four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, also avoiding bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game, and the way their energy flows into and out of the noisy crowds, reinforces the belief that the players they compete with on Sunday, and that when the sun sets across the Le Golf National, there is no better-known player than Fleetwood or Molinari to confirm a possible European victory.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the stories of Europe's glory are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, when the man was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the first nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
Four-balls and doubles are very attractive to watch closely because of the communication between the couples, the advice given to each other, the advice they have not received and how the way can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a strong lead by the last day, but this session of the Quartets showed that the US team has the nerve to fight, which some, especially the Americans, have questioned.
Europe will lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe takes a good lead, taking a 10-6 lead over the United States after Saturday’s four-ball and doubles games.
The great duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the struggling Tiger Woods with two wins to raise their score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who contributed to the preservation of the cup lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side in the morning four-ball, winning the series 3–1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in doubles, winning two games, but these failed to make up for the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points to maintain the cup from Sunday's 12 singles.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who is called Molliwood after this tumultuous weekend, they are the second pair to have won four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
Having destroyed Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeauveel more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed an occasional shine, but by now lost 29 of his four-ball and doubles games to 19, receiving seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested for four balls in the morning, returned to doubles with partner Henrik Stenson, winning 2–1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held in pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Saturday.
They scored a solid four-ball victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and defeating Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in doubles, after losing two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team returned from a four-point deficit, going into singles, though as owners, Furyki's side only needs a draw to maintain the cup.
Although being the second best for two days, after the Sunday counterattack, it seems that they will not succeed.
North Korea says they won’t disarm unilaterally because of lack of trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued restrictions deepened their distrust of the United States and that the country did not intend to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken "considerable goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and making a pledge not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see the U.S. responding to that,” he said.
“Without trusting the United States, our country has no security, and under these circumstances, we are not in any way willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s resistance to the “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, which would reward North Korea if it took gradual steps, his statement felt it was important that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to move towards a "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international restrictions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on giving up nuclear weapons first and increases the pressure of the restrictions to achieve their goal forcibly, even opposing the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“The notion that the restrictions will bring us to our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the ongoing restrictions are exacerbating our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for Kim and Trump's second summit, which the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea, not the United States, were one of the parties to the nuclear issue, the nuclear disarmament issue on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this impasse.”
However, Ri’s remarks differed sharply from last year’s when she told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile approach to the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea completely, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but added there was still much to be done and that the restrictions must remain in place until North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he lacked a schedule, saying "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's restrictions must continue to be enforced vigorously and without fail until we can fully and definitively confirm the denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased restrictions on North Korea in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Riga alongside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although his last trip was not a good one.
After meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him for "gangster-like demands" within a few hours.
North Korea pledged to dismantle missiles and the nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that by “appropriate measures,” he meant Trump’s promised security guarantees in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University is offering a new course where students need to sleep more to combat the growing aggressive culture of learning through high-caffeinated, night-long learning marathons.
Students who love the academics of the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to the basics of taking care of yourself.
According to Charles Czeisler, a sleeper at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, this is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired by the creation of the course after giving a speech on how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now, in my last year of school?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - it really baffled me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first included in the curriculum this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as helping to improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health at the university, said the university decided to take a course on the curriculum after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during the work week.
The hour-long course covers a number of interacting tasks.
One section presents a picture of the dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books, and explain the effects of caffeine and light on how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance and the importance of bedtime habits.
The second section explains to participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with its interacting symbols encourages participants to reflect on their daily established practice.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of cigarette smoking," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, there is still a sense of pride about night marathons, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is still a growing problem.
“Ensuring enough quality sleep should be a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he added.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to contribute to the creation of a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised the students to set an alarm for both going to bed and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” produced by electronic screens and LED lighting, as this can damage their circadian rhythm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest game result when a Dolly Menga kick, sent off by side Steven Gerrard, brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
The Ibrox side had hoped to score their first guest win since February, when St Johnstone were defeated 4-1, but Gary Holt's team caused only Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a manager, falling eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership manager Hearts.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before halftime, and Rangers' poor readiness was never able to recover from it.
Rangers thus fall to sixth place, with Livingston rising to third place, staying behind Hibernian with just one goal.
For Rangers, the troubles may not have ended because their attacker Calum Spence needed treatment for a head wound after he was hit by an apparently discarded object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side, leading past Ayr and Betfred Cup to the semi-finals.
Holt, however, went ahead at the same time with the same Livi 11 who took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been happy with the way his well-trained boys smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have been more dominant in the village, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored in the second opening minute when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder didn't take his chance.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but its defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide arc kick to the rear pole.
The Rangers did gain control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the final third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt strongly that he should have been hit by a penalty kick when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of play, referee Steven Thomson did not satisfy the Columbia player's complaint.
Rangers managed to make just two hits to the target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned about either Lassana Coulibaly's header or Ovie Ejaria's event.
Although Liv's 34th minute kickoff may have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to contain Jacobs' deep hard performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher kicked the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and selected Menga to lead the plan just to the end.
Gerrard acted on the break, trading Coulibaly Ryan for Kent, which almost paid off when the winger split Morelos, but the impressive Kelly swerved to take the lead.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game that suits them, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up long balls.
Holt's side could have advanced their lead at the final stage, but McGregor stood firm, thwarting Jacobs before Lithgow struck from the corner with a large arc.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again applied for a penalty kick when he fouled Jacobs, which Thomson once again failed to satisfy.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and READING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From this science foundation, the Geiger counter also became the foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado Watches, starring the seemingly improbable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
By wearing these headphones, it is possible to hear the sound of atoms emitted from the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: “Don’t tell me, it’s still going on!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to 'See' Cheating Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Scamster Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know the swindler cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing these cells in the laboratory
They are then able to "see" a common protein for many cancers and are injected back
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine to detect swindler cells lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein that has spread to various HER2 cancers, and then these cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “leads the growth of many cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, in which patients are taken from immune cells and trained to target cancer cells, has been used in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West started out as a pro-Trump tribe by wearing a MAGA hat on SNL’s live show.
It didn't go so well.
In Saturday Night Live, a disparaging whistling chorus echoed towards Kanye West, following his confusingly delivered speech praising U.S. President Donald Trump and announcing his candidacy for the same position in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat labeled Make America Great, he started yelling at Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so much to white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I was so worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the arrangement with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood celebrity made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual assault.
Although this episode did not air, West's racket footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock attempted to mock West with the post.
West also complained to the audience that he had been having a pretty hard time behind the scenes regarding his hat.
“They teased me backstage.
They told me not to go in there with a hat on.
They made fun of me!
And then they say I'm drowned in the place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see the sunken place? I’m going to put on my Superman cape because it means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments triggered outrage from viewers on at least two occasions, and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. According to Variety, one person revealed: “The entire studio remained dead quiet.”
West had been brought in at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande because her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the song “I Love It”, which he looked like a bottle of Perrier’s.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one bold soul: THANK YOU FOR BECOME THE COURT MASS.”
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was “just who he is, and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I chose NOT to reward (by buying my own music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) someone who I believe believes and spreads a worldview that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now “former Kanye West.”
She is not the first singer to change her stage name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg is also known as Snoop Lion and, of course, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol.
Attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast's east side on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones celebrity Kit Harington disapproves of fanfare for masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-flashing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the actor (31) disparages the stereotype of the aggressive hero, saying that such roles on screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit felt that “something had gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve a fanciful problem of masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, admitted to feeling “quite strongly” that the problem needs attention.
“I personally feel pretty strongly now that we’ve gone wrong with masculinity somewhere,” he said.
“What have we taught men when they grow up about the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television is partly to blame for the upsurge in masculinity, as super-manlike characters are shown there.
He continued: “What is innate and what is being taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be just like that if they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
“Something has gone wrong for the kids.”
In the poll, he also admitted that after the series ended the following summer, he would never participate in any sequel to Game of Thrones, saying he was "on one side with his battlefields and horses".
Beginning in November, Kit Sam Shepard is involved in a revival of True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his brother-in-law.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing related to Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” she said.
Rose starred in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the beloved of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has soared to 14%.
According to health professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases have arisen from having sex, thus changing the past.
Natively, HIV was transmitted through infected blood transfusions in some parts of China.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is said to be high.
Studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of diseases are associated with insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to use universal access to HIV drugs to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking GOP senator's data, saying they are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that her employee had posted personal details of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has confirmed that such claims are spread by "ultra-right" trolls and their websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Utah).
The information appeared online Thursday. It had been posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing regarding sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the post, was linked to the Waters office and released member information for an employee under Waters, Hill said.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a complete and absolute lie," Waters continued.
“My employees, whose personality, personal data and safety are compromised by these fraudulent and false claims, are in no way responsible for this disclosure.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters' statement was quickly reviewed on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial comes from anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he has a feeling that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not become angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They have to stay calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for the seat of Waters in the interim election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Important when it comes to the truth,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned "relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent allegations."
“We will do everything to identify the perpetrators and make them legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again review - underserved Rowan Atkinson spy-parody
It is now common practice to look for the meanings of Brexit in all new British films and this seems particularly appropriate in the Johnny English action comedy parody series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and became a sequel in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn - being revived.
Is it funny to joke about how obviously stupid we are at the country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, punk-eyed rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has been given permission to do things once again in his own clumsy way - and that this broad comic creation is meant for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, this is an undercover agent who, despite his bizarre pretentious smoothie glamour, resembles Clouseau a little, Mr Bean a little, and a little character who set the tone for Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is also based on the traveler and international mystery Atkinson, who was once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving nothing but chaos.
There are only one or two pleasant moments in this latest JE movie.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter when he was wearing a medieval armor and the helicopter's rotors slammed against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and oddly redundant, especially when "serious" spy films such as 007 and Mission Impossible also offer comedies of their own with confidence.
It seems that this humor is meant for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s clever adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent films Beanina.
There is a long-standing assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy web site, revealing the identities of all Britain's secret police officers, thereby causing the on-site agent a huge disappointment - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a prime minister who is a celebratory, struggling character who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does it brilliantly as Teresa-May’s character, but the script doesn’t have much to work on.
His intelligence advisers suggest that since all active spies are compromised, he must recall someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster at a fancy establishment, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is flown back to Whitehall for emergency briefing and is reunited with his former longtime partner, Bough, who is played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the stigmas of Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, in places Olga Kurõlenko played by the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the thumb of a dangerously charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve all of Britain's computer problems: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their cranky odyssey: hiding as waitresses, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by secretly climbing aboard the Volta luxury yacht; and English launches a genuine mess when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to explore the interior of the Volta house.
No brakes are used in this last section, but as cute and impetuous as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV taste attached to it.
Pretty average stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I caught myself wondering: doesn’t the British film industry really have a role to play for Rowan Atkinson that’s fair to his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan where Britons work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a landmark plan that stipulates that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party wants the company's bosses to pass on the savings they received through the Artificial Intelligence Revolution (AI) to employees, giving them one additional day off.
That would be a three-day weekend for employees - but they would get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would fit into the party's economic agenda, and so the state intends to lean in favour of the workers.
Thursday's work week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress so workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that the review of the bill will be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day work week is an effort that fits in with the party’s approach to balancing the economy, both for the benefit of the workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Greens also promised a Thursday working week during their 2017 election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole does not currently support the effort.
A Labour spokesman said: “Thursday’s work week is not a party policy and it will not be discussed.”
Undersecretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to fine-tune his vision of a socialist turn in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take back power from "faceless executives" and "earners of profit".
The Deputy Secretary General’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get back their entire shareholding, as the Labour Party could make “deductions” in connection with a perceived misdemeanor.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to provide 10% of private equity to employees instead of giving annual bonuses of up to €561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes about whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination by at least one week and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could affect the end of support for Republican senators.
In a poll on Sunday, Scott Pelley, co-host of 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I was going to be interrogated. I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was decisive, firm and unequivocal."
Graham's voice seems to be rock solid.
"I am confident in my decision with respect to Brett Kavanaugh, and that could only be changed by a bombshell," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know how this happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it,” Graham said.
“And everyone he named could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the annual music event hosts the New York Global Citizen Festival, with an immensely impressive celebrity engagement and an equally impressive goal: to eradicate poverty from the world.
Now, the seventh edition of the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn area not only enjoying such singers as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness about the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks or volunteer activities, send an email to some of the world's leaders, make a phone call, or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 more years to reach their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way of persuading them to act, or is it just another click-through where people feel like they are doing something important by signing a statement online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "activities" of its supporters, striving to achieve a number of different goals.
These measures have helped global leaders to communicate more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and communications stemming from their operations, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include a UK-based partnership with investors and implementers, The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “help children make the most of their potential” by promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historical footnote to social injustice," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 actions calling for improved maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced a funding project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in need of nutritional intervention.
In response to one FAQ on their website asking, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “It’s a long and hard road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements we face, we are confident in our success because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a couple of performers to perform at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy 'barrier' to block Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington could use its naval force if necessary to avoid hitting the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially if it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the Southern European Pacific,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"This is an opportunity for the United States, with the help of our navy, to ensure that maritime lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he added.
Zinke's statement was addressed to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization representing the "power consumer voice" of the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"Iran and Russia's economic choice is more or less, leverage and fuel replacement," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with increasing exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to reject the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said had made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has been rebuffed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of Industries (BDI) has called on the U.S. to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem for me if a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was seriously considering running for president in the interim election.
At Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his consideration of the nomination.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the First Lady," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6 I am seriously considering running for president."
Warren also gave an assessment of President Donald Trump’s actions at City Hall, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has voiced criticism of Trump and its Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we can vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters do not think he should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" Massachusetts voters thought the senator should not run for office.
32% supported such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, 38% supported a possible nomination, and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump gathering
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with
“What my son is going through, what he’s going to experience when he comes back, I can relate to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are going to be coming back with,” Trump said.
Palin called his son's arrest an "elephant in space" and said in regards to his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there's enough respect for what the soldiers and the airmen and all the other military have given the country."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday, and according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence against a woman, interference in a domestic violence case report, and possession of a gun in a state of intoxication.
18 states and the District of Columbia dispute new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy prohibiting shelter for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts issued a brief statement in Washington on Friday to court friends in support of a challenging policy regarding the asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The applicant's full name in Grace v. Sessions suit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the union's policy, has not been released.
She said her accomplice "and her violent gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries that produce large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, among whom gangs and domestic violence are a major problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 ruling by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence in order to file an asylum application.
Attorney General for the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "will disregard state, Union and international law for decades."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be handled in accordance with certain facts and circumstances, and such a request violates this principle,” the court said in a statement.
Lawyers also argued in a brief statement that banning immigrants from entering harms the U.S. economy, saying they would likely become entrepreneurs and "offer the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June no longer to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"A request for asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear about race, religion, nationality, or a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The shelter was never intended to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious ones - that people face on a daily basis.
Entertaining rescue operations in Palu, where deaths have doubled in fighting to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly threatening.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her fever-stricken baby boy at the evacuation centre in the city of Palu.
“Every minute there are new people coming in the ambulance.
There’s not enough clean water.”
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through the spilled things and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some injured, including a broken back and upper arm, Dwi Haris rested outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated in the field due to strong aftershocks.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a strong earthquake shook her fifth-floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
“I didn’t have time to save myself.
I think I was pressed against the wall in ruins," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger."
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying with bullying ads'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement under U.S. daily news about the mutual daily benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American journalism to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to an addendum paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's largest newspaper in circulation - after China was accused of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election marked what US officials described to Reuters as a new phase in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to make advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other's import tariffs are being adjusted.
China's countermeasures at the start of the tariff war were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa because they supported Trump's Republican party, experts from China and the U.S. have explained.
The U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, as well as China's largest exporter of agricultural products Terry Branstad, said that Beijing harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion piece on Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China has now doubled its bullying by publishing agitation ads in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished freedom of speech and free press practice by putting its paid advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, there are only limited voices in Beijing's street kiosks and no real differences of opinion among the Chinese people about China's worrying economic direction, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he added.
He added that one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans will alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections with a Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
Feelings surrounding the situation have been at the top, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be undone," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Political Science at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher expressed suspicion that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute effort in connection with the FBI investigation was enough to calm angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state representative for MoveOn, Washington, told the Washington DC newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated "November is coming!" at a demonstration in the Senate hallway, as Republicans who control the judges' committee decided to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“The democratic spirit and inner conviction are starting to fall off the charts,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unofficial political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters ages 18 to 29 who dislike the president and often fail to vote."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts predicted a setback if Republicans move forward with the endorsement.
“It’s become very confusing for the GOP,” former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote, it's about the final vote, it's not about whether Kavanaugh is going to be elected, it's about how Republicans have handled it and how they've treated him," said Guy Cecil, president of the U.S. National Priorities.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided, believing in Ford after the testimonies, and Kavanaugh after, but supporting the former a little more.
A new poll by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were sure or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were sure or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before a Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet that will face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds out Berners-Lee’s open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was to "rule the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data library" or POD.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and competent tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all available in one browser at the same time.
What makes this personal online data collection unique is that the user is able to choose who gets access to this information.
The company calls it “bringing personal credentials through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt’s idea is for the company to bring in sources, process, and relevant skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired under contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team won’t talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change if all their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We don’t ask their permission.”
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: World War I memorial stone of a clergyman who had received the Victoria Cross opened
The Church of England, which received its Victoria Cross during World War I, celebrated its 100th anniversary in its home town.
Lieutenant Colonel Rev. Bernard Vann fought out his badge of honor in the September 29, 1918 attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper bullet and did not know that he had received the highest British military honor badge.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone at Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "genially symbolic" if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after the grandfather's award-winning fight.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick mist and bullets of rifles and machine guns."
He later rushed to the offensive line and moved it forward with the "biggest gallantry" before rushing alone to one machine gun and knocking three opponents out.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanni was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, when only a little over a month remained until the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I will never be able to repeat, but for which I will always be grateful."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann placed a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood's coningly young band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be part of this parade" and added that "the presence and support of so many people shows that the true hero is appreciated."
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa the Pig
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching Bellator 206, but you’re not showing it.
The San Jose match featured 13 fights, including six from the main charts, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom throughout the night.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, viewers in the UK were left with their mouths wide open because Peppa the Pig appeared on the screen.
Many were not thrilled by this, especially those who had stayed awake until the early hours to see the very struggle.
A fan described the move to a children’s comic on Twitter as “a sick joke.”
"It's a government regulation that at 6:00 p.m., the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to the children's program," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they plan to work on their schedule to take more account of UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about playback now, I think we can solve this problem in the future," Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
No, it wasn’t, it was government policy.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're showing five instead of six fights - as we usually do - we tried to offer more to the fans, and we just went over the time.
This is a woeful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “undervalued” about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until high school that "everyone's not like him."
While participating in Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs, she said she would talk about gay rights to give hope to others.
Becoming a parent also changed his attitude toward winning the Olympics, giving him the feeling that it was not so important anymore.
Kirsty Young, a regular long-time presenter of the show, had to take a few months off due to her illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt less valued than the others when she grew up because it wasn't socially acceptable if you liked boys and girls.
He said, “Until this day, those feelings of not being worthy and feeling different have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
She wanted to prove that she was “worthy” of something and didn’t disappoint others when they finally found out about her sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympian has become a leader in the highly regarded LGBT campaign, using his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he would talk about it because he is lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others as well.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "hit him by surprise."
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older last year, but he said the age gap had never been a problem.
“If you go through so much when you’re young” – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – then it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole outlook" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not agree to die and one of the last things he asked for was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - as he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you can’t sit in the front row because you’ll be gone by then,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died did I finally admit that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of home crowds at the Olympics, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Heather Small's Proud - which helped her in preparing for the Olympics and still gives her goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 aired on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. BST.
Mickelson removed from Ryder Cup game on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson makes a record Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays a record 12th time in the event every two years, was removed from the game by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's doubles game and four-ball.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been for the U.S., the five-time winner splits his day into two, being a cheerleader and working on his game in hopes of fixing it.
Never the most direct hitter, not even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old is particularly unsuited to play on the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long rough track constantly penalizes stray hits.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday, his ninth match, who has joined forces with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four races this week.
If Americans are four points behind at the start of 12 singles, the Mickelson competition may be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he had little else to add.
“He fully understood his part today, patted me on the shoulder, put his arm around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is a celebrity and he has given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I expected more, but it went like this, and we had to choose this path.
He wants to be outside like everyone else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the most Ryder Cup player.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which, however, has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has made an additional spiritual contribution to the team.
“He’s funny, mocking, funny, he likes to have fun with people and he’s just great in the team room,” she explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week and it was great to see that.
He’s offering more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big head start may soon be lost
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from personal experience that the Ryder Cup's great lead at the start of individual games can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane made his public debut at the 1997 Valderrama competition, where he and Captain Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but this was drastically reduced when they reached the finish line, winning only 14-16: 13-17.
“You even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, this victory came very close,” said Bjorn in the photo, after a Class of 2018 victory of 5:3 on Friday and a 10:6 success yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points.
We have a goal, which is to win the cup, and so we focus on it.
“I’ve always said I’m going to focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of who our opponents are – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I won’t get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow will be an entirely new challenge.
Tomorrow will be a personal event, so it will be different.
It's great to be with an opposing player when things are going well, but if you're there in person, you'll be fully tested as a golfer.
This is the message you need to send to the players - do your best tomorrow.
Now that you’re leaving your partner behind, he’ll have to go and deal with it himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes his players will act better in person than with opposing players except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last few days, being part of the Brookline winning team before becoming part of the defeat as Europe defeated the ‘Medinah Miracle'.
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 encouraged his players to put in all their games on the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start hot, like at Brookline and like at Medina.
When the momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average races.
We will set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel will be a miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the race, and is outmatched by Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter as the other top Europeans in the race.
“I put my boys in this line-up because I think that’s how we’re properly covered,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The German Navy's newest high-speed sailboat should have come into service in 2014, replacing obsolete Cold War-era warships, but it won't be until next year due to faulty systems and increased costs as a snowball, local media reported.
The introduction of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class flagship Rheinland-Pfalz has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military press release published in the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have joined the Navy as early as 2014, but the troubling post-transfer problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 replace the outdated Bremen-class high-speed sailboats.
It is understood that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some cover-up technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared and audible signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest high-speed sails should be able to be sent out of the home port for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that the top-level warships - which promise to strengthen Germany's power abroad - are already becoming obsolete by the time they enter service.
A failed F125 speedboat appeared in the news last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship into use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after receiving it.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware deficiencies" that rendered the warship unusable if they had been used on a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly significant as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class were managed by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the workforce of older Bremen-class high-speed sailboats.
It was also revealed that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, which weighs 7,000 tons, is probably twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project, including training the team, also becomes a problem.
It is said to amount to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the newer high-speed sails are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German navy is losing power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy had actually "run out of ships eligible for withdrawal".
The official said the issue has grown as a snowball over time as the old ships were withdrawn, but no replacement ships came in.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class high-speed sailors could join the Navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret lives of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for their food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
A study by researchers from the National Trust of Scotland traces common and soprano peppers in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders are placed at the main sites of the site to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct field research using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings determines the frequency of bat cries and the activity of the species.
A habitat map and report are then created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help determine the utility of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affects their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting, their ears are more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, reviews, and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only special bat reserve in the Threave area of Dumfrie and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the area is ideal territory for them.
“At Threave, we have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a great place to live.
But there's still a lot to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas helps us better understand what they need."
She emphasizes the importance of controlling bats before starting care activities on the property, as the unintended destruction of one gestation and birth site can kill up to 400 females and young, and even wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, disturbing or destroying them is illegal.
Scottish Officer Elisabeth Ferrell of the Bats Defence Association has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats and we just don’t know how many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations while lawyers plan to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is reported to have paid the woman €330,643.10 not to report the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Turning to Instagram’s live video of its 142 million followers half an hour after the allegations, Ronaldo (33) was reported to be “fake news.”
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What has been said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the news.
They want to promote themselves with my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all right," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for “unauthorized suspicion of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player is seeking compensation for "moral damage commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most severe personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's hotel room where he was allegedly raped, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent a good man", of whom "one percent fail".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple's sexual relationship, but it was not unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photos of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he feared "revenge" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
Now, the 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to refute the solution, as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United and joined Real Madrid during the alleged attack, and that summer he moved to Italy in connection with a $100 million deal with giant Juve.
Brexit: UK could regret leaving car manufacturers forever
The UK would "forever regret it" if it lost its position as the world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop their production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border crossing stalls without a Brexit deal could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see a halt to the manufacturing process at our plant," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK automakers have also feared leaving the EU without a deal, concerned about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for one month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
The Toyota production line works as needed, with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than a day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, so production would have to be halted.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the EU’s future relationship was “precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want the best solution that allows us to do what we want, and not just take advantage of the current success, but take full advantage of the opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain suite.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a Unite union spokesman who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said: “We know from experience that if jobs are lost, they won’t come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's highly-contributed meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by another week as the fight against top-ranked candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of commissioner Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, connections between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire a deputy attorney general and thereby threaten Mueller's independence has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of wiretapping tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, announcing that he intends to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then in New York at the United Nations.
Trump said he did not want Rosenstein fired, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a run-off hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who has accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump spokesman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be delayed by another week, taking into account all the things going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep the press informed, as always."
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to TV journalists being deliberately frustrated, though he added, "I don't disagree with the fact that they've been disappointed."
He then suggested a direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," he said, without adding any evidence: "We've looked at these numbers."
Sanders said: “If the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
"We're trying to do a lot of this and you've seen how we've done it over the last couple of weeks, so it's going to be at the time of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York City, the president demonstrated perhaps why, being casual and sometimes bizarre in appearance before the gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU staff in NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express her country’s gratitude and wishes for them to remain post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman of MSP sent her letter when the UK’s withdrawal from the EU was less than six months away.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs associated with the established status of EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued this summer, heading towards the expected decisions of this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
Therefore, I now wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers support player Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury on Saturday and a 31:27 defeat by Vanderbilt Commodores, published by the Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened just before halftime.
“He fell on his side and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on his side before he was put on a stretcher taken off the field for further inspection.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center had ended.
Harris added that there are no details on the type/range of the injury as yet, and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Red-shirted sophomore Abercrombie was in his first season at Tennessee State after coming over from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 matches that season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK, using this extra money to help the homeless under new Tory plans
This move undermines Corbyn’s drive to attract young voters
Stamp duty is levied on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Finance Ministry expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty rate if they buy property in the UK, using this extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to thwart Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with promises of affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp tax is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, diverting extra money to the government's desire to combat homelessness.
The premium - which is in addition to this stamp duty, including the higher levels set two years ago for second home and forward rental-related purchases - can be as high as three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes this move will generate up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of purchased London properties are owned by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet down when purchasing housing.
Many of the country's affluent regions - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high if they buy land but don't use it, and urged May to drop quotas on affordable homes to improve Britain's "home-related shame".
Corbyn has announced reforms to attractive housing, including rent controls and ending harassment of innocent people.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year, I promised to commit myself as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for businesses abroad, to find it as easy to buy homes as it is for British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland'
Sunderlan's manager Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to become Scotland's leader at some point.
The Scot (42) is delighted with the challenge to revive the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, behind with only 3 points.
He moved to Stadium of Light that summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League the previous season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up looking at Scotland with my dad in Hampden, and it’s always something that has pulled me back.
This will only happen if I am successful in the management of the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland leader have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid of such large and well-known names, having previously endured in both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me at the moment, it’s a success if I can take this club to the Champions League.”
Because of its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Champions League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I can only see myself as successful if I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has served as manager for only three years, previously serving as deputy director of Dumbarton and for 15 months among Hearts' executive staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to third level and making St Mirren's lowest position to win the next championship.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he was during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real crossroad,” he recalled Alloa’s takeover.
“I truly believed that leadership was more appropriate for me than playing games.
It feels weird because I did it, got a reasonable income, and enjoyed some highlights.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things that need to be done weekly.
I still experience this in terms of the tension and pressure of my work, but the management just seems more correct.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and I'm more comfortable now than I ever was in adulthood."

According to the study, the best time for a pint is Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of pubs in the UK, but more pressure has been put on restaurant chains.
Figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while that of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, from CGA, said: “Continuous sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was similar to June, when pubs’ turnover grew by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were getting even harder.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant trade in June further deteriorated in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars were the most successful and restaurants are the worst-liked.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurateurs.
I guess people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased 6.6 percent during the month, while food sales fell three percent."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to sales outside the home market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant chains continue to struggle, although a fall of 4.8 percent compared to last year is particularly painful in addition to ongoing price pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food companies, and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide some much-needed relief."
Total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were up 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand-related agencies.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 activity groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion and is a benchmark for the established industry.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some 11-year-olds, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 high school students found the growth of “fake Insta” leaves
News raised fears of sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "core account" for showing parents
The study found that one in five children, some of them just 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a significant increase in “fake Insta” accounts.
The news exacerbated fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had both a "core account" designed to show their parents and a "core account" made to be acceptable to themselves.
One of his 13-year-old daughters discovered a secret leaf and found out that the teenager invited others to rape him.
The Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles and half admitted to having personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing to see so many teenagers being lured into creating accounts online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to become an athletics spokesperson on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the board of directors at the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most praised athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the team, described the event as "a great opportunity" for sports leaders to benefit from his wide international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidhi is respected throughout Scotland, the UK and other sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from being invited to his leadership,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a spokesperson for athletes and I hope I can make a real contribution to the sport in Scotland and contribute to its development.”
An American who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and now shares his opinion frequently with the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that whether I would recover and if so, to what extent, only time would show.
I have worked hard, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and am already doing speed training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast Pump Advertising That Compares Women to Cows Splits the Internet in Two
The breast pump company has divided the internet into two camps with advertising comparing the nursing mother to the milking cows.
To celebrate the presentation of "the world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a similar commercial for the ironic music video to showcase the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who want to live.
The four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with their cows and sing, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see my tail" and "If you didn't notice, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
Repeated verse: “Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.”
However, advertising on the company's Facebook page has generated controversy on the internet.
Viewers of the video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and has thousands of comments, disagree. Many of them say that it illuminates the behind-the-scenes of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to promote this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that they steal babies from them in a matter of days after they are born.”
The Elvie breast pump does not stick out the nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter said: “It’s clearly traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use the breast pump of mothers who keep these babies?"
Someone added: "Totally inconceivable advertising."
Some of them are in favor of publicity, and one of the women found the story hilarious.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a total cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but let's just take it as it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad for moms pumping and feeling like cows (often in their workplaces or bathrooms).
This ad neither disapproves nor condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all danced in bras with non-obtrusive pumps.
The idea of the campaign is based on the saying that many women pumping breast milk feel like a cow.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and does not stand out from the nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move around, keep babies and even go outside while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and irritating introduction.
By comparing the possibilities of women’s expression and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the pumping of the breast and all its challenges, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary sense of freedom created by the new pump.
This isn't the first time the news has covered the Elvie pump.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children, Marta Jakubowski, appeared on the stage.
Thousands of Migrant Children Quietly Entered Camp on Texas Border
The number of children of the detained migrants has risen sharply, although the monthly border crossings have remained quite the same, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies enforced by the Trump administrator have made it difficult to establish children with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and they have been afraid of violating the possibility of staying in their country, for which they require custody of the child.
The threat increased in June when national authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adults in the household could provide fingerprints and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress last week that the agency arrested a dozen people who requested financial support for non-accompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal history.
"Nearly 80 percent of sponsors or members of the sponsor household are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are from a criminal background.
So we will continue to pursue them," Mr Albence said.
To deal more quickly with children, officials enforced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being arrested. Previously, according to asylum workers, it was after 60 days.
Many protect their legal content in front of immigration judges by videoconferencing instead of coming in.
Unfits for release are quickly expelled from the country.
According to the shelter's staff, and based on system reports released in recent months - the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent demonstrations or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more pressing in large detention facilities like Tornillo, where a child’s falling into difficulties may be overlooked due to their size.
They added that moving children to a tented campus without giving them enough time to get used to the feeling or say goodbye to friends could create trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of U.S., French and Turkish occupying forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to come home to the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualemi, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegally on the pretext of counterterrorism and would be dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that Syria’s “war on terror is almost over” and that more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until we have cleared the entire Syrian area" of both terrorist groups and "any foreign forces that are illegally present."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in its war-torn country.
Speaking on the subject of war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and he accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that would prevent refugees from coming.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them," he said.
“They are politicizing something that is just a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive rehabilitation aid until an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey creating a buffer zone in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale crackdown by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "explicit deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would hit militants, including Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front militants who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convince a new committee of government and opposition members to plan a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made demands for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warning against interference.
Why Trump will be elected to a second term
By this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal have not ended his presidency sooner, as liberal viewers probably want.
Which would undoubtedly be the "most exciting end of the presidency!"
At the moment, viewers are not showing signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during peak hours. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has increased. 3.5 million viewers via cable on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show have kept its rating high during the main evening news.
"This is the tension we're involved in because we don't understand it," said the head of ABC's drama Designated Survivor about the government secretary who becomes president when an attack destroys the parliament building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The leader told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“He said he made me laugh,” Ms. Scovell told me.
All this chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, Washington’s rumors could prove fatal to Roe v. Wade’s future and to the migrant families and global economy that want to reunite.
Avoiding the subject is only a luxury for the privileged.
But a six-hour expert talk show featuring Bob Woodward’s “in-depth background study” for his book Fear, and Paul Manafort’s $1,225.73 ostrich-skin Bomber jacket (The Washington Post called it “a garment of overconfidence”), and Stormy Daniels’ behind-the-scenes description of Mr. Trump’s anatomy, the viewer is more than an educated citizen.
I will never watch Super Mario again.
“One of his activities, which might sound like a reality show, is that he shares something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series, with the changing actors and daytime plotters of Trump’s show (noddling with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

When Fleiss met her this week, her home on the northern shore of Kauai was 80 degrees, but she had crawled into the room to watch MSNBC while recording on CNN.
He couldn’t help but watch Brett Kavanaugh succeed in the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court’s fate hang in the balance.
"I remember doing all sorts of crazy shows back then and people saying this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Cash Flow Moves to the Worst Midterm Election in the White House
It is no wonder that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow through the reorganization of the congressional district, getting the two incumbents to the same seat.
As a result, suburban Pittsburg district number one Democratic Republic candidate Conor Lamb was re-elected, winning a seat in the second district last spring in an extraordinary election.
Lamb's opposing candidate is Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the previous Pennsylvania's 12th district, which in the larger section overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were changed following a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, causing the old districts to be divided into unconstitutional electoral districts, favoring Republicans.
The election of the new 17th has triggered a campaign that trumps the financial departments of the major political parties - the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a slim victory over the much-watched March in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in an emergency election.
This seat has been held by a Republican for several decades, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political opinion-makers have given Democrats a small advantage.
El Salvador punished for supporting China, then retreated
Diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a minor setback for Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump met in a friendly atmosphere with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a Panama hotel until partners expelled Trump's corporate administration team.
Foreign ministry officials have decided to recall American leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after ministry spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that the two countries had recently stopped supporting Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was to be punished, receiving $140 million in aid from America in 2017, including for drug surveillance, development, and economic impetus.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to organize a sequel to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a development in efforts to prevent settlers from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and end the discussion of any El Salvadoran sentences.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now be questioned, who will speak at a meeting in mid-October to discuss the government's views.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh reports or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of what three American officials had said, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic discussions on the issue of anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the demand to remain anonymous.
Study history
What could happen next is that special counsel Robert Mueller publishes a report on Trump's possible administration of justice, about which there is a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating in his study whether the Trump campaign is linked to the Russian attack on our election.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would have to report to the agency as if he were going to speak to voters again, and perhaps even to his peers as judges.
There are many butts here, and I don’t want to imply that Trump or his European counterparts are inescapable.
We must all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were prepared for a coup against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Münich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the multi-year carnage that followed.
History revolves around such turning points, and the merciless march of democracy comes closer or is delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water ever since it was reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his unfitness for the post.
Rosenstein says The Times' statement is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the FBI’s recent investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is neither complete nor fair, or if he’s confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And, above all, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections if Trump should be held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter vacation.
But I believe that we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our ambassadorial home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me the light of Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Australia, following an impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month in Spain, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make his first appearance of the season before a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarrea has a strong opponent," said the 31-year-old player.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was generally a fair result.
They played better in the first half and we played again in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but as the crowd supports us, I'm sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was tough, because of that, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good gut feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully now we can move on, put the last season behind us and be successful."
Women unable to sleep due to fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide study participants said they would talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want family to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
But that should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can not prepare your family for care if they do not know your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely important in terms of costs.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan for how to pay for these costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or proprietary self-insurance – as long as you have the cash you need.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already in the bud.
Get yourself a health care credentials to identify a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes at a time when you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also, consider the trustee regarding your financial position.
Choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions related to medication and allergies?
Write these things down so that you are ready when you need to.
“It’s not just the financial side, it’s also who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What medications are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put it all in place."

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll is still rising.
As communications have been cut off, rescuers have received no information from the Donggala regency north of Palu, which is closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake's epicentre.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located on a narrow bay off the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, and had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was unexpectedly hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala regents are an area that extends over 300 km (180 miles) to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regents, an administrative area under the province's authority, had an estimated 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowal, Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, on December 26, in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake struck the southern half of Indonesia's most populated island of Java, creating a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck the area near the provincial capital of West Sumatra, Padang.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Sumatran islands - Mentawai Island, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami brought destruction.
There was no tsunami at the time, but more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested over domestic violence allegations
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, over suspicions of domestic violence, interference with the domestic violence report, and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a female person attempted to report the alleged crimes to the police, Palin took her phone.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su's investigation facility and is being held on $500 unsecured bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he "is by no means guilty", the news network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, police were called in by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence crime report, and possessing a gun, all while intoxicated.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for associating her son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of her service in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not functioning and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the outskirts of downtown Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.
Videos circulate on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palu town.
In NYC, federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having committed a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This rare punishment has not been carried out for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bike path along the West Side Highway on Lower Manhattan, mowing both pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
According to a death penalty notice filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors are required to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily harm in order to justify the death penalty.
In both cases, according to court documents, there is a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which included eight murder charges, along with extortion generally used by federal prosecutors for organized criminal offenses, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "intensive planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "horrible, cruel and indecent."
"Sayfullo Habibulaveic Saipov caused injuries, harms and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It’s been 10 years since New York’s Southern District Court’s last death trial.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out was in 1953 in a federal case between Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in New York, where the couple were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native Uzbek, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he had told investigators that he was happy about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of ISIS viewed from his phone.
According to police, he also wanted the ISIS flag displayed in his hospital room.
He has not pleaded guilty to the 22-point charge.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "obviously disappointed" in the procedural decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty will prolong the trauma for all concerned, instead of a life sentence without a release,” Patton said.
Previously, the Saipov defense team asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during today's Tory Conference protest.
A former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" of eurosceptics after one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the House of Commons, said at a march in Birmingham that the UK "would be out by now" if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May faces the problem of reconciling her deeply divided ranks, highlighted by pro-remaining conservatives, by joining her anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track amid Brexit supporters, stayers and EU attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite the backlash and force the Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between his package and the "chaos".
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "opt out of the Chequers plan".
He suggested taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"We'd be out there by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I'm standing up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers plan."
Reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: "We didn't fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has now changed since the 2016 vote: “The notion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Tory Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: “Let me just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition won’t vote for it, it’s unpopular with our party and with our activists who are actually walking the streets and electing us in general.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message to May, she added, "Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians at the gathering must be made to "feel the heat" if they plan to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not going to let that happen’.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, uncomfortable.
"We will mobilize the nation's army that defeated us with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have gained an independent, self-governing, proud Britain."
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour gathering held at the center of the city.
A handful of activists waved slogans of "Tories Against Brexit" after the group's creation this weekend.
The Liberal Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues their party's application faced at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say that they can put the IT systems in place and bring all the technology to Canada and more, for smooth border crossing, cross-border unrestricted trade to Ireland," he added.
“This is a farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after November election
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future on Saturday at Western Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run in the next election in November against GOP National Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the vice chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that he may face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
He asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, that is, the First Lady.”
The shooting of LSU Sims
LA Police in Baton Rouge on Saturday said the suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims had been arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson around 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and died in the aftermath," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, possessing a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them in the starting lineup, averaging 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world championship after team scoring victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that point on, it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Mercedes team ranking would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and nearly neglected Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two occasions and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the pit stops and left Hamilton at the back of the group in tight traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the pit stop lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went into the lead after a side-by-side position when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside side free to pass after a third corner attempt to defend it with a double move.
Max Verstappen started the race from the back of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first round for his 21-year-old birthday.
He then led the race most of the time, driving towards the finish in rubbers and past Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He eventually drove to the pit stop on lap 44, but failed to increase his speed in the last eight laps, which gave Räikkönen fourth place.
Today is a tough day because Valtteri worked hard all week and was a real gentleman passing me by.
“The team has done a great job of having one of two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's gathering over the incident, saying she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address Ford's testimony directly to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on current events in the Senate that show people to be "evil, disgusting, and deceitful."
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and is happening right now in the Senate in a couple of days is that you see angry and angry, mean, nasty and deceitful people,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks that say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you leak the document?”
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added with the senator's expression.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July about the charges against Kavanaugh, which was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep it confidential, and according to his request, I did.”
But his denial did not suit the president, who said during Saturday’s rally: “You know what, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it's one of the worst body languages I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats were using these allegations for their own ends.
“They have decided to take back power without choosing means.
You see the meanness and disgust, they don't care who they hurt, they have to run over in order to gain power and control," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Giants' Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
Dundee Stars defeated the Belfast Giants in an elite league rematch on Saturday, losing 5:3.
The Giants took the lead early in the game with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie before Dwyer led the Giants to lead again.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's goals secured their victory.
This was the third defeat for Adam Keefe's men in the elite league, who came to Belfast on Friday night to beat Dundee 2-1.
This was the fourth meeting of the season, of which the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back in the quick first third 13:10 back into the game before Matt Marquardti helped Cownie kick a 15:16 minute tie goal.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break, scoring the second goal of his night at the end of the first third.
On the home court, the players rallied again and Bouchard again placed them on the level, scoring a 27:37 goal in the numerically superior minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the second-third of the game, securing a victory in the last-third in their team's offensive zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of people from earthquake
One Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe take-off of an aircraft carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday caused a tsunami that left more than 800 people dead, many of whom remain missing.
The area is plagued by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped under the ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that colleagues of 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung escaped from the fluctuating air tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on duty to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which had been on the runway at the time.
He then jumped out of the tower, thinking it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We have prepared a helicopter to transport Kalimantan from Balikpapan to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning, even before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were very sad when we heard about it,” the spokesman added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to thousands. According to the State Disaster Relief Agency, access was restricted to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: "The death toll could increase as the bodies of many of the victims are still in ruins and have not been recovered."
The six-meter-high waves devastated the city of Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “The ambulance is making new sacrifices every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they might find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready for that?” said CNN.
The Indonesian city of Lombok was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin airliner says one man missing after lagoon crash
Although it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane, the airliner that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is missing.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, they were unable to find one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger's details, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it landed on the Chuuk Island airfield.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six other passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airliner and the United States Navy said the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low when it landed.
“That’s good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers were able to wade into waist-high water at the crash exit.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy and sailors who worked on the nearby pier also assisted in the rescue by using inflatable boats to take people ashore before the plane sank some 30 feet into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in air crashes involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them were connected to Air Niugin.
An analyst prepares a schedule of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office on Saturday completed a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours analyzing intelligence as an expert observer.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to recreate the movements of Quinton Tellis, a 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, a 19-year-old victim, on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett received location information from several mobile phones, indicating that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted the young man's earlier claims.
When the records showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis "was lying because my car was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased the girl from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to make its hearing on Sunday.
The judge said he thinks the case will go to jury hearings later the same day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to fight negative genre definition by adding positive messages to the music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has distanced itself from the root of its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to hip hop roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Bands such as The Fugees and Common have recently re-emerged in the UK, thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York nanny sues couple over racist message
The New York City nanny is suing the couple for discriminatory dismissal after a message accidentally received from the mother complaining that the nanny was “another black man.”
The couple denies that they are racist compared to the situation of blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned that her new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first day in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying, “EIIIIIIIIIIII, SUSTAINABLE BLACKWAX.”
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable, fired Miss Maurice after understanding her boob, claiming that their sociable nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had been expecting a Filipino in her place.
Miss Maurice was paid for one workday and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal he wishes to receive daily for the next six months, and the same job he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show them that look, that’s what they do,” he told The Post, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have rejected the claim that they are racist, saying that ending the working relationship with Maurice was a reasonable thing to do, as they feared that after insulting the maid, they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
“We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you allow your children to be held by a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison to blackmail, Plasco said his wife was two months away from having a baby and was in "a very difficult situation".
“Would you go against someone like that?
It's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the lawsuit is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, where they are severely criticized for their behavior and thinking.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers would not interact with talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said in a letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of the person who first read it before publication.
It's a lot of fun to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
He said that his father, inspired by writing a children's book about a little teddy bear, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, would have been optimistic about his work being rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release had been a sad outcome of his father's death last year.
About Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he also added that his father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
“He was a quiet man and not a proud man,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like feeling like your child was achieving something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not exactly your achievement.
I think he looked at Paddington's success this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"They called regularly to say that the daughter was in a very bad condition and that they did not believe she would survive," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nadi, who said my daughter would die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, ‘Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
See you soon.
Soon I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating had begun to slowly disappear and leave her body.
He was dead for a while before that, and now all systems are shutting down.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't howl, scream, or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold myself together."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing of her experiences.
"No one knew that," he said.
“I held my head down and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outpouring of compassion for Nadi on that flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Previous PostPrevious Woman’s Postcards Prevent Suicide on the Bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pasted maps of Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when she suffered from depression, and 18 when she killed herself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile would make the whole room shine."
Despite this, he stopped working before he died because he was “in a very bad place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it has a domino effect.”
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even a friend.
Don't be silent - you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after her husband's mother died.
“He didn’t say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
She was at her lowest point on Christmas Day – when the children opened their presents, she had no eye contact with them or anything."
Ms. Humphreys said that her husband’s death was a terrible trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: “It’s tearing the wound into the whole family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we have to keep going and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI opens an investigation
“I believed that if we actually got what he wanted – a limited time and scope study – we might be able to achieve unity,” Flake said, adding that he feared the committee would “fall together” amid a persistent partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on November 6th, and if the Republicans don't do as well as they expected, they're going to be severely weakened in their intentions to get the man they want to take over the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call the Senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast a decisive vote and Kavanaugh to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defector numbers 'shrink' under Kim's government
South Korea's legislature has said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has been falling since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said that compared to 2011's runaways (2706) their number had fallen last year (1,127).
Mr Park said the main factors were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
A large number of North Koreans have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul magazine, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest state border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China takes defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the elimination of the stalled nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, where they pledged to work broadly towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of sanctions for lack of progress.
“Unbelieved in the United States, our country has no security, and under such circumstances we are not in any way willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "unfit for a Supreme Court judge".
House opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "temperamentally unfit" to work as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi expressed his opinion in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help noticing that if a woman had performed this way, she would have been labeled hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while both were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, from time to time he almost screamed when describing his family and his high school years, and at times remained speechless.
He also explicitly condemned members of the Democratic Party on the committee, calling the accusations against him over Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat an organized "grotesque and coordinated reputation assassination" of angry liberals.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved him unfit to serve as a Supreme Court judge because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself by the way he spoke and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi remained modest when he was asked if he would try to remove Kavanaugh should the Democrats win a majority in the House.
"I'll tell you this much -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not just a judge on the Supreme Court, he's not a judge on the court he's currently working in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about possible rulings against the Kavanaugh Affordable Care Act (health care law – translator's note) or Roe v. Wade (abortion law-abiding court precedent – translator's note) because the man is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
“This is not a time when a hysterical biased person can become a judge and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t it great?’” Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It's fair talk, months and years of intense anger, and he can't get away with it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued: “I got help from a woman who was in charge; she said she was crying too when she got angry, but she worked out a method, which was that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partially accepted as the output of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is of an early job in an office with a majority of men, where I once found myself weeping in indescribable rage when an elderly woman – a strict leader I had always feared – grabbed me by the collar and dragged me into the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and it gives them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, after Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a Monkey Business yacht, a deeply upset Schroeder thought there was no reason why he shouldn’t think about running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me, laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was someone else to join.”
Someone said it was like “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was drawing to a close, he was late in fundraising, and he vowed not to run unless he received a $2 million total.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 to the men, gave him only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave a speech announcing that he would not launch an official campaign, his feelings of gratitude to the people who supported him, his irritability for a system that made it difficult for him to raise funds and turn to voters instead of delegates, and his hatred for sexism were so overcome that he became downcast.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled the press's reaction against him.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they wrote on my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The openings in the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, experts say the split between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning shot this year, imposing taxes on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on $200bn (£150bn) worth of goods, essentially imposing taxes on half of the goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated on every occasion, most recently with tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to shoot back at the U.S., and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
Falling back in Washington would mean yielding to demands, but bowing publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its cards right, a trade war with the US could support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause another country to lose control of its economy is actually far more dangerous than has been previously acknowledged by outsiders," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister says Syria ready for refugee return
Syria says it is ready to return voluntarily and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the territory of the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists in order to bring back normality.
All conditions are now in place for refugees who have left the country voluntarily to return because of terrorism and because of unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another 6 million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or aid from states that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team at the Le Golf National golf course near Paris, France, with a final score of 16.5 vs. 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling throughout the tournament, threw a knockout on the par-3 track into 16 waters, handing the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all of his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have achieved the tournament in the current format that began in 1979 with a result of 5 : 0 : 0.
Jordan Spieth scored 5&4 with Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest-placed Dane in the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, beat the Englishman Ian Poulter by 2 and 1 to become the last person to win the Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veterans, Hispanic Sergio Garcia, became the most-winning European of all time with 25.5 career points in the competition.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the trophy back.
It's about team spirit and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia, who is emotional, after winning Europe.
He passes the torch to fellow countryman Jon Rahm, who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has his career Ryder Cup result of 13:21:3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major league titles, behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
After the team’s disappointing performance, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of the guys, they were spirited.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players did a great job.
Let's get it together, work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to lift your hat.
We played better."
New information on water blooms: decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows an overall decrease in the concentration of blooming algae in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there are reports of more patchy blooms in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties, suggesting declining concentrations.
The extent of the waterfall is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern end of Pinellas County to the southern end of Lee County.
The spots can be found 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there has been a decline compared to the previous week.
Water blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Average concentrations in Pinellas County have been reported from coastal or offshore, Hillsborough County from low to high concentrations in offshore, Manatee County from background to high concentrations, Sarasota County from coast and offshore from background to high concentrations, Charlotte County from background to average concentrations, Lee County from coast and offshore from background to high concentrations, and Collier County from low concentrations.
The counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier continue to receive reports of respiratory irritation.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida during the past week.
