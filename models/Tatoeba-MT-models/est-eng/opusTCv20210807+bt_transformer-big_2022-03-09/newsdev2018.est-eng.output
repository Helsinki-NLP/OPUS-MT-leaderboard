Two influential women share their secrets to success
What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Al have in common?
At first glance, these women come from two completely different worlds.
Barbara Corcoran, a New York City real estate tycoon, was able to convert a thousand-dollar loan into a five-billion-dollar real estate company before implementing her expertise on the television screen by participating in an investor panel for ABC’s reality show Shark Tank.
Laila Ali has followed in her father’s footsteps, becoming the most successful female boxer as a four-time undefeated champion, before adding the roles of TV host, author and speaker to her resume.
Despite (or perhaps because of) their unique career paths, TJ Maxx recruited both women to help talk to a hall of hopeful entrepreneurs about breaking stereotypes and achieving lofty goals.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores around the country and found that 80 percent of them feel that society has stereotypically set certain roles and expectations for them.
As a result, they came up with The Maxx You Project to help women break down these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know a lot about it, and they may be at the top of their field by now, but the journey wasn't smooth for either of them.
Corcoran received a grade of mostly D's in high school and college and had been working at 20 jobs by the time he was 23.
Ali entered one of the most male-centred areas and faced the challenge of trying to step out of the shadow of his father, who was a global icon.
These two, to put it mildly, burst through the difficulties of acquired knowledge.
Therefore, we sat down with these influential women to talk about overcoming failures, coping with success, and trusting our gut feelings in business and relationships.
What inspires you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I am inspired by my personal goals every day.
I have developed the habit of writing down the things I want to achieve.
And I'll look at that list.
I think I'm responsible.
I am inspired by my children.
My ambition inspires me.
I want to be victorious in everything I do.
I understand that it takes hard work to achieve my goals, but I am prepared to do so.
My confidence comes from preparation.
I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Laila, the key to my self-confidence is over-preparation, but I don’t draw my inspiration from it.
In fact, I am inspired by curiosity.
What happens if I do this?
What's not gonna happen if I don't?
This curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning because I can’t wait to see what the day brings.
If I don't feel that way some day, I'll just fake those feelings.
Then I believe in myself and get inspired again.
Talk about some obstacles in your career that made you look much better in the long run.
Barbara Corcoran: The hardest thing for me was when my business partner dumped me and married my secretary.
I stopped doing business a year later, but this year of my life – being the fifth wheel – was terrible because I didn’t have the confidence to leave.
I felt defeated, lacking any inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
The hardest part is believing in those moments when you're going through a setback.
The year spent on getting yourself back on track and starting up a business again from scratch - this time without a partner - was extremely difficult.
Laila Ali: I would say that the hardest time in my career was when I was boxing, I was at the top of my career and I decided to file for divorce.
I divorced not only my husband, but also the manager and the person who taught me everything I know about boxing.
I didn't think I could do it without him.
So I started to worry about the future of my career and had to find time to take a step back and say to myself, “You have all the knowledge and experience you need.
You have all these experiences in the boxing ring.
You can do it without a doubt."
So I formed a new team around me and continued my career.
In fact, it was just necessary to achieve the right state of mind, because the rest got the push from there.
I did what had to be done, had to face fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and my manager and continue my career.
When did you feel like you were really successful?
Laila Ali: I felt that I had achieved success when I won my first championship title.
It was a really good feeling, because when I started boxing, I wanted to be one of the best, to be invincible.
I was able to achieve that goal, and I won the championship title not once, but four times.
Barbara Corcoran: One of the moments when I felt that I had achieved success was in my eleventh year of acting.
I was finally making a profit.
I had made a profit of about $42,000, which I didn’t expect.
I went out and bought a new car for my mom and dad, and they never had a new car, so I had the cars delivered to Florida, where they spent their retirement.
I felt like the Queen of England.
I felt so cool.
I earned a lot more in the years that followed, but nothing has been able to offer the same feeling as giving something back to my parents and surprising them.
How did you manage to stay motivated during this 11-year period to keep working?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit because that was not my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could go.
On my first day, I dreamed of becoming a real estate queen in New York.
And I saw myself in my mind's eye as a pope - everyone kisses my ring and adores me.
I had this little idea in my head.
So, as I struggled every day, every hour, I didn’t really think about making money.
In the end, I made money by accident.
But all the money that came in, I immediately put back into business.
I don't even think I had any scary days where I thought, oh my God, we're not making money.
I was just convinced that something was going to work.
The worst thing that could have happened was to lose the company and become a waitress again.
I made a good tip and I was happy.
I could be happy again.
Therefore, I do not believe that the great ambition of many successful people is money.
They have other motivations that inspire them.
And the money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice for someone who has such big dreams but is held back by a financial factor?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have the time.
I set up a company.
And that's why I found myself with five different partners who weren't even specialists in the brokerage business, but in different neighborhoods everywhere in the city who knew their streets through and through.
I approached them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you money and you'll be my partner."
The lesson here is that if you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have talent, you can sell it to someone who has money and make money with it instead.
There are two aspects to this: talent and money.
But when you're not both together, nothing big happens.
In the end, I - and my partners as well - have done very well over the years, together with the great investors that I would never have had if I had not had the courage to find people who are competitive and who like to be active.
You can always raise money if you believe you have talent and know your part of the world better than anyone else.
What are two or three things you do every morning that will help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don't know about you guys, but I have a lot of moments in my life where I feel overwhelmed being a mother, a businesswoman, a husband... all the roles we play as women.
I got to a point in my life where I really needed to set up my morning routine.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Gratitude for the resurrection, for your health, for your children, for your family.
I often write down my goals for the next day, and when I wake up, I look at the list again.
Meditating.
Sometimes I write in a journal.
I always drink a cup of coffee.
I always exercise first thing in the morning because if I don’t, I don’t do it.
For me, it is ultimately about priorities.
These are the things that are important to me: my spirituality, my focus on the universe and God, then my training and putting my health first.
Thanks to this, everything else seems simple.
I feel that I can conquer any challenge that comes my way during the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I'm putting things in order of importance.
I'm working through my to-do list, which is endless and ridiculous.
And I'll figure out what's most important.
What are the real priorities?
I try to accept the most important things.
What are you doing to get yourself into the right frame of mind for the big meeting?
Barbara Corcoran: I can imagine myself failing.
Strange as it may be.
I mean, God, I'm failing.
I'm scared of myself, and it makes me try harder.
I can imagine anyone competing with me - I'm naturally very competitive because I'm one of ten children and we never got enough of our parents' attention.
I can be very competitive.
And I always come in too thoroughly prepared.
Excess preparation strengthens my self-confidence.
Laila Ali: It's amazing how contradictory we are in this regard.
We are two successful people and this shows how different things work for different people.
I like to think I’m successful.
I like to think about the end, which is success.
I can see it happening, I can actually see it happening.
I see myself stepping into the ring, going into the fight, winning the belt and returning to the dressing room, celebrating the victory with a piece of cake, like I've always done.
The same applies to meetings.
However, I always prepare myself thoroughly, and this confidence comes precisely from preparation, because there is a fear in the back of my head that I am not doing well or that I am not saying the right things or that I do not have the necessary information.
This is where the game comes in for me.
But I always come in visualizing the end result.
You've both been very successful in your careers.
How do you pass it on?
Laila Ali: I'm very excited to be a part of the T.J. Maxx Project Maxx You Project because I feel like it's an opportunity to do good.
A lot of women need inspiration, encouragement to pursue their dreams and goals.
There is a champion in all of us.
It's really about having the mind and the tools you need, surrounding yourself with the right people, people who have been able to achieve the things you're trying to achieve.
Barbara Corcoran: One thing I think I do very well is inspire people.
I was very excited to work with Maxx You Project.
I try to light the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward.
A lot of people start to realize their dreams, but they tend to get lost at some point.
We are trying to help you focus on that goal.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even such a simple thing as a lift call, everything you need to set up a business.
What advice would you give to women who want to succeed in male-centred fields?
Laila Ali: I work in one of the most male-focused fields, which is boxing.
Coming after his father, who was a global icon and the best of all time, was pretty daunting.
For me, the essence of the matter was actually to find its talent, its courage, its strength in itself.
The first thing I had to believe in was that I could get into the ring and be successful.
At the time, no one else was involved but me, and there were no restrictions on my path except the ones I had set in my head.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having an attitude like mine - "The Real Estate Queen of New York" - and crossing the finish line is enormously long.
And in this intermediate phase, which is every day in your professional career, you need a lot of talents.
You don’t have to deal with real estate in order to need these talents.
I am sure that in Laila’s field too, it was necessary to decide what the right people are, the right managers, when to start, when to finish, how much money you have, what you can put in, what not to put in, how hard you are ready to work.
These are all subjective decisions.
I'm trying to make these efforts a little bit stronger so that these women really feel, "Okay, I get it.
Let me try.
Here are my three priorities."
When they leave with three top priorities to really make things happen, I go home at night smiling into bed.
What's on your nightstand right now?
Laila Ali: Too much junk.
Magazines, books, little angel of prayer, my diary.
Probably a water bottle.
Barbara Corcoran: My bedside table has a little green turn-up alarm clock because I tried to break the habit of looking at the phone first thing every morning.
That's why I got it.
That was sweet.
But it never worked.
And it's still there.
My phone is still on my nightstand.
What book are you reading right now?
Barbara Corcoran: For the eighth or ninth time, "How to Win Friends and Influence People".
It keeps me on the right track.
I think it's still the best book written in this field, no matter what your dreams are. Dreams can't be achieved without other people.
And it is possible to relate to it today in the same way as in the past.
I like to read it from time to time.
This will help me get back on the right track.
Laila Ali: I’m studying in nutrition school, which is why I read the book “A Wheatless Diet”.
It’s about eating grains and how they affect our bodies.
That's very interesting to me.
What is your best advice for success and failure?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore the pessimists.
They come in all kinds of different shapes.
You need to remove them from your brain vocabulary.
Stay away from whiners.
They'll drain you of your energy.
I treat thieves like thieves.
They come in the night, grab your wallet and leave.
Pessimists, in any team situation, destroy a team faster than you can blink your eyes, because people who feel sorry for themselves want others to feel bad too.
They're pulling good people into a hole with them.
I know how to avoid all negative people within 50 km of me, because my goal is to be positive and take everything I can from life and give everything I have to give.
So why would I want to spend a minute on people like that?
Laila Ali: You have to be consistent.
We start many times with confidence that we are now taking this path.
Let's do this, this and that.
But people don't follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they cross the last hill.
So I think we need to stay on track.
When you believe in something, you have to be consistent.
And you have to do the hard work that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: There's a lot of work to be done to ensure consistency.
Do you know what it takes?
Finishing things.
When you start something, you finish it.
Many are good starters, but not very good graduates.
Latvia has the largest number of non-citizens in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja.
There are 125,344 stateless people living in Riga, 14,266 in Daugavpils and 11,909 in Liepāja.
Outside of large cities, the largest number of people without Latvian citizenship live in Jekabpils (2347) and Valmiera (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, there were 242,560 people living in Latvia who did not have Latvian citizenship.
In 2007, there were 392,816 Latvian stateless people living in Latvia.
Jürgen Ligi recently referred to Facebook: "The quote is a poor justification".
I am therefore not going to look back and try not to recall what has been done to re-educate human nature in history and what results have been achieved.
I will not judge whether these attempts can be considered successful or unsuccessful.
I also avoid excessive references to sources, although in the back of my head I rely on the idea of my most important teacher, Toomas Paul: all my thoughts are borrowed from somewhere, if only I remember from where exactly.
The most conspicuous campaign in Estonia today is the re-education of a citizen of the Republic of Estonia - a perfect human being.
We don't raise him the way we raise a child - in good faith that he will become a human being.
We raise him as the ruling class imagines him to be - what one person must be like to be allowed to live in Estonia and speak in public.
Censorship is perfect.
Although the local ruling class partially changed a year ago, some methods of rearing are as frightening as those of the previous ruling class, the now impoverished nobility - their brutality is not inferior to those of the former.
They're just different.
Latvian beer is the brand drink of the new era.
$0.5 million is mandatory.
The ruling class includes not only those politicians who receive a salary from the state for their work, but also those self-aware people who do politics voluntarily (read: intentionally): using Mihkel Muti’s image, they write flags of opinion, they fight on Facebook about how terrible people live around them here in degenerate Estonia, picketing, boycotting, juggling, sabotaging.
They only agree to be in the echo chamber (the English expression for people who live in a room where they only have opinions suitable for them, e.g. their own Facebook friends, etc.), but this is not possible in a conflicted Estonia.
There are still some fellow travelers who think or do something that is intolerable to the echo chamber people.
And that's where the war of words breaks out and the cannons rumble.
We have a lot of politicians who know exactly how much a person can drink, who they can sleep with, how many children they can breed, how to work, how much to get paid, when to rest, what to eat, how to relax, when to be sick, how to die.
In very important places.
When their public statements are echoed by something other than what they themselves said, they are enraged, offended, hysterical.
The fact that people in several European countries are driving in a "full head" car, and this is allowed by law, does not affect their opinion.
Zero tolerance is the only tolerance in every field, but behind zero tolerance is not caring, but downright evil.
Class hatred and racial hatred - only the likes of me will do.
Catholics can only open their mouths but never their hearts.
They believe that any "action" with which they improve society will work and be worth a try.
Fortunately for them, we have a sufficiently large guard of brilliant attention, stuntmen with mental disabilities, who jump through every window - without pain.
Therefore, when a clever peasant opens his mouth and is beaten emotionally for it in a stable of manors, it seems to us that this is reasonable.
Some of the words that definitely accompany us to the manor stables are, for example, homo, refugee, woman, violence, do some work, etc.
If you believe everything that self-serving officials, activists, and politicians (such are only a small part of all groups, but they are able to shout so that the whole society is deafening) talk and write, the citizen is not only disgusting, vulgar, and unpleasant, but also brainless, without a brain.
But let us not believe, do not tolerate compulsions, do not forbid drinking.
People in Estonia drink as much as they want, not as much as the state allows.
In any case, Estonians tolerate more if they are not forced to tolerate them.
The Estonian people do not change their behaviour two months before the elections in order to turn their backs on their popular diet after achieving the goal and again not only to get out of their mouths, but also to drive out what quickly restores unpleasant brain fat kilograms.
Anyone who does something different is not an Estonian.
I don’t think anyone can be re-educated.
I believe that people can be taught.
Drink wisely, love your family, be a hardworking, polite, attractive companion not only to your friends but to society as a whole.
You don’t have to constantly fine, restrict, forbid, force, correct, corner, throw rotten eggs at the media.
The teacher should set an example.
Are you talking about the harmful effects of tobacco?
A speeding cop in his spare time is gonna give me a ticket for speeding?
And then he gets caught with a hard-on for a colleague...
I have this tricky idea that maybe we should try to rearrange the ruling class.
Tell them not to drink in secret.
When you drink, drink in public, in the square of the Town Hall, in front of all the people.
Force to exceed the speed limit only in public - the rulers' cars, also private cars, be all red.
When you rule, rule as you would govern yourself.
Perhaps shame is enough if words and actions don't go together.
Or will we find out that we ourselves want to be ruled by those most hardened.
Because all of us, Estonians, are what we don’t want to be at all.
Where to escape from yourself?
Leaking Trump transcripts is likely a federal crime, according to former prosecutors
Those who leaked transcripts of phone calls between President Trump and foreign leaders to the press were likely to have committed a crime, former prosecutors said Thursday when lawmakers issued a call to find the accused.
"Unauthorized disclosure of these documents to the press is a crime," former District of Columbia Attorney Joe diGenova told Fox News.
These various acts, which include the disclosure of notes and transcripts of conversations between the president and foreign leaders, pose a serious threat to national security.
The Washington Post reported new details Thursday of Trump’s tense talks with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
In the first, Trump reportedly ordered the Mexican state leader to stop publicly declaring that his government would not pay for the border wall.
According to the newspaper, the transcripts contained notes suggesting that they had been classified by the Supreme Leader of the National Security Council.
The Post said they received comprehensive transcripts that had been "assembled by White House staff" and were based on records from White House note-takers.
"There is a federal law provision that makes leaking such classified information to an unauthorized person a crime, a federal crime," former New York State Attorney Doug Burns said in a telephone interview.
Although some details of these talks were revealed in February, the release of the transcripts marks a far greater blow to the White House, which is trying to reduce leaks.
The report came at a random moment as the Trump administration’s top figures were preparing to make a vigorous public appearance Friday to show their commitment to root out leakers of classified information.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center William Evanina are expected to brief the public at the Justice Department headquarters.
It is not clear whether the Justice Department is investigating The Post's leak.
In order for someone to be held accountable for this, the "definite elements must be clearly demonstrated", according to Burns.
He said there could be "battles on the subject", citing the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails and the decision not to press charges.
These considerations include the markings and history of the document and its exact classification.
In the case of secrecy, prosecutors will investigate whether the document was leaked to an unauthorized person in a way that negatively affects the interests of the United States.
"If all of this can be proven, people could undoubtedly be in a criminally defenseless situation," Burns said.
"No doubt."
Speaking about Trump’s phone transcripts, DiGenova, who was the prosecutor in espionage cases, said such documents were “usually classified as secret and superior.”
Claiming that these leaks threaten the ability of the United States government to pursue foreign policy, diGenova appealed to the Attorney General to convene a federal criminal grand jury to find the leakers.
He also said that a court order should be filed to get phone records from reporters and editors at The Washington Post - something that reporters would undoubtedly protest against.
Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee said Thursday that there should be a criminal investigation into the leaking of classified information.
"You have to find the person who leaked them - you have to punish him and you have to fire him," Lee told Fox News.
"This is unacceptable and such a thing should never happen."
Lee, who worked as a lawyer before being elected to the Senate in 2010, said such a leak was "a crime, a very serious federal crime".
"Such an act should not only involve dismissal, but also criminal proceedings, given that classified information is involved," he said.
Fox News was told that at this stage, the Justice Department's Friday announcement could provide more insight into what the Justice Department hopes to achieve rather than clarifying specific procedures.
Last week, President Sessions criticized and publicly vented his anger at the Attorney General, claiming that the latter had not made sufficient efforts to find the leakers.
"I want the Attorney General to be much tougher on leaks coming from security agencies," Trump said in a statement at the Rose Garden on July 25.
Sessions himself admitted last week to Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he was not satisfied with the efforts made to investigate the leaks, which have repeatedly set up obstacles for the president since his inauguration.
"I have not been satisfied with past proceedings and investigations of criminal leaks," Sessions said.
Even some people who are critical of the president have spoken out against the leaks, saying that such action undermines foreign policy aspirations.
"Leaking a transcript of a speech between a president and a foreign leader is outrageous, shocking and dangerous," David Frum wrote in the Atlantic on Thursday.
"It is extremely important that the president is able to communicate confidentially - and perhaps even more importantly, that foreign leaders understand that they can respond confidentially."
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), the lead Democrat on the Senate Security Committee, also told The Daily Beast that the leak is "absolutely" worrisome and should be investigated by Congress.
10 Tricks to Make Your Food Look More Attractive
Since many foods are difficult to photograph, the picture uses an entirely different ingredient that fools people, such as glue instead of milk or mashed potatoes instead of ice cream.
Youtube channel Top Trending makes an overview of which tricks are quite common in the advertising world.
When someone opens a popcorn bag or takes a hamburger out of a box, a lot of steam is thrown out.
In reality, the shot is longer and the hot food does not steam during the whole time, because the steam comes from high water content, which, for example, bread products do not have.
Therefore, cotton balls soaked in water are placed in the package or food, which has the ability to absorb and store some water there.
In close proximity to the heat, they steam up much longer than a burger or popcorn, and the product gets a freshly made look.
Potato porridge is a great help for photographers, because it does not melt in light or heat and does not significantly change the consistency of many other foods.
For example, the creamy filling of a cake or ice-cold ice cream may be replaced by mashed potatoes.
A little color and decorative elements, and the consumer has been fooled again.
The glue replaces the milk.
It is not easy to take pictures of milk, because it may not look so white in the photo.
Also, foods served with milk quickly become sloppy inside it.
Because breakfast cereals or muesli, for example, have to look crunchy and tasty in the milk, glue is used instead of milk, from which no flakes fall through.
While restaurants can put a lot of effort into making meat so that the result is juicy and ripe, this is not done in advertising.
However, the meat presented in the advertisement looks particularly attractive, as if it came directly from the grill.
However, it is often fried in a frying pan or made in an oven, and streaks are drawn on the meat after grilling with shoe wax.
It is as difficult to work with whipped cream as it is to work with ice cream because it tends to melt.
Fortunately, there is a product that is almost identical in appearance to the whipped cream - shaving foam.
So it could be a commercial on cakes or berries or inside a milkshake.
Even the top of the fruit sold in the store can have a thin layer of wax, which makes them look more shiny.
However, this is not enough for the photo and instead deodorant is sprayed on it to add gloss to the fruit.
The sauces are not very photogenic either, because over time they become more liquid or, for example, water is released from them.
Here, however, wax comes to the rescue, whose bright colors and more durable texture allow you to make an appealing appetizer image.
Wax is also likely to be used in those pictures where melting chocolate is spilled on top of a cake or ice cream.
If you notice a cake with the perfect cross-section in the ad, where the ratio of biscuit to filling is ideal, you’ll probably have used some extra layers or pieces of cardboard.
This is because by cutting the cake open, the filling can spread and spoil the picture.
If, after cutting, you push pieces of cardboard into the cake and spray them over the stuffing, it will visually leave a much more beautiful impression.
Cardboard and pins are also used inside the burger to set all the ingredients in place so they stay in place.
That's why a burger doesn't look like an advertisement on the table.
Chicken stuffed with paper.
In advertising, the oven chicken looks juicy and full-bodied, but it may not even be ready-cooked.
To add a full impression, the chicken is stuffed with paper, if necessary, sanded with mashed potatoes, and then the chicken is simply sprayed with brown paint.
Pancakes are especially used in American advertising with maple syrup, because this image makes people feel like pancakes.
In fact, the cakes absorb the syrup quickly, and the flowing stream of syrup quickly disappears from the photographer’s eyes.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed with a cleaning agent for the sofa fabric, which helps to avoid rapid absorption.
Often this does not help either, so it is the golden brown engine oil that is poured over warm pancakes and presented as syrup.
Former Soldier Sentenced to Life in Prison for Murder of Sexual Abuse Suspect
A former soldier was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man he suspected of mistreating a woman he knew.
Richard Cassidy (70) was convicted in the Glasgow High Court in June for the murder of David Farish (75) at his home in Tweedbank, Roxburghshire, in February 2016.
Judge Lord Summers called the murder "extremely brutal" as there were 14 stab wounds in the victim's body.
Defense attorney Brian McConnachie said the killing was caused by "a momentary madness" but described the circumstances as "extraordinary".
Cassidy heard that Farish had sexually abused a woman for a long time.
His lawyer said that the man went to Farish's home and "befriended" him in hopes of hearing a confession, not with a plan to kill him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy showed signs of intent on the day of the attack, and referred to a social work report that revealed that the accused had undergone special forces training in the army on how to infiltrate groups by making friends.
No charges had been brought against Farish.
In court, it was reported that after the murder, Cassidy contacted police himself and turned himself in.
McConnachie revealed that it is "difficult" for most people to realize that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The defense lawyer said, "He's never had a problem in his life before this incident.
He lived a full life until that moment of madness in February 2016."
Cassidy is said to be in poor health and has suffered a heart attack and stroke while in custody.
According to Lord Summers, he took into account the fact that Cassidy had no previous convictions and what he was allegedly told about Farish when he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 17 years.
Scottish police described the case as "a particularly heinous murder of a frail older man in his own home".
Detective David Pinkney said, "While this sentence does not negate his cruel act, I still hope it offers some sort of solution to David's family."
Monday was the last chance to offer a nice name for a rhinoceros toad born at the beginning of June.
Zookeepers now have a large box of names to go through to find the right one to announce on the zoo's birthday, August 25th.
However, the mink cubs can still be named until the day of re-independence.
From the beginning of August, the entire rhino family can be seen walking side by side in the yard.
And even though Father Kigoma occasionally runs around bloating and scurrying at the horned fence posts, Mother Kibibi won’t let herself be disturbed, and the rhinoceros will learn valuable lessons.
Although the peak of the births is over, on August 1st, a calf and two domestic goats were born.
On a warm summer day, eagles can be bathed in Kullimäe.
In the takinis, the peculiar-looking goats, the rutting season began.
On Thursday, another Vivacolor color day took place at the zoo.
A large number of good helpers painted the new camel house, the fence posts of the large yard garden of the mother elephants, and the viewing terrace of the male elephant.
In order not to disturb the painters, the female elephants Fien and Draay once again spent time with the male elephant Carl.
On August 9, the second classical Wednesday of the zoo, Aavo Ots’ trumpet ensemble will perform.
The zoo can be used to purchase mugs and other fun souvenirs with rhinos and minks.
The proceeds of charity sales will go to support the respective species conservation project.
Last week, more than 1,000 euros were raised in charity sales.
How do you know how much sugar is in your milk?
“According to the European Union food labelling standards, the amount of carbohydrates and sugars can be highlighted on the packaging, which is not equal to the amount of white, so-called table sugar,” said Krista Kalbin, Marketing Director of Valio Eesti.
According to him, there are three types of sugars in dairy products: lactose or natural milk sugar, glucose and fructose in fruits, and added sugar or sucrose.
However, if you remember a few simple basics, it should not be difficult to calculate the amount of added sugars in the product, Kalbin said.
The first step is to determine whether it is milk or fermented milk.
Conventional milk and milk drinks contain approximately 5 grams of natural milk sugar, i.e. lactose per 100 grams of product.
In fermented milk products, yogurt or kefir bacteria have consumed some lactose during the fermentation process, which means that the average lactose in fermented milk products is 3,5g/100g of product.
"To calculate the amount of added sugar, the first thing you need to do is to subtract lactose from the amount of sugar," Kalbin said.
Now, fructose and glucose from berries and fruits must be subtracted from the amount of sugars.
“As a rule, fructose and glucose flavoured milk products have about 0.3 grams in the usual 3-4% fruit content, and especially berry products with about 15% fruit content have up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams,” Kalbin said.
According to him, this simple calculation shows that the proportion of added sugar in berry yoghurts can be up to twice as low as the proportion of sugars indicated on the package.
For lactose-free products, the situation is slightly different, as the sugar content depends on the production technology.
Comparison of the most affordable spa packages: from nightclub tickets to sauna rituals
The Postimees consumer magazine compared the cheaper packages offered by the spas to one person for one night on August 11-12.
"Spa hotels have different levels and service options, so it is very difficult to compare one to one based on price alone," said Mario Sau, Sales Manager of OÜ Spa Tours.
Compared to accommodation facilities with spa facilities, it turns out that the prices of the cheapest packages differ several times and there are options for both more demanding customers and vacationers with more modest wishes.
For example, if a single passenger can spend 51 euros in Värska Spa single room with unlimited use of buffet-evening and breakfast and water park, gym and saunas, then visiting Pädaste Manor with a companion in Muhu County will cost 287 euros per person.
It includes accommodation in a Double Deluxe room, breakfast in Alexander’s winter garden and a half-day spa package.
When choosing and comparing different packages, it should be taken into account that in order to get the cheapest price, you should go on holiday with a friend or a companion, because staying in a double room is more affordable than taking a single room.
However, if you wish to rest alone, then special single rooms as well as double rooms will be offered for an additional fee.
In general, an unaccompanied passenger simply has to pay a twenty-euro surcharge for staying alone in a double room, but when making compromises, it is also possible to find cheaper options.
For example, at the Fra Mare Thalasso Spa in Haapsalu, the package costs 86 euros per night in a single room, but if you wish, you will also be offered a more affordable option to stay in a double room, provided that in case of lack of space, another person will be accommodated by informing the client in advance.
In this case, the price of the package will be 58 euros.
To get the best deal, be flexible.
Package prices are dynamic, depending on the day of the week and the fulfillment.
"For the most affordable package, prices can vary from 112 euros to 248 euros," explained Triinu Teras, Sales and Marketing Manager of V SpaaHotel in Tartu.
He also drew attention to the fact that the price in their hotels is variable depending on the occupancy rate, and added that generally the customer gets the cheapest price by booking directly on their website or asking for an offer.
Since the summer period is the fastest for spas, it is advisable to plan your holiday in time to avoid a situation where the desired place has been sold out.
For example, only suites in Pärnu Hedon Spa and Strand Spa have been selected by the time the packages were compared, and Vihula Manor in Lahemaa has also been sold out.
You don’t have to look far for opportunities to spend a relaxing holiday: almost every major Estonian city has one or even several spas.
Before buying a package, it is worth checking out whether there are any major events happening nearby, as this will immediately raise the prices.
For example, the events of the White Lady will take place in Haapsalu on August 11-13.
During this time, there are a lot of tourists in Haapsalu, the demand for accommodation is very high, and we have the prices of major events in force at that time.
"Therefore, we do not have discounted or affordable packages for sale at this time," commented Irene Väli, manager of the spa hotel Laine.
The Chinese company that came to Estonia last year made a turnover of 100 million euros
The Chinese-owned agricultural produce seller Agritera, which started its operations only last year, achieved a turnover of almost 100 million euros.
The profit was almost 2 million euros, writes Äripäev.
The company’s annual report shows that the sales revenue of Agritera OÜ, which deals with the buying-in and wholesale of agricultural products, amounted to 100.6 million euros in 2016.
The profit was 1.91 million euros.
There was no economic activity in the company a year ago.
The company employed an average of 3 people last year, and there were no employees in 2015.
The turnover per employee was 33.6 million euros, the average gross monthly salary was 316 euros.
The whole year, so you don’t need a vacation.
Of course, it was my fault for not taking the vacation.
I was probably the only one who thought I was irreplaceable.
It was my fault for having a stupid sense of duty in my chest.
The quote at the beginning of this column is good because it is absolutely true.
So it was - the new job I started in March of the same year required a lot of work, but something in this job suited me so much better that I recovered from a completely new life in three months, I rested.
It's summer, vacation time.
It's time to make New Year's resolutions, review what's happened in life, and what direction this whole thing's going to take.
"It's Christmas and New Year's!" some good citizens shout indignantly.
Maybe it is, but we all know from experience that Christmas is not a good time to think about life and set goals.
All right, all I'm saying is, I can't make any changes on New Year's Eve.
It's too hard a time for me.
Of course, there is happiness and joy in the Christmas season: I like to know about the beginning of the triumph of light, I like the Christmas lights, and Jesus was also a kind-hearted, revolutionary-minded fellow.
Despite this, I am mostly very tired and sometimes stressed at Christmas - already because of this darkness.
Yeah, I do a lot of work when I'm on vacation, maybe more than I do in some fucking slaughterhouse, and I'm pretty rested all the time.
For the most part, I have run like a squirrel on a bike before Christmas - gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a slightly higher load at work ...
If we take into account the constant pressure of society to have unconditional joy and peace in our hearts, the difficulties of the Christmas season are obvious.
But a desperate and tired person can't make good decisions, much less plan to perfect them.
Things like this need to be done with a more or less clear mind.
A tired person may throw an empty and resounding promise into the air, which will help to lay the foundation of the future as much as buying a lottery ticket.
A promise that is meant to change something should be thought through calmly, it should grow in value, it should be a plan.
The plan, unlike a promise, includes not only a goal but also a guide to action and does not break down because of a few small setbacks.
That's why I say that the best time to make promises is now, in the summer.
You just need to rest easy and figure out why it’s so tiring (if it is).
If you do not oblige yourself to struggle like a calf that escaped the barn during the holiday, then it will be enough for a couple of weeks to find some hooks in your life that deserve to be twisted straight and figure out how exactly it can be done.
I find it important to live as much as possible so that I don’t need to rest every day, not once a year.
So that the holiday would be an additional pleasure, not a pit stop necessary for survival, during which they load enough of themselves that they would somehow be able to last for the next year.
I recommend everyone at least one simple summer promise - if you need to get up at a certain time the next morning, get to bed early in the evening.
I believe that if every tenth reader of Postimees listened to my recommendation, life in Estonia would be significantly better.
I'm going to follow my own advice.
We already have a four-day work week, but not the kind we expect.
Open office.Photo: Scanpix, PantherMedia / Wavebreakmedia ltd
Many Estonians already have the desired four-day work week without their knowledge.
But not the way they expect, writes Business Day.
This has been created by modern workplace planning, i.e. open office.
According to Harvard Business Review, employees spend nearly 1.5 hours a day, or almost a full day a week, in a wallless office.
However, if the four-day work week refers to four days of work and three days of rest, then such a forced solution will be worse.
The 1.5 hours taken from working time are filled with concentration difficulties, distractions, growing irritation and anxiety, and loss of will to work, instead of spending time with family and hobbies or vacations.
The third day of the festival is accompanied by a strong wind.
Thus, a distressed seagull caught sight of the camera of Õhtuleht’s picturer, trying to fly in defiance of the wind.
Due to the windy weather, many festival visitors say that their mouths and eyes are full of sand.
How a Man Built a $51 Million Theme Park for His Daughter
A father in Texas discovered that there was no theme park where his disabled daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman had just come out of the pool on a family vacation when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan approached other children playing in the water.
He tried to befriend them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they got scared because they don't know how to treat a disabled person - Morgan has a five-year cognitive understanding as well as a certain form of autism.
This incident left him haunted.
"Morgan is a lovely young girl.
Meeting him always brings a smile to his mouth, and he undoubtedly wants to hug.
But there have been many times where we haven’t been able to take him to different places,” he says.
Hartman and his wife, Maggie, asked the other parents where they could take their daughter – somewhere where she would feel comfortable and where others would feel comfortable interacting with her.
"We came to the conclusion that there is no such inclusive place," Hartman says.
So he decided to build it himself in 2007.
A former real estate developer sold his home-building businesses in 2005 to establish The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps people with disabilities.
He then began the creation of "the world's first highly accessible theme park".
“We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do anything, where both people with special needs and people without special needs can play,” says Hartman.
He called together doctors, therapists, parents, and other disabled and non-disabled people to consult on the facility.
They were erected in a 10-hectare abandoned quarry in San Antonio, Texas.
The park, named Morgan's Wonderland, cost $34 million (£26 million) and opened in 2010.
The attractions include a fully accessible Ferris wheel, an adventurous playground, and a mini train.
Visitors often tell Hartman that they were only able to experience such attractions for the first time.
There is also a carousel with specially designed wheelchair carriages that move up and down alongside the animals.
However, Hartman admits that Morgan was initially fearful of the ride.
"When we opened it, he didn't dare go for it.
He didn’t understand why it was going around and why the animals were going up and down,” Hartman says.
It took three years for Morgan to agree to go to the merry-go-round.
"At first he just stood close to it, then he sat down on the animal, but we didn't start the race.
It was a slow process, but now he loves to ride it.
Getting over something that scared him meant a lot to him.
The little things you do make a big difference.”
Since its opening, Morgan's Wonderland has been visited by over one million people from 67 countries and all 50 states of the Americas.
A third of the staff are disabled and entry is free for anyone with any medical condition.
“I realized Morgan was one of the lucky ones because he had a lot of things he needed.
I didn't want the price to be an obstacle for other people with special needs," says Hartman.
"We open every year knowing we're going to lose at least a million dollars (£750,000) and we have to earn it back with the help of fundraisers and partners."
This year, the theme park was expanded with the opening of Morgan's Inspiration Island, a fully accessible water park.
"In July, fewer people visited the park as wheelchairs became too hot.
So we decided to set up a water park,” Hartman says.
Hot water has been used in some parts of the island to help visitors with muscle problems.
Watertight motorized wheelchairs powered by compressed air, not batteries, are available.
It is also possible to take a boat on the river.
The water park cost a total of $17 million (£13 million).
“Yesterday a man from Inspiration Island came to me and just held my hand,” Hartman says.
"He pointed to his son with serious special needs, and began to cry.
He said his son had never played in the water before.
According to Hartman, three out of every four visitors to the park are not disabled, and the park has just the effect it was hoping for.
"It helps people understand that while we're different in certain ways, we're actually exactly the same," she says.
"I saw one girl in a wheelchair go to another girl without special needs and they started playing together.
It was really awesome."
Hartman has no plans to open any more parks, although he has received hundreds of emails from people who would also like to see a park nearby.
Instead, he focuses on providing educational facilities for adolescents with special needs in San Antonio.
"I know there are many different organizations that are trying to build something like Morgan's Wonderland elsewhere, and we will continue to work with them," he adds.
He continues to take Morgan to play at the theme park - Morgan is now a kind of celebrity there.
"When he comes here, he's like a rock star!
A lot of people want to talk to him and take a picture with him, he’s handling it well,” says Hartman.
Morgan, who is now 23 years old, is getting along better.
"He's talking more now and most of his physical problems have been solved by numerous operations.
We are so proud that he has come this far."
When Morgan visits the park, he likes to play on swings and in the sand, not realizing how much he has helped others.
"Morgan knows the park is named after him, but I don't think he understands what it really represents and how it has changed lives," Hartman says.
"He doesn't realize that the way he's handled things in life has made him a real source of inspiration."
U18 head coach Vaido Rego: one or two throws may decide play-off game
The Estonian U18 basketball team defeated Poland 68:63 in the quarterfinals of the home European Championship B division, according to head coach Vaido Rego, it was a real play-off match.
The game was rough.
Both teams had done their homework, the points came hard.
The game comes down to the fact that has better nerves.
The play-off could be a one-two-shot game,” Rego said.
The coach is still looking for something to fix.
You can always complain.
Some of our mistakes were not justified, the opponent received light free throws and lived on them.
This has happened to us before - if you go aggressively to defend, there is a risk of overdoing it.
Let's draw our own conclusions," Rego said.
He used nine players today, while Robin Kivi, who missed some matches due to injury, was still on the bench.
These decisions are made on an ongoing basis.
Kivi did the morning training and pre-game warm-up, but was still not 100% ready,” explained the instructor.
At 6:15 tomorrow, Estonia will meet Great Britain in the semi-final, who defeated Bulgaria 76:73 today.
The winner of this match will raise his country's U18 senior category to the A-Division for next summer.

Four minutes before full time, the midfielder missed the penalty.
The match ended in a 1-1 draw.
Piast has scored two points in four rounds and is ranked 15th in the league table.
How to keep sex exciting when you’re trying to have a baby?
So it is very important to keep the flame of passion burning even when you are trying to create a new life.
Female First gives advice on how to make sex not seem like a tedious duty.
Don’t take it as an obligation
This can happen to any couple trying to get pregnant.
Sometimes it can take years to get pregnant.
Having sex on command takes away spontaneity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous.
Women often feel unable to enjoy "normal" sex at the end of the cycle when it is known that there will be no positive results.
This creates tension in the relationship, which in turn leads to a decrease in sex, and less sex, of course, means an even greater chance of not getting pregnant.
Men, however, feel they must be able to "represent" when required to do so.
If you know your fertile days in advance, it can help you plan something romantic with your loved one.
Whether it’s a special dinner or just spending time together – have fun!
Consider the fertile period.
From the point of view of reproduction, it makes no sense to have sex once ovulation has occurred, but in order for your relationship to flourish, try to have sex even for pleasure on non-fertile days.
While there is no evidence that pregnancy is more likely to occur if a woman has an orgasm, don’t forget it!
Remember that every couple is different.
Everyone handles baby stress differently.
Some men want to be up to date with the woman’s cycle, while others prefer not to know so they don’t feel pressured to “perform on demand.”
No one knows better than you what is best for you.
Find your solution!
Studies have shown that couples who have sex every few days have a higher success rate, but not every couple is able to maintain that density.
The most important thing is to find a pattern that suits you best as a couple.
IAAF warns that fraudsters will be watched closely at London World Cup
The World Championships in Athletics will start in London on Friday, and athletes are in more limelight than ever as a result of doping scandals.
These World Championships are the first to be guarded by a new body, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which also monitors corruption, gambling and the falsification of results.
"It cannot be ruled out that human nature does not allow such things to happen.
We can say, however, that we have the best practices and the best anti-doping program that can exist at all, based on information and data collection, and we will see the result after the event," AIU spokesman David Howman said.
The AIU has allowed 19 athletes, of the approximately 190 Russian athletes who have been caught with the drugs, to compete as neutral athletes.
Review: Levadia destroyed the Paide City Team in the home square
Levadia has put herself in a difficult position, because in the previous round, she was surprisingly lost abroad to Viljandi Tuleviku, and table leader Flora took advantage of the offered opportunity, slipping already seven points away.
From behind, however, Nõmme Kalju has reached the same level as Levadia.
Paide, who was imprisoned during the summer transition window, still misses the captain and midfielder Andre Frolov.
Of the last seven games, only two draw points have been collected, the league table ranks eighth - Tartu Tammekas is four points behind and will be four points ahead of Future.
In the first match of this year, Levadiale lost 0:7 and in the second 2:5 to Paide.
“My watch died, but I didn’t,” actor Raivo E. Tamm smiled at the Ironman 70.3 finish.
True, during the whole half-length triathlon, Raivo did not seem to leave behind a smile.
In addition, running 21.1 kilometers, he even got into a conversation: “I talked to a person while running, a man ran by and said, ‘Lord, you can talk too!’
During the run, Raivo, who had the energy to talk, switched over to a quick walk a few times.
Coach's recommendation.
"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that you can walk uphill, that there is no point in pushing to run, because there are such highs here, and in terms of time, it doesn't really matter whether you run or take a quick walk on the road," he said.
He was also able to catch his breath while he was walking, so even after crossing the finish line he was able to breathlessly share interviews to the left and right.
It's like there's no swimming, 90 kilometers of biking, and 21.1 kilometers of running.
"I think that my training will also be such that I can enjoy this competition," admits Raivo, who started training in January and has now lost 16 kilograms of body weight.
And when it comes to interviews, it was my wish to be able to give interviews after the finish.
I have been able to give interviews after every competition and I was hoping that it would be nice to do it after Otepää Ironman.
I thought that it would be all right if I wasn’t on the ground after Ironman.” In contrast to the flaring gaping ground, Raivo offered a completely different picture when crossing the finish line: hands triumphantly towards the sky and a sincere joy of victory glowing on his face.
Raivo took 46 minutes and 24 seconds to swim the 1.9 km, 3 hours and 32 minutes to cycle the 90 km, and 2 hours and 18 minutes to run the 21.1 km.
"My heart has now been given to the triathlon", Raivo confirms, who already at the finish line cried out that he gave the sport a finger and it took the ring off.
I already registered for Gran Fondo on August 20th - 230 kilometers from Tallinn to Tartu by bike!
So, practice again tomorrow!
Disney longtime advisor and CEO Marty Sklar has died at the age of 83.
Sklar, who died on July 27 at his home in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, maintained ties with the company after retiring in 2009, which was exactly timed to the 54th anniversary of Disneyland's opening.
Last year, on the opening day of Shanghai Disney in China, he became the only member of the company (so the company invites its employees) to participate in the opening of all 12 Disney parks around the world.
And less than two weeks before his death, he attended the D23 reunion of Disney fans, sharing reminiscences about Disneyland.
His death was announced by the Disney Company, without naming its cause.
He was 83 years old.
Sklar's position as editor of The Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to Disneyland after graduating from U.C.L.A. in 1956 to work in its advertising department.
He soon became Walt Disney's primary shadow author for writing promotional materials, dedications, souvenir guides, speeches, slogans, presentations, and short films, such as a piece of writing that helped the company gain approval for the construction of Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also collaborated with Walt and his brother Roy on Disney's annual reports.
"It was a pretty dizzying time for someone who was only approaching his 30th birthday and only six or seven years into college," Sklar wrote in his autobiography, Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms (2013).
However, despite trusting Sklar in his writings, Walt Disney assigned Sklar to the Ford Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair, where the Disney Company designed exhibits and attractions.
Sklar wrote a story for Walt Disney about the Ford Pavilion attraction Magic Skyway, where animatronic dinosaurs and cavemen could be seen and which served as their main link to major corporate sponsors.
This was the beginning of the second act of Sklar in the company.
As an increasingly important member and leader of Imagineers, he was increasingly associated with the legacy of Walt Disney, who died in late 1966 long before the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971 and Epcot in 1982.
After Walt Disney died of lung cancer at the age of 65, Sklar was thrown back into the writing world when he was told that the company’s executives had not prepared a public statement, even though “it was no secret that Walt was dying,” as he writes in his autobiography.
Sklar said he was "indignant" that he had to write a statement to be signed by Roy Disney, but he realized the lack of planning was a sign that Walt Disney's death had paralyzed the company's executives.
"In reality, they were all scared to death," Sklar wrote.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in February in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
His father Leon was a teacher and his mother, née Lilyn Fuchs, worked at Johnson & Johnson before moving to Long Beach, California, when Marty was 12.
After high school, he had a number of temporary jobs, including working at Douglas Aircraft, as an ice-cream picker at a hamburger restaurant drive-in, and as a mail carrier.
However, in May 1955, as his third year at U.C.L.A. was coming to an end, Sklar received a message to call Disney marketing and advertising manager E. Cardon Walker.
At the time, Sklar was the new editor-in-chief of the U.C.L.A. student newspaper The Daily Bruin.
Walker asked her to come to a job interview for the position of creator and editor of The Disneyland News.
Walker said the theme park would be opening soon.
And it needs him.
Walker hired him after a 20-minute interview.
However, Sklar also had to prove to Walt Disney that he knew what he was doing.
“I had been working there for two weeks and had to present the concept of the page to Walt Disney,” he said on Disney Avenue.
"If Walt didn't like it, he would have thrown me out the door and hired a professional.
But luckily, Walt liked it.
I was 21.
It was scary.
I’ve never worked at a professional level.”
Sklar formed the Walt Disney (and some other people's) lessons at one point into the "Miki's Ten Commandments", a manifesto for the theme park board.
Commands include: Know your target audience.
Try to "step into the visitors' shoes" to experience the attraction like them.
Tell only one story at a time for each attraction.
Bob Rogers once called Sklar a “magician’s apprentice,” a role that Mickey Mouse played in Disney’s “Fantasy” (1940), because he had mediated Disney philosophy to three generations of designers.
She is survived by her husband Leah Gerber, daughter Leslie Sklar, son Howard and four grandchildren.
Sklar was a devout Disney executive.
He regularly wore a three-seater Miki-Hiire watch (which showed him the time in Los Angeles, Paris, and Tokyo) and a Miki-Hiire gold ring.
And he never forgot anything Walt Disney had taught him.
When the Disney Company developed the California Adventure Park children's area, Sklar reminded planners to include activities that parents and children could do together, as Walt Disney had requested.
"I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed because Walt used to take his daughters Diane and Sharon to Griffith Park to ride the carousel," he told The Los Angeles Times in 2002, "and Daddy had to sit on a park bench and eat peanuts and popcorn while the kids were driving alone."
Police took more than 200 people to the station during the weekend
In total, more than 20 crimes were registered in Pärnu during the festival days.
There is reason to associate with the music festival about half of them, besides the use of violence, possession of a large amount of narcotics and two drunk driving were recorded.
The misdemeanour proceedings initiated by a hundred people were mainly related to the consumption or possession of minors or prohibited substances who had consumed alcohol.
The letter was received with some theft and a breach of public order.
Over 200 people were brought to the police station for various reasons.
About half of them were minors and alcohol was the main reason for the delivery to the police station.
More than half of the minors were brought to the station last year.
Half a hundred people were also taken to sober up, which is as much as last year.
According to Andres Sinimer, head of the Pärnu Police Station, the above numbers are expected considering the large crowd.
As in previous years, we were thoroughly prepared for this weekend.
We involved additional forces from other prefectures, police cadets and assistant police officers to ensure readiness to respond quickly.
Most situations were solved with a word and it was enough for law enforcement to communicate with citizens.
“Obviously there were quite a few misdemeanors, because the police could be seen and felt enough in the city according to our estimation,” Sinimeri said.
In his opinion, it was extremely positive that minors who had consumed alcohol were visibly fewer and the young people proved that they could party soberly.
He praised the top-level team of the security company that took care of security in the festival area.
I would like to thank all the festival guests who behaved themselves politely and celebrated safely.
"I would also like to thank the local residents, who with their understanding contributed to the success of the festival," he said.
The owners of Pärnu Police Station are waiting for the items found in the city and festival area.
According to Annika Pärn, the Pärnu Service Manager responsible for returning the finds in the festival area, fewer items were lost this year than last year.
More than half of the findings were returned to the owners.
The greatest number of bank cards, identity documents, mobile phones and keys were lost in three days.
"At the moment, 13 mobile phones, three wallets, a laptop, a smart watch and several car keys are waiting for the owner of the station," Pärna said.
A 101-year-old man jumped from a plane.
World War II veteran Verdun Hayes recently received a military award to celebrate his world record-breaking parachute jump.
At the age of 101 years and 38 days, he performed a feat, becoming the oldest person in the world to make a parachute jump.
Business group urges government to agree on Brexit transition conditions
One of Britain’s largest business lobby groups is urging the government to stop dancing around the Brexit fringes.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) appealed to the government to come up with a "transition agreement" to make progress on Brexit smooth.
They want the government to bridge the "Brexit gap" between leaving the EU and building new trade deals.
The group warned that without such a contract, the business would face "short-term chaotic rock edge fluctuations".
They criticized the government for engaging in "all kinds of speculative disputes" over the transition.
In recent weeks, members of the government have presented conflicting views on how long the transition period will last and what it will entail.
The IoD’s report, “Brexit Bridging the Gap – Options for a Transition,” states: “Instead of feeling the problem from afar, the government needs to create a strategic debate around the issue.
This could minimise the growing confusion and uncertainty in this area."
Gerard Lyons, an economist and leading figure in the group Economists for Brexit, this week described the concern over a “rock-edged” Brexit as a “panic-makers’ tale” reminiscent of Y2K’s computer programming flaw fear at the turn of the millennium.
Early Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in June: "There is a large amount of business investment that will be postponed until companies see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions will be."
Allie Renison, head of EU and trade policy at the IoD, said: "The chancellor has every right to worry about delayed business investments.
This is one of the most frequently considered changes in the context of Brexit, alongside the relocation of operations to the EU.
The latter is particularly true for members of the IoD in Northern Ireland who are currently considering co-location or relocation."
The IoD offers a number of options, including the following:
Joining the European Economic Area
Acceptance to remain under EU law for longer
Creation of a transitional customs agreement similar to the EU Customs Union
Renison said: "The IoD suggested these options in relation to the transition, hoping it would spark a proper debate on how best to complete Brexit.
Prioritising the interim arrangements and thereby mitigating the risks of exiting the EU means that short-term chaotic cliff edge fluctuations will not reduce future opportunities.”
Russian Railways Investigating the Possibility of a St. Petersburg-Kaliningrad-Berlin Passenger Train
Russian railways are investigating the possibility of launching a Berlin-St. Petersburg train route via Kaliningrad, said Viktor Golomolzin, the director of the Kaliningrad railway Interfax to Severo-Zapad.
The monitoring of passenger traffic speaks of the fact that from an economic point of view it is hardly possible to restart the Kaliningrad-Berlin trains.
And we offer another route - Berlin-Kaliningrad-St. Petersburg.
There are technical possibilities for this in terms of both infrastructure and rolling stock," Golomolzin said.
Golomolzin further noted that there are already Russian trains on which it is possible to change track and continue to move on the European track.
Golomolzin thinks that this direction is promising, because at present the residents of St. Petersburg and all of the northwestern part of Russia have to travel to Germany through Moscow and Brest.
Māris Ozols, a spokesman for Latvian Railways (Latvijas Dzelzcelš), confirmed that the route will be discussed via Latvia, according to whom there is currently no specific decision, but the option is under discussion.
Together with its partners, including Russian railways, Latvian railways are looking for ways to increase their competitiveness in servicing passenger flows so that rail transport can compete with road transport.
Pakistan's Hindus find no refuge in India
70 years after the separation of the two countries, Hindus are still moving from Pakistan to India.
Tens of thousands of people who do not even have the legal right to work in India are already waiting for them in the rickety camps on the border of the two countries.
Thus, many have no choice but to illegally raid temporary settlements near the quarry - the Indian authorities are watching the movements of those coming from the other side of the border very closely.
The majority of Pakistanis do not expect such a reception.
No job, no house, no money, no food.
There we worked in the fields, we were peasants.
Here, people like us are forced to break stones to make a living,” said Jogdas, 81.
For us, the split is not over.
The Hindus are still trying to return to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing," added an elderly man living in a field camp near the town of Jodhpur.
Following India's independence from British colonial rule in 1947, more than 15 million people lost their homes.
The separation caused months of violence in which at least one million people lost their lives as a result of religious hatred.
In the midst of bloody chaos, Hindus and Sikhs fled the newly formed Pakistan, while Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite the emigration, Hindus remain one of Pakistan's most numerous minority groups.
According to various estimates, they make up about 1.6 percent of the country's 200-million population.
Many of them complain of constant discrimination and fear abduction, rape and forced marriages.
"The persecution began shortly after secession," said Jogdas, whose family moved to Pakistan just a few months before the two countries split to escape the drought.
Not a day went by that we could live in peace.
I wanted to come back to live among my Hindu brothers.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has said it wants to make it easier for religiously persecuted people to find refuge in India.
Last year, the government started to allow immigrants to apply for citizenship at their place of residence; previously, all business was conducted through the central government.
Hindus relocated from Pakistan to India will have the opportunity to become fast-track citizens after seven years of living in the country.
However, due to bureaucratic delays, this process is often much more time-consuming.
Khanaramji, 64, left Pakistan in 1997 and gained Indian citizenship in 2005.
However, many have given up and returned to Pakistan because they see that a good life does not await them in India.
The government does not provide any support.
We're like cattle without an owner.
Just trying to survive on our own," Khanaramji said.
But even worse than poverty is the scepticism of the authorities.
Those who do not have citizenship will have to suffer harassment from intelligence agencies.
They are constantly being treated as suspects and agents of Pakistan,” he said.
Singh Sodhal, the founder of a charity dedicated to helping Hindus in Jodhpur, Pakistan, had high hopes for Modi, who came to power in 2014, but has since been disappointed.
Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated during Modi's rule, with migrants suffering the most as a result.
"Their lives are going to hell," Sodhal said.
For many, however, this treatment is better than life in Pakistan.
Horoji fled to India two years ago after receiving death threats from his Pakistani neighbors.
"To save our lives, we had to flee to India," said Horoji, 65, whose grandparents came from what is now India, but found themselves on the wrong side of the border as the country split.
My grandfather moved to the other side for work.
But he told us to move to India at the right moment because he knew the future would be dangerous for the Hindus.
I think we've done pretty well.
We have done well in our work and activities”, says Andres Sinimeri, the Police Manager of Pärnu, how the first two days of the Weekend have gone smoothly for them.
Sinimeri says that even today, patrol policemen and rapid responders are on the streets and also communicate with people - perhaps they have questions and also want to know how to become a rapid responder.
Over the course of two days, the police have had to deal with some fights as well as drug cases.
"There have also been some handling of a large amount of narcotics, but we will make conclusions when the weekend is over," Sinimeri says.
About a hundred people have passed through the Pärnu Police Station in two days.
Fortunately, the police did not have to deal with the incident.
By the way, Sinimeri says that when it rains sharply and horizontally from the sky, they don’t have much work to do.
One of the leaders of the Haapsalu Police Department once said that rain is like an extra patrol.
The Pärnu police have also made a staff in the Weekend area, where you can take the found items and from there you can also claim your lost items.
By the way, the police even lost one of their necessary gadgets, which the good people delivered to the finding point.
Watch the video that Andres Sinimeri told Õhtuleht.
Emmy-nominated screenwriter and producer Neal Baer paid $4.35 million for a home in Hollywood Hills West that traces its roots to the atomic age.
This mid-century modernist-style house was designed in 1945 by Josef Van der Kar and named the Wohlstetter House after its original owners, nuclear weapons strategists Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter.
The 255-square-metre house, located by the entryway, is surrounded by gates and has wide glass sliding doors that open into the garden, terrace and courtyard.
The living and dining room has cork flooring, a fireplace and portable panels that open into the kitchen.
The main part of the house consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
There is also a separate guest house with views of the giant fish pond and the sleeping porch.
The separate building also has a bathroom and additional storage space.
Albert Wohlstetter was an influential nuclear strategist during the Cold War.
Roberta Wohlstetter's analysis of intelligence mishaps prior to the Pearl Harbor attack was also cited by the 9/11 Commission of Inquiry.
The Wohlstetters have advised both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations, including John F. Kennedy, during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
They received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan in 1985.
Baer is best known for his work in the television dramas "The Emergency Hospital" and "In the Name of the Law: The Sexual Offences Investigation Unit".
The real estate brokers were Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane of the company Deasy/Penner and Partners.
The buyer was represented by Hattie Ramirez of Keller Williams Realty.
The plane drew the perfect image of itself over the United States
The pilot took the passenger plane on a zigzag nationwide flight over the United States and was even able to have some fun along the way.
The real-time flight path data of the aircraft indicated that it was not just a straight line or an arc, but a sequence of flight paths that combined to form the image of the aircraft.
Flight BOE004 departed from Boeing Field Airport in Seattle at approximately 3:40 p.m. on Wednesday, according to real-time flight tracking data.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took a heading east over Montana, North Dakota, and Minnesota before abruptly changing course and flying southwest.
Viewed from a map, the plane's strange route depicts a two-engined passenger plane.
According to Boeing, the flight is part of the aircraft's 18-hour "endurance" test.
"Instead of flying in random patterns, the testing team unleashed their imagination by driving a route that formed the 787-8 contour over 22 states," a Boeing Company spokesman told RT.com.
"The Dreamliner's nose points to the Puget Sound area where the home of Boeing Commercial Airplanes is located.
The wings range from northern Michigan near the Canadian border to southern Texas.
The tail touches Huntsville, Alabama," he added.
Boeing’s 787-8 Dreamliner was launched in 2009.
The aircraft can carry up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 13,600 kilometers.
As the pilot used the radar as a personal canvas, the flight generated enormous interest among the aircraft watchers online.
Some suspected it was a test flight, while others suggested it might be a strange coincidence.
Estonian children’s clothing style is influenced by cartoons
While in Europe and America children’s fashion is often shaped by what the children of royal families or celebrities wear, Estonian parents choose their children’s clothes based on what is happening on the screen.
Prince George is becoming a fashion guru, following the example of his mother, Duchess Cahterine.
Like her mother, Prince George is able to unleash a real shopping frenzy in people with his clothes, which has even become a concept in its own right – the Prince George Effect.
The last such event took place a few weeks ago during a royal family visit to Poland, where George wore a blue-red striped shirt worth ten euros at the Spanish brand Tizza, which was bought by his deranged parents in the brand’s online store within 24 hours.
There were probably not many shoppers from Estonia, because the clothes of the king’s children are said to leave our parents completely cold.
Anna Ansmitt, Head of Communication at Kaubamaja, admits that the children of star couples and foreign fashion trends generally do not affect the purchases of our parents for their toddlers.
In Estonia, films, cartoons and also Youtube channels are the biggest trendsetters in the purchase of children’s goods.
So the most popular products of recent years are finger spinners, games with characters of the cartoon "Frozen", dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, hatching penguins and so on".
At the same time, she confirms that, if she wishes, her children in Estonia can be dressed in the same way as princes or princesses in Europe.
The Centre Party does not recommend Savisaar’s ready-made alliance
The Centre Party regional leaders from all over Estonia made an appeal to the public and their party members to vote for the Centre Party, not the election coalitions.
Above all, this message is meant for those who are considering between Edgar Savisaar’s election coalition and the Centre Party.
How Princess Diana used her makeup as a weapon
When I think of Princess Diana’s makeup, the first thing that comes to mind is the eyeliner.
At a young age, the girlish blue.
Later in an interview with Martin Bashir’s Panorama, the effect of which was devastating when he looked up through the thick lashes, uttering the immortal phrase: “There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit too crowded.”
His large, wet eyes, surrounded by his flatness, pale face with a thick black line, made him look like a wounded animal.
This is exactly the effect he was trying to achieve.
Outside of the public eye, Princess Diana never wore much makeup, at least not by modern standards.
It was not only that she did not need it - she was naturally beautiful - but she saw in it an annoying duty, something to do with work rather than pleasure.
In front of the public, he could wear a thick layer of makeup.
Once he arrived at Conde Nast, Vogue's publishers' office, wearing a thick, almost orange layer of foundation.
He apologized, saying that his skin had to shine like it was the sun, because if he went out "normally", the tabloid photographers would take pictures of him and then make all the accusations that he looked "pale", "dumb" and "tired".
It was for this reason that Diana went to the solarium three times a week using her home-made machine.
Today, of course, such a course of action would be resented for health reasons, but for Diana it had a useful purpose - it allowed her to show the world her sunny nature, even though her interior was filled with black clouds and thunder.
One of the royal family’s biggest mistakes was to think that if they accepted her as Charles’s wife, they would get a beautiful little brood with nothing but cotton candy as their brain.
But the reality was quite the opposite.
He may not have been the best in class at school, but when it came to creating an image, he was a thoroughly five-year-old student.
For Diana, the importance of hair and makeup was that they could be used to convey a mood or feeling.
Otherwise, they were of no interest to him.
His friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was the godmother of his youngest child - remembers that makeup was not something they used to talk about.
"I just remember," he said, "how relieved he felt the times we went on vacation together and he didn't have to put on makeup."
Today, we tend to think of makeup as something that enhances a woman’s appearance, but looking back on Diana’s life, it’s clear that she used it as a powerful communication tool.
The moments when he felt most at ease were the moments when he was also the most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, with her two young sons in Thorpe Park at the Loggers Leap attraction, she was soaking wet and laughed heartily, with mascara under her eyes like any other mother who spends the day with her children.
Four months after the announcement of her and Charles' separation, she finally looked defiantly carefree and "conventional."
Or, in later years, hurling out of the gym, putting her hair behind her, wearing her legs in her cycling pants, reddening her face from her workout, blowing her health and vitality from every pore.
Towards the end of her life, as she began to assert her independence and her confidence grew, we saw more and more of this Diana.
He became involved with the Halo Trust and walked through the Angolan minefield in January 1997.
At the age of 35, her hair soft and natural, her face almost completely makeup-free, she probably looked more beautiful than ever, reminiscent of the bright and hopeful young girl who smiled in her engagement photo 15 years ago.
Diana was just getting into her best years.
In his early days, young Diana Spencer had a dreamlike pre-Raffael nature.
But it wasn’t long before “princessification” began – a process conducted primarily by the press and palace to make Diana a refined young lady worthy of her new position.
Partly this included the handiwork of Clayton Howard, a veteran makeup artist who Lord Snowdon often used in photo sessions.
Howard first met the fearsome Diana at Snowdon’s Kensington townhouse to capture an official engagement photo for Vogue magazine.
At that point, in the late 1980s, Diana was still a blank canvas.
Her finest beauty products came from The Body Shop, such as Elderflower Eye Gel.
Howard used the Max Factor foundation Sheer Genius in Honey Touch and Max Factor in Frosted Coral.
She wore Elizabeth Arden shades of Rice and Timberland on her eyelids, and an eye shadow with a white frosting effect on her eyebrows.
The look was enhanced by Elizabeth Arden’s blue mascara and blue contour pencil.
And we know all this because Howard created a facial circuitry for her.
“Diana’s eyes are so admirable in color that I wanted to emphasize their striking blueness,” she wrote.
The end result, however, is not particularly flattering for such a young girl - she looks like an 18-year-old who is about to turn 50.
Her eyebrows are too oppressive and too much dull brown applied to her eyes.
But the most striking thing here is the infamous eyeliner on the inner edge of the eyelid in that ghostly Disney princess blue hue.
A fantasy for a fantasy bride.
No wonder Diana's looking at us a little insecure.
One source of Diana's anguish was the fact that she never knew where the public persona would end and the private one would begin.
That was the beginning of this process.
The person who most likely influenced Diana’s appearance was Mary Greenwell, who still plays an important role in today’s makeup world.
The makeup artist, who is currently Chanel’s ambassador among others, is still one of the makeup world icons.
"Diana had incredibly beautiful skin and long limbs," he recalls.
"She was just beautiful.
The men adored him.
She was sexy without catching it."
Mary first met Diana in 1991 when Vogue’s then head stylist, Anna Harvey, asked her to do makeup for Diana before a December issue photo session with Patrick Demarchelier, one of the magazine’s most respected photographers.
The team also included hairdresser Sam McKnight.
This was when Diana and Charles' marriage troubles were at their greatest, and quarrels began in the name of public support.
"They didn't tell us who it was, even though we knew it was someone very famous," Greenwell said.
“When we got there, Diana was just standing there, warm and friendly, and excited to be on the cover of Vogue.”
This cover - Diana in a simple black sweater, her chin resting on her hands, her blue eyes bright, the elegant French manicure on the nails, her hair cut short - was groundbreaking.
It radiated positivity, individuality and elegance.
Above all, it was contemporary, conveying the sleek minimalist aesthetic of the early nineties and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the royal family facing an "annus horribilis", as the Queen would later call it.
"Diana was very relaxed about her makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and different," said Greenwell.
Over time, she taught Diana to make her own makeup - cream, make-up cream, concealer for lifting eyes, mascara - and emphasized a healthy skin care routine, encouraging her to take good care of herself and follow the mantra "inner beauty".
Diana “did everything in moderation,” Greenwell says.
He slept enough and reduced alcohol consumption, which is very important for fresh-looking skin.
The princess preferred Guerlain make-up cream, Clarins lipstick, and Clinique's Wild Rose blush.
But the greatest favor Mary did to Diana was to wean her from the blue eyeliner.
"It just made him so much older," he said.
Instead, he used a combination of soft brown and neutral tones with a brown pencil line on the lash border that were fused together so that all the edges were beautifully soft.
She often used just a toning cream and a little sun powder to emphasize Diana’s healthy glow.
“Diana used to call me and invite me over to discuss products that I loved to do,” Greenwell told me.
"I think it was relaxing for him; an opportunity to take a few moments for himself."
Her favorite was the luxury brand Clarins.
Diana allegedly used a day and night cream for their sensitive skin and a cleansing milk and toner with these Alpine herbs.
She also regularly attended the beauty salon of cosmetician Janet Filderman in Central London.
Diana had famously beautiful skin, but sometimes she had rosacea, a moderate side effect that is often caused by stress.
To alleviate this, he used natural soothing oils, including rose hip oil.
"Diana had an amazing bone structure," Greenwell said.
The only part of his appearance he wasn't very confident about was his nose.
Anna Harvey recalls, "Once, when the newspapers wrote that she had been going for a beauty surgery, she turned to me and, laughing, said, 'Honestly, if I had had my nose operated, do you think I would have chosen one then?'"
As the advice of Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight became entrenched, Diana felt increasingly confident in her new look.
One of her most memorable public appearances, in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where she wore the famous “revenge dress”, a provocative, bare-shouldered replica of her figure by Christina Stambolian, shows that a signature style began to emerge in her late years.
With short hair combed behind the ears, Diana is sexy and dynamic at the same time, her short hairstyle in sharp contrast with a very challenging black silk dress.
Her makeup is perfect - a flattering, yet modest, black eyeliner accentuating the blueness of her eyes.
Unafraid of bright colors, especially red, he wore glossy fiery-red nail polish, quite possibly Revlon Red, which then became a trademark in some ways.
A few months later, he flashed his elegant red manicure at the launch of a child-loss fund at the Royal College of Nursing.
The princess was a model of health and self-confidence.
He also had complete control.
Tanned and fit, her make-up flawless, she conveys exactly what she wants viewers to think: here is a woman who seems to finally have a sense of herself and a purpose in life, and who has finally found her place, having just turned 36.
It's a real shame he couldn't prove it to himself.
Japan is preparing for the arrival of Typhoon Noru
Much of southwest Japan, including areas devastated by heavy rain last month, was preparing for even more rain on Friday as Typhoon Noru, which at one point this year was the world's strongest storm, moved closer and closer to the country's main islands.
According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the Amami archipelago, located just south of Kyushu Island and about 1,350 km from Tokyo, will be hit by strong winds and heavy rainfall on Friday afternoon, with the possibility of up to 800 mm of rainfall over the next 48 hours.
A spokesman for the Bureau of Meteorology said that Noru, which designates a type of deer in Korean, would then likely turn north and shower rain over Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which were hit by torrential rains and floods last month, which killed 36 people and left four missing, will likely escape the worst.
"This is an extremely slow-moving storm," he added, noting that there is a greater risk of flooding as it is raining heavily in one area over an extended period of time.
Noru, which at one point was a Category 5 typhoon and is an unusually long-lived storm, first formed two weeks ago and roamed the North Pacific before heading northwest, targeting Japan and weakening its approach route.
The representative added that, depending on the change of course, Noru could go through the torrents directly across Kyushu and then along the Japanese island of Honshu, but the longer journey is still difficult to determine.
There are places on the landscape where you can’t get to with conventional vehicles even if you want them best.
That's the solution to ATVs.
ATVs that are used in the military sphere gave an overview of Kaitse Kodu!
The use of such lightweight and high-permeability vehicles in military structures is nothing new.
The need for them arose already during World War II, but more attention was paid to them a decade later.
Simplicity and strength
As early as 1956, Willys rolled out of Overland’s factories the M-274, a further development of a vehicle designed for the evacuation of the wounded at the end of World War II.
It's a little strange to call a mechanical mule an extension.
It is hard to imagine a more ascetic vehicle.
Wheeled platform, seat and steering wheel: everything, all the luxury.
It was as if overzealous constructors had stolen the drawings from the engineer’s desk too hastily and started production quickly.
However, in war, the permeability is much more important than comfort.
In this category, there was no opponent of a mule tested in the jungles of Vietnam.
The light machine, weighing less than five hundred kilograms, was barely accessible to those places where Willys Jeep, who had accumulated mythological fame with his superpermeability, had to show the brake lights submissively.
The majority of vehicles with a load-bearing capacity of nearly 500 kg were used for transport work, both for the carriage of supplies and manpower.
At other times, lighter, recoilless anti-tank weapons were also mounted on the mule.
However, such a truck came under fire, and it still happened that the driver, in his last trouble, was able to move the steering system forward and lower it so much that it was possible to drive the vehicle lying on his stomach.
The mules were produced until 1970, a total of 11,240 were completed and were in service with the army until 1980, when they were replaced by the victorious HMMWVs.
For the next two decades, ATVs had rather marginal meaning in military circles.
They came back to the picture after twin towers fell in New York City and U.S. soldiers found themselves fighting in the desert landscapes of Iraq and Afghanistan.
It was there that the knowledge and understanding was born that something was needed that would fill the gap between Humwee and the infantryman.
Since ATVs generally do not offer considerable protection, they are not the best choice for direct combat tasks.
However, fast and lightweight machines are suitable for special tasks.
For example, in reconnaissance and rescue operations.
There are currently thousands of ATVs and UTVs in use in the American military.
Most of them, like the XUV550d purchased for the Defence League, are essentially similar to those in civilian use, but supplemented according to the needs of the army.
The camouflaged brands include such names as Kawasaki Mule, Hondalt Rancher and Foreman, Yamahalt Rhino and Arctic Cat, and an ever-expanding range of Polaris models from the leading military ATVs manufacturer.
In 2013, Polaris signed a five-year contract with the American Special Forces Center (SOCOM) for the delivery of two-seater MRZR2 and MRZR4 and a separate five-year contract for single-seat Polaris Sportsman-based MV850s, featuring both infrared and black-out lights and innovative beehive-like tires that provide mobility even after a hit from a 50-caliber gun.
Before the MV850 entered the market, Polaris was able to supply the military with the MV700 and MV800 vehicles.
The MV700 is a militarized version of the Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman made for civilian use, with front and rear winches, a two-piece fuel tank for longer distances, a reinforced frame and bottom, and some additional military equipment that farmers or forest hatters don’t have much to do with.
Like the John Deere M-Gators successfully used in both Iraq and Afghanistan, Polaris ATVs are equipped with gun support, luggage racks on the bonnet and some other elements that are useless in the ranches but necessary in the combat zone.
A 750-pound vehicle can carry almost its own weight, or more accurately, 570 kilos of stuff.
The engine power is also sufficient for carrying lighter afters and artillery parts.
The shape-shifting box at the rear, with detachable sides, allows you to carry from point A to point B baggage that is even larger than this small but persistent insect.
Later, the upgraded versions of the M-Gator also produced the A1, which is 20 horsepower more powerful than the original 20-horsepower M-Gator, followed by the reinforced frame A2, which is even better for carrying and towing weights, and the A3, which combines the positive features of the A1 and A2.
Fire crosses were actually received by M-Gators as early as 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia, where they were used by medical brigades to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they also reduced the burden on soldiers on their own feet, carrying instead stuff that would otherwise have had to be carried on their backs.
While most ATVs used in power structures are modifications of vehicles used for civil purposes, there are a few exceptions.
The most prominent of these are the Prowler warhorses made at Phoenix International, which have been successfully used in all kinds of combat, reconnaissance and rescue missions around the world.
According to the manufacturer, these vehicles, introduced for the first time ten years ago and designed for special operations, have overcome the bottlenecks that are characteristic of conventionally used ATVs, as well as those that have been modified for the Army, in terms of handling, durability and safety.
Although similar in construction and size to a conventional ATV, Prowler is completely different in terms of both construction and performance.
It is faster, more durable, more stable and can both carry and carry heavier loads than other similar vehicles.
For example, if in the case of a conventional ATV, in order to maintain the balance of the vehicle, the driver must constantly play with his body position and use both hands to maneuver, accelerate and brake, then driving a Prowler is more like driving a car.
But in the end, it doesn’t matter whether Prowler, Gator, MV850 or any other ATV or UTV concept and application is the same.
And it is clear that in a situation where defence spending is largely reduced and smaller-scale, target-oriented skimming is practiced instead of large-scale conventional warfare, light-weight and fast light vehicles have joined the army in order to remain in service.
The department has published sensitive data on vulnerable children in care.
As a result of a worrying breach of information, the mother of one of the children was sent the personal data of the children under mistaken care, including information on whether they are sexually active.
A table was sent to the mother by e-mail containing the names, dates of birth, locations and specific concerns and points of interest for all children in the care of a large provider in Victoria.
The email revealed every child's place of residence.
The list states that a 13-year-old boy has been released on bail, and that sexual behavior in his case manifests itself, that a 15-year-old girl who has problems with self-harm, abuse of certain substances and running away is "out with a boyfriend" and "will not return tonight", and that one 14-year-old boy needs help "taking care of himself" and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The table appears to be a handover document designed to be sent to the night shift supervisor.
The document contains notes on when to expect a child home, or whether they can contact staff to pick them up.
An alarming number of details have been provided about some of the children.
For a 15-year-old boy, a warning has been written: "If personnel contact to obtain permission to search the room and/or review a laptop/USB device due to suspicion of inappropriate sexual material, this permission must be granted."
The document also reports that a 17-year-old girl, who turns 18 in just three months and is released from a nursing home, is at such risk of suicide that staff have to call the emergency line immediately if she escapes.
The 16-year-old paroled boy was reported to be out and "will contact the staff later to follow him".
Although only the name of the accommodation unit where the children are kept is mentioned for the listed locations, and not their addresses, there are still enough details to be found.
A 2015 data breach came about when a mother shared her experience with Fairfax Media on health and child welfare since taking her daughter into custody four years ago.
She agreed to share her concerns now that her daughter had turned 18 and left the system.
The heart-wrenching decision to turn over one’s daughter to child welfare was made after a violent incident at home, one of the growing number of family violence complaints parents make against their children.
This had alarming consequences that a mother could never have foreseen. For example, within six months of leaving home, her daughter was able to face seven criminal charges, she was moved hundreds of kilometers to a home and environment where she seemed to cope successfully, but then she was moved back without informing her parents, in addition, her daughter’s caretakers accepted and facilitated two relationships between her daughter and an older man.
The relationship with the first of these boyfriends, a 17-year-old with whom the welfare authorities allowed her then 15-year-old daughter to stay regularly in a local hotel, ended when a young man was charged with having sex with a child a few days after turning 18.
"Why did he get out of the system in a worse situation than when he entered it?" she asked.
"And will this happen to all the children in custody?"
He is a vocal advocate for the creation of an institution that would allow the Ministry of Health and Services to monitor children in the first weeks after they are placed in their care before they are moved into their homes.
This would allow them to better understand how children interact with others and the risks and needs associated with them, especially educationally.
The state government is looking for new ways to reduce the need to place children in home care, including by trying to better support their parents.
Funded with $62 million over four years, the program aims to help children be transferred from home care to better-arranged situations.
In addition, the $5.6 million two-year experiment, which was unveiled last October, allows professional caregivers to provide at least 28 children to help them get out of care or avoid getting into it.
According to a departmental spokesman, the information leak was not officially reported when it happened, although the mother claims to have informed two department employees within a few months of the incident.
The department is now working with a service provider to analyze the case.
"Any alleged leak of private data will be taken very seriously. We will work to ensure that it has not negatively affected the young people involved."
Last July, Jenny Mikakos, the Minister for Families and Children, ordered an independent review of a sample of child protection privacy incidents over a five-year period.
The department accepted the resulting seven recommendations and has since updated the Child Protection Guide to ensure that staff clearly understand their roles and privacy practices, changed IT systems to ban the automated aggregation of certain personal information, and formally reviewed the department's privacy-related operations.
Australia's Commonwealth Bank accused of money laundering
The Australian government on Thursday charged Commonwealth Bank, the country's largest mortgage lender, with widespread violations of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing rules.
The financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC disclosed that they had initiated civil sentencing proceedings in federal court against CommBank due to "serious and systematic non-compliance" in Australia's largest case of its kind and the first such case in which a large bank is accused.
"CommBank's conduct in this matter has left Australian society defenseless against serious and ongoing financial crime," AUSTRAC said in a court document.
In a statement, Commonwealth Bank said it would investigate the allegations and respond "when the time is right".
Australia's largest mortgage lender did not report "at the right time or not at all" any suspicious circumstances "concerning transactions totalling more than Australian $77 million (US$61 million)," AUSTRAC said in a statement.
According to the Agency, the Bank has committed 53 700 infringements of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing acts, in particular in relation to the so-called ‘intelligent cash-in machines’.
The previous largest case of this type involved Tabcorp Holdings, Australia's most popular bookmaker earlier this year, which had only 108 alleged violations.
Tabcorp paid $45 million in fines and is the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history.
AUSTRAC declined to comment on CommBank's possible punishment or whether other banks may be in the agency's line of fire.
The maximum penalty for a breach of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing law is 18 million Australian dollars per breach.
Smart deposit machines are a specific type of ATM that accept deposits in the form of cash or cheques and facilitate anonymous deposits of cash.
According to AUSTRAC, the use of CommBank intelligent deposit machines has increased significantly since their introduction in May 2012.
Cash deposits amounted to 5.8 billion Australian dollars in the six months prior to June 2016, compared to 89 million Australian dollars in the first six months after CommBank introduced ATMs.
AUSTRAC claims in court documents that cash deposits were made under fake names, so the proceeds came from syndicates importing drugs.
"Even after CommBank's attention was drawn to suspected money laundering or 'smurfing' on Commbank accounts, CommBank did not begin monitoring its customers to complicate and manage money laundering and terrorist financing," court documents show.
AUSTRAC added that CommBank accounts were also used for "smuggling", a form of money laundering that involves transfers between countries without actually having to cross international borders.
Nordea and DNB will become a reality at the end of the year
The merger of DNB and Nordea Baltic entities into Luminor will take place only in the last quarter of this year, Äripäev writes.
The opening of doors in the common legal body has been postponed.
After the disclosure of the merger plans last summer, the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter.
However, in April, DNB's communications manager said it would be delayed to the third quarter.
Notably, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority gave Luminor additional instructions to comply with the regional importance of the Verbundbank.
Trump calls New Hampshire 'narcourka', angering state politicians
"The president is wrong," New Hampshire Republican Governor Chris Sununu said.
Disappointed that his misstatement about the epidemic ignores all the great things the state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, called the remarks "disgusting" and said on Twitter that her state is "in no way different from others that struggle with widespread opioid abuse."
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, also a Democrat, agreed.
“It’s completely unacceptable for the president to talk about NH this way,” he tweeted.
This is a completely false depiction of NH and the epidemic.
Opioid addiction - a category of drugs that includes heroin and fentanyl - is the most deadly drug epidemic in American history.
Drug overdose killed more people in 2016 than guns or car accidents - an estimated 59,000 according to data analyzed by The New York Times - and is now the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50.
In 2015, more than 97 million people in the United States consumed prescription painkillers, according to the Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health.
An estimated 12 million of these people did so in a way that was not prescribed by a doctor.
New Hampshire has been hit hard, and its residents repeatedly raised the issue with presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign.
New Hampshire had an estimated 470 overdose deaths in 2016, compared with 439 in 2015.
In 2012, according to statistics from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, there were 163.
On Thursday, Sununu described the opioid epidemic in the email as "one of the worst health crises the state has ever faced".
He said the government has doubled resources devoted to prevention, treatment and recovery.
He said the state has also spent millions of dollars on child prevention programs, law enforcement to stop drug trafficking, and initiatives to make naloxone more accessible for treatment in case of overdose.
Call to find drivers in connection with two rapes of a girl in Witton
Police are trying to find two drivers in connection with the rape investigation of a 14-year-old girl.
Teenagers were attacked in the Witton area of Birmingham on July 26 around 02:00 (BST).
Before this attack, she was raped at Witton Station.
In connection with the first case, a man has been charged.
British Transport Police want to speak to two drivers as part of the investigation.
According to police, the first car is a brightly colored sedan.
Detective Chief Inspector Tony Fitzpatrick said: "We have reason to believe that the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim at the station before being picked up by another person and then raped in the car.
We would like to know what was said during this conversation, and the driver may also know important details that would help us with the investigation."
The driver of the second vehicle, which was reportedly a red VW Sharan, reportedly took the victim home probably after she had been raped a second time, according to police.

Why Do Dogs Eat Grass?
It is sometimes thought that dogs eat grass when they are not feeling well and want to vomit.
In fact, most dogs that eat grass are perfectly healthy.
Fewer than 10 percent of dogs that nibble on grass do so because of a disease.
One reason a dog may suddenly start eating grass is poor nutrition.
Dogs with worms may also become more interested in chewing the grass.
Therefore, if a dog who has never chewed grass before has suddenly developed an appetite for grass and eats it frequently, it is advisable to go to the doctor for a check-up just in case, for example, to quickly find out about a possible problem with the digestive system.
It is worth mentioning that a dog can eat grass also because he likes the taste of it or he is just bored.
If a health problem has been ruled out, it is worth making sure that the family favorite is still getting enough developmental and spirited activity.
From the west come thunder clouds.
In Northern Estonia, we have heard thunder and seen isolated flashes.
This afternoon, the weather service also issued a thunderstorm warning.
Today, it is mainly in the north of Estonia.
The storm clouds move rapidly from west to east.
"Early wind gusts range from inland to 15, on islands and along the coast at 18 m/s, but thunderstorms may result in stronger winds," according to the weather service's website.
A much larger thunderstorm rages in southeastern Finland and Russia east of St. Petersburg.
Fortunately, the winds in Estonia are blowing from the west and southwest, which is why there is no risk of major storms turning on Estonia at least initially.
Sylvester Stallone to star in second season of 'Our Life'
Dan Fogelman, executive producer, announced Thursday during a press tour of the Television Critics Association that Sylvester Stallone would be appearing in the second season of NBC's popular drama series.
Kevin (Justin Hartley) is the co-star of the film at the beginning of the season.
"Kevin is playing in a big movie and we needed a big co-star," Fogelman said.
At the end of last season, Kevin was hired to play a major role in a feature film directed by Ron Howard.
This season we see how the character is involved in the project and also warms up the relationship with her ex, played by Alexandra Breckenridge.
According to Fogelman, Stallone "plays a father figure in the film in which Kevin is involved".
"Our Life" star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Hartley's father in the series' past pictures, played Stallone's son as a coincidence in the 2006 film Rocky Balboa.
Fogelman said Ventimiglia's still-blooming friendship with Stallone was probably what helped attract the series' big star as a guest actor.
"We have a great script for him.
I think it's going to be really exciting," Fogelman said.
"Our Life" returns to television screens on September 26.
In the United States, two elite university employees were arrested after a state hunt.
Forty-two-year-old Northwestern professor Wyndham Lathem turned himself in to police in California after being sought by police.
The 56-year-old Oxford University employee, Andrew Warren, was arrested by police in San Francisco.
"Men suspected of brutal stabbing of 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau".
He was found dead in Lathem's apartment in Chicago at the end of last month.
A few days later, the suspects made a large donation to a library in cash under the name of the deceased.
Before he turned himself in, a Chicago police official said Latham had sent a video to friends and family about the biggest mistake of his life.
CNN didn't see the video and the police won't release it.
According to police, it was a brutal murder, and his body had been altered due to the wounds.
Warren had recently arrived in Chicago from the United Kingdom, but investigators have not yet determined if and how he was acquainted with the victim.
Before being arrested, both suspects fled the state.
Elise Christie talks about how she got over Sochi’s horrors and cyberbullying to skate again for gold
Compared to this fragile young woman, who recently considered saying goodbye to the ice rink forever, 26-year-old Christie has changed beyond recognition.
The vicious insults came down on him, especially since he had been bullied while attending school in West Lothian as a child.
He is now bursting with confidence and believes that the ordeal could circle back to its starting point, bringing with it at least one piece of gold in PyeongChang.
"Without a doubt, I want to come out as an Olympic champion," he says, without fear of specifying the goal.
“I feel like I’m in the right place, both physically and mentally, to be able to do that.”
Once he dreamed of a career as a figure skater, until aesthetic elements began to reduce this interest.
"I was a very good jumper, but I had trouble with the artistic side of it," he said, laughing.
"I wasn't very good at elegance, at decency.
It was a sensible choice because short-distance skating fits my personality best."
A woman walks around the world on foot: my daily budget is $5!
To be honest, I’ve had this experience myself, true for 40 days, when I decided to live a “hobo” life in the south of France just to be free and live a day at a time.
Stayed overnight in a tent, forest, small town stations, etc.
In the second week I joined a French "homeless" man who was 44 years old..
Oh, don’t think that some fags or the like: We just stayed in the same park in Mentone and became friends, although he was 15 years older than me, was good company.
Turns out he's from a good family, Paris, a former French Navy officer.
No alcohol, no crime, in other words, decent person, intelligent, pleasant communicator, seen life.
In short, I joined him and for the next 3 weeks we wandered together, from town to town and also about 5€ per day for food money.
The money will come, so you’ll live.
He taught how to help in the evenings on the terraces of hotels and restaurants and on farms on the road.
We worked so hard that we could have food for the next 2-3 days and then...
I had a fever and decided I couldn’t take it anymore.
I took a flight to Helsinki.
And by the way, I'm sorry so far.
Those 40 days were probably the best of my life.
A man was burned alive in Indonesia after stealing three sound amplifiers from a mosque, the Hungarian news agency MTI reported.
A 30-year-old thief sneaked out of a mosque in Bekas, near the capital Jakarta, on August 1, but a sanctuary guard spotted him and shouted, "Take the thief!"
He came to the rescue and immediately followed the thief.
He escaped on a motorcycle and even swam across the river.
The chase lasted a few kilometers, then one of the pursuers threw a stone at the chased head, causing serious injury.
An enraged group of persecutors caught the thief and beat him up.
One of the pursuers poured gasoline over the thief and set him on fire.
The innocent died from burns at the scene.
The body was taken to East Jakarta Police Hospital.
Police took possession of both the deceased's motorcycle and the stolen sound amplifiers.
At first, reports appeared in the local press, as if it was not a thief, but an electrical engineer who wanted to repair the sound amplifiers.
However, the police strongly refuted these claims.
The family of the deceased said they would not make a statement about the incident.
According to the German news agency dpa, the reason for this move is that Indonesians have little confidence in either the police or the judicial authorities.
Indonesia is the largest Islamic country in the world.
Of the 255 million people in the world, 87.2% are Muslims.
Australian cuisine: from finger-bending to schoolyard.
Indigenous Aboriginal peoples have inherited finger lime and kangaroo meat from modern Australian cuisine.
British roots have also had a lot of influence on the food table there - for example, Vegemite, a dark brown salty brewer's yeast butter, which is smeared with butter on a pastry or cracker, resembles the British Marmite.
Meat pies, or meat pies in puff pastry, served with boiled potatoes and sauce, also come from the British.
There are also BBQ Snags, or raw sausages, which Australians cook on the grill, while British ones are more likely to cook in the oven.
One of the local sweet stars is Pavlova beseetort, although it is also called by New Zealanders for its invention.
The sweet is also loved with coconut and oatmeal crispy Anzac biscuits and coconut-flavored chocolate-coated cupcake lamingtons.
Honey Joys are called honey-flakes.
Australian cooking celebrity Stephanie Alexander and her life’s work, the kitchen Bible of home cooks, is in at least half a million Australian homes. / Blake Storey, Prime Creative Media
Stephanie is celebrating her 77th birthday this autumn.
Her father was a public servant and her mother Mary loved food very much.
Stephanie studied librarianship at the university and, as is the custom for young Australians if possible, went on to explore Europe after her studies.
While traveling in France, Stephanie's love of food only solidified and developed.
In London, however, she met her first husband, Monty of Jamaican descent, with whom she opened The Jamaican House in Melbourne in 1964.
A decade later, the marriage fell apart and the restaurant closed its doors.
In 1976, he opened Stephanie’s Restaurant, one of Melbourne’s most prestigious restaurants for the next 21 years.
The landmark restaurant is still being talked about as the first fine dining restaurant in Melbourne that really knew how to value fresh produce and offered seasonal food – a fact that seems to be true today, but it wasn’t there at the end of the last century.
Since his retirement from the restaurant business in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing cookbooks, 15 of which have been published by him.
There are even more productive food writers in Estonia, but in his case, no book has just been a recipe collection.
For Australian home cooks, the various Stephanie Alexander cookbooks have been irreplaceable.
For her life’s work, she is the author of the fifth cookbook, The Cook’s Companion, which is now home to at least half a million Australians.
The book was first published in 1996, supplemented with a release in 2004 and the latest version in 2014.
In my bookcase, this 2004 release takes up quite a bit of space, because the imposing book has about a thousand recipes on 1126 pages!
The latest option, however, is even more extensive.
Stephanie Alexander's Lifetime Achievement: "The Cook's Companion" is in at least half a million Australian homes
This is a real cooking Bible, which, in addition to recipes, deals with the purchase and preservation of various raw materials, introduces cooking technologies and gives recommendations for the purchase of kitchen utensils.
Foodstuffs are in alphabetical order, and there are also many cross-references in the work - obviously, the education of librarians did not run down the side of the food writer.
Stephanie herself points out that it was this book that changed her life and gave a new direction to her future work.
The book’s popularity led to the feeling that it had something to give people, leading to the next big kitchen garden project, which in our circumstances is comparable to school gardens.
The fourth person in Estonia got a heart in Finland.
The doctors of the North Estonian Regional Hospital (PERH), cardiosurgeon Günter Taal and cardiologist Pentti Põdra, who participated in the surgery together with Finnish medics, said that the post-operative period was as expected.
"It is very difficult to say how long the patient could have lived without a new heart," Põder said.
According to doctors, the heart pump has now been used for a maximum of eight years.
The man himself is still recovering and is not ready to talk about it.
He was first diagnosed with heart failure two years ago, and the disease was already in its final stage, which was caused by ischemic disease.
"For this patient, transplantation was the only option," Taal added.
According to the cardiosurgeon, the patient no longer has the batteries and cord that come with the heart pump after the transplant.
All he's left with is scars and immune-suppressing drugs.
The patient can do sports and generally lives on like a normal person,” he said.
The first year is the most dangerous.
Põder added that it would take three to six months for a full recovery.
According to both doctors, the patient must strictly monitor the intake of drugs on a regular basis; at the same time, the drugs also have side effects.
In addition, the patient should be monitored to avoid rejection of the donor organ.
The first year is the most dangerous, but according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT), 50 percent of patients have lived for more than a decade.
Taal said that the results were better in Helsinki and the longest lived with a transplanted heart was 25 years ago.
The cardiosurgeon explained that because the patient’s circulation was poor due to the illness, he was given a heart pump a year ago to help him recover from the operation.
When the man's pulmonary artery pressure dropped, he became a suitable candidate for transplant.
According to Tali, the transplant operation is not considered a very complicated operation: timing is very important.
"It took a lot more time to get the pump and then get the heart when you put a new heart in," he said.
In addition, the cardiosurgeon brought out the coming off of the out-of-body circulation as a complicated part of the operation.
In his words, heart transplantation can be considered rare, because it is what Estonians need the least.
There are much more kidney, liver and lung transplants.
There is still a lot of excitement in this rare surgery, but we have been practicing this work for many years.
Getting to know yourself and your nervous system is an art in this profession,” Taal added.
Four more people need the organ.
According to Taal, the patient was given a heart because the body was not suitable for patients living in any other country of Scandiatranspland.
Scandiatransplant is an organ exchange organisation with members from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
There are currently four more people on the heart transplant list in Estonia.
“These are patients,” he said.
It is said that men with the 0-positive blood type have the longest waiting for their heart.
"In Finland, it's been about six months," he said.
There are also conditions for getting a heart.
"Usually a woman's heart is not good for a man, a big man's heart is bad for a small one, and so on," the cardiosurgeon said.
How to finance company vehicles?
In a changed consumer society, the financing possibilities of companies’ vehicles have expanded – in addition to standard leasing, more and more companies are using full service leasing or more duty-free long-term car rental.
Leasing and leasing a vehicle are two distinctly different financial transactions that involve different obligations and expectations, but which often still create confusion.
According to Villi Tõld, Sales and Marketing Manager of the international car rental company AVIS Eesti, it can be seen that companies are moving towards full service leasing more and more and more, and the long-term rental option is also being used more and more.
Tõld pointed out the main questions, which can be answered by choosing a suitable way of using the vehicle.
How long to use the vehicle?
The biggest difference between renting and leasing a car is the time of use.
"Lease should be preferred for long-term use of the vehicle if the company has a plan to use commercial vehicles for a longer period of time", explained Tõld, adding that it is worth deciding whether to own a vehicle, to use full service lease or long-term lease if the vehicle is to be used as a service, i.e. to use the car on a daily basis, but leaving the maintenance obligations to the service provider and, so to say, giving up ownership.
“The car has a much shorter period of use than the leasing period, but many larger car rental companies also offer long-term car rental, where the car rental is without complicated contracts and free return,” Tõld introduced various car rental options.
Who owns the vehicle?
At the end of the lease, the tenant becomes the owner of the car.
"With full service leasing, it is possible to continue with a leasing payment on the same or better terms, replacing an equivalent new vehicle that meets the needs of the company," he said, emphasising that as the consumer society is increasingly moving towards service-oriented consumption, owning a vehicle is an additional obligation for the company.
In the case of full service leasing, it is also possible to buy a car on the basis of desire and agreed conditions.
However, this option is not available and is only paid for the period of use.
Car leasing is generally done at car dealerships and car rental from rental offices of car rental companies.
Car dealerships are primarily engaged in the sale of vehicles, but they also offer leasing and in some cases car rental.
However, rental companies have cars for the sole purpose of renting them out.
Tõld said that the reasons for using the rental service are different – many companies rent official vehicles, it is also convenient to use the service during business trips or holidays, or if your own car is under repair.
“In the case of official vehicles, there is an increasing shift to full service leasing, which provides the customer with transparency of costs, time savings in the vehicle purchase, use and return process, and greater convenience,” explained the sales and marketing manager.
Every year, more and more companies use full service leasing for their car fleet, thereby optimising their spending and focusing on their core business.
What is service-based insurance coverage?
If motor third party liability insurance is mandatory in the case of a leased car, then the rental car is mostly covered by basic insurance and it is also necessary to decide whether to take additional emergency insurance, theft insurance or full insurance. "But if you compare regular leasing with full service leasing, then the customer will receive more at the same monthly payment, because in addition to the vehicle and insurance, the monthly payment will also cover regular car maintenance, 24-hour assistance, tire changes and other agreed services," explained Tõl.
“If any new vehicle can be taken into standard lease, then in case of full service lease, the service provider will help to choose a vehicle that meets the wishes and needs of the company, which also takes into account the functions of use,” he compared, stressing that full service lease will definitely help to optimize the expenses related to the company’s car parks.
“However, the choice of rental vehicles depends on the car park of the service provider – different rental companies offer a small and economical vehicle for use in city traffic as well as a luxury sedan for business meetings,” Tõld described.
During a tight rental period, it can happen that the desired car has already been rented out, but booking the desired vehicle in advance will help against this.
When choosing between leasing or renting, you should first make clear your goals - how long you want to use the vehicle for, and what are the long-term plans regarding the car.
It is also worth carefully examining the various terms and conditions of the services.
At yesterday’s press conference, Olga Ivanova, a member of the Riigikogu who joined Savisaar’s election coalition, said that the election coalition called Savisaar offers the Centre Party healthy competition in the autumn elections in Tallinn.
But how likely is Edgar Savisaar’s cooperation with Urmas Sõõrumaa’s election coalition “Tagus Tallinn”?
U.S. Navy Veteran Ordered to Remove American Flag Cover From Mailbox
The erudition between a veteran of the United States and the Florida Homeowners' Union is at the center of a heated dispute over an American-flagged mailbox.
Retired United States Navy officer John Ackert says he received a letter last week from the Tallahassee Southwood Housing Association asking him to remove a wrapper depicting the state flag from a mailbox or face punishment.
He told WCTV that he was not going to surrender without a fight and has filed an appeal.
"I treat this frankly as bullying," Ackert said.
And I think people should fight any form of bullying, especially one like that.
Ackert said that the homeowners' union claimed his mailbox was not consistent with Southwood's aesthetic values.
U.S. Navy veteran John Ackert said he was ordered to remove an American flag cover covering his mailbox.
"As we approach the end of the holiday season, we ask that you remove the American flag cover from your mailbox," the letter read.
The decorations may be outside 30 days in advance and must be removed within 15 days at the latest.
He said the case has been out for four years.
It was placed there 30 days after moving into the house.
Messages to the Southwood Housing Association received no immediate response Thursday morning.
Some of Ackert's neighbors told WCTV that the letter was a bit harsh, and were not particularly surprised by the actions of the Homeowners' Association.
"They do these things all the time," said Mike Stephenson.
I think it's ridiculous.
Why not be patriotic in your own country?
Mike Patel said, "This is a veteran who served our country.
It's just a mailbox with a flag.
I don't think that's right.
He owns the house, at least.
The letter from the Homeowners' Association states that Ackert has 15 days to remove the wrapper, otherwise he will face a fine.
He has not responded to his appeal.
Vietnam 'repents' of Germany kidnapping allegations
Vietnam said on Thursday it regretted comments by Germany’s foreign ministry that accused Vietnam’s intelligence service of kidnapping a former Vietnamese oil company wanted for embezzlement.
German authorities believe Trinh Xuan Thanh was caught up in Berlin, which left the Vietnamese intelligence attaches with 48 hours to leave the country on Wednesday.
Thanh faces embezzlement charges involving the death penalty if convicted.
He sought asylum in Germany, but his statement had not yet been processed when Vietnamese authorities demanded his extradition.
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman Le Thi Thu Hang told reporters these comments were "extremely regrettable" and Thanh turned himself in to police in Vietnam on July 31.
"Vietnam always attaches great importance and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany," he said without going into detail.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after being charged with mismanagement by a subsidiary of the state oil and gas giant PetroVietnam, resulting in approximately US$150 million in damages.
Vietnamese police issued an arrest warrant in September.
In March, police launched an investigation to investigate the embezzlement in connection with his alleged involvement in a property development project.
Thanh was chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed to several senior positions in the government, including vice chairman of Hau Giang Province in the southern Mekong Delta.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was released from the Communists' predominance of the legislative body before its first session the following month.
He was also expelled from the Communist Party.
Vietnam's ambassador to Germany was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and was informed that Germany would demand Thanh's return so that asylum and extradition proceedings could be carried out correctly.
The bus driver rescued eight puppies from the driveway, unaware that the dogs actually had an owner.
"Where do I put these eight puppies, I would have been kicked out of the apartment by my wife and the dogs," joked bus driver Oleg, who rescued the dogs that were walking around unattended by the driveway, handing them over to a shelter worker.
Soon, however, the owner of the dogs appeared at the shelter, for whom it was unclear why the puppies were taken away from his home.
Harjumaa bus driver Oleg said that he has been working as a bus driver since the beginning of the 1990s, but this has never happened before in his career."
Near Harju-Risti I noticed that something small was running around by the road.
I thought it was a raccoon, but it turned out to be four puppies,” the bus driver recalled.
Oleg was heartbroken and stopped a bus full of passengers to pick up the puppies.
"Unfortunately, the cars would have run over them and crushed the dogs," Oleg said.
He added that the passengers were reasonable and that they were also very happy with the soft dog children.
The puppies were a bit scared at first, but then they became fun.
Puppies on board, the bus driver went on a new lap because the timetable needed to be followed.
On the way back, he saw four other dogs.
They were German Shepherd puppies.
They were so fluffy, and it was immediately obvious that they had been taken care of.
The dogs were beautiful, amazing.
The first thought, of course, was that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason", the bus driver said, for this reason he decided to carry the puppies to the bus.
"I picked up these four puppies and called the police," Oleg recalled.
Law enforcement contacted the Tallinn Animal Shelter, whose employee came to pick up the puppies at the Baltic Station.
But wasn't the bus driver tempted to take the hairballs?
That was the idea.
The dog was so beautiful and calm.
“He was like an adult dog,” Oleg said.
But where do I put these eight puppies?
I would have been kicked out of the apartment by a woman with dogs.
We also have a small child.
“It’s too early for a dog,” he added.
The head of the Tallinn Animal Shelter, Eve Tobias, confirmed that 8 German Shepherd puppies, who are two and a half months old, were brought to the shelter.
On the same day, the owner came to pick up the puppy.
“We didn’t even check them in and give them back,” he said.
"The owner of the dogs was not very upset, but he did say that they had the only house in sight and the bus driver could have asked if the puppies belonged to them," Tobias said.
The manager of the shelter added, however, that it is also good that the bus driver picked up the brats who had been raging by the road, and therefore did not have an accident with them.
It was really nice of the bus driver to respond.
Jordan court upholds life sentence for killing three U.S. soldiers
A Jordanian military appeals court sentenced a Jordanian soldier last year to life imprisonment for the shooting of three U.S. military trainers.
A military tribunal last month sentenced Senior Sergeant Marik al-Tuwayha to life imprisonment for killing Americans at the entrance to South Jordan Air Base, along with hard work.
Al-Tuwayha opened fire on the American caravan, claiming that he feared an attack on the base.
However, a security camera video released after the decision revealed that he continued shooting even when two Americans were shadowing and waving their hands to stop the shooting.
News site Hala Akhbar, linked to the Jordanian military, said Thursday that a five-judge military appeals court upheld al-Tuwayha's sentence.
James Harrison spends $300,000 a year trying to keep his body in shape.
Each player in the NFL depends on their body to make a living.
Therefore, many other athletes also invest a lot of money in maintaining and restoring the body in order to stay in top shape.
Jeremy Fowler from ESPN.com took a closer look at how far some veterans are willing to go to extend their careers.
No case is as extreme as that of 39-year-old James Harrison, the Pittsburgh Steelers' back linebacker preparing for season 14.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends an average of $300,000 a year on acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractors, and cupping.
Most of the cost is associated with traveling around the country to meet professionals.
"I don't have to keep track of things like that," Harrison said.
“When you compare the amounts you earn with my spending, the payouts are worth it, given how I feel.”
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and teammate for the Steelers, estimated the annual cost of taking care of his body at $200,000.
Mitchell, 30, has tested body tempering, which Fowler described as "the use of 55 pounds of metal as a massage roller".
"Instead of rolling on it, it's rolling on you," Mitchell said.
"If you have a tight spot on your feet and they start to move that thing around, it's painful at times.
But when you get up, the tension is gone.
It just kicks the tension out."
They’re willing to make an extra effort, but former NFL players Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris spend an average of $50,000 a year on recovery.
Cofield, who played 10 seasons with the New York Giants and Washington Redskins, has expressed regret that he did not spend more.
"If I could go back, I would invest even more," Cofield told Fowler.
“I’d probably pay twice as much.
I was in very good health for the first eight years of my career.
Maybe it would have helped more.”
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old backfield player, expressed willingness to step in the footsteps of his veteran Steelers teammates.
"If you pay $100,000 and you make an additional three million while playing, that decision is pretty easy," Shazier said.
When it comes to career longevity, investing in players’ recovery is much smarter than spending money on cars and villas.
The average NFL player is lucky if he can play for more than 30 years, the more Harrison’s success should convince his colleagues to shift their spending.
But maybe they can just find some local specialists.
Gunnar Viese, the boss of Weekend Festival Baltic, tells Õhtuleht that the festival originally came from Finland years ago and its owners went to see the beach next to Riga for expansion, but on their way back they stopped in Pärnu and so the festival was sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says they have set a target of 25,000 visitors per day, but the chicks will only be read when the festival is over.
Preparation for this year’s party began in September.
"We had information from the city that construction would begin on the previous site, and there will be a hotel," Gunnar says.
There are no buckets there at the moment, but it is assumed that if the bucket did not go to the ground this year, it will go to the next.
So maybe we should have moved out of there sometime,” he explains why the festival area has moved this year.
Festivals are held throughout the year.
A total of 1,000 and a half people work at the Weekend - police officers, organizing team, volunteers, traders, security team and so on.
According to Vies, the most difficult thing for Weekend was getting the duo The Chainsmokers to perform.
They are now the undisputed leader of the pop music scene.
Why it was hard to get The Chainsmokers to go to Weekend and how Gunnar comments about the two artists canceling their performances, see already in the video.
Ratas in response to Ansip: We have done a lot for Estonia’s success.
Vice-President of the European Commission Andrus Ansip said in an interview to the Chronicle that he is saddened to see Estonia’s everyday politics, as the government of Jüri Ratas has turned the simple and predictable tax system on its head.
You took the opportunity to ask me what I have done for Estonia’s success and what I can be proud of.
I am glad that we have made many important decisions in the government as a good team, many of which have been expected in Estonia for more than a decade," Ratas wrote on social media.
According to Ratas, these decisions include the income tax reform to raise people’s incomes, the pension reform to ensure a dignified retirement for the elderly, the local government reform to balance the development of Estonia, the increase in agricultural support to revive rural life, and, of course, the health care reform to provide accessible and high-quality medical care.
"I wish you a good rest!" wrote Ratas in his address to Ansip.

Last night at 3:00 a.m., the cops got a little bit of a challenge.
An Audi owner said a stranger had climbed into his car and fallen asleep at a gas station near Port Artur.
A patrol responding to the event found a man who was startled when the police arrived.
The man was tired for a moment and found a place in the back seat of a stranger’s car.
"The man returned home after a wake-up call from the police," the western prefecture wrote on Facebook.
All's well that ends well!
There is no need to look far for a good outdoor cinema – on August 7-12 in the centre of Tartu, right on the Town Hall Square, the tARTuFF film festival will take place.
What makes it special is its focus on love movies.
The program also includes films that depict the darker side of love, sees new films as well as good old classics.
Numerous special events in many places make the campus a movie city for a week.
All films are free for visitors, seats up to 1,500, and this year there is an artificial turf-covered area right in front of the screen, creating a temporary park mood in the central square of the city.
In the largest outdoor cinema in Europe, Switzerland, the film can be enjoyed by 8,000 visitors at a time.
The heart of the Locarno Film Festival will be Piazza Grande, the Grand Square, from 2 to 12 August.
The festival will feature many premieres by renowned directors and actors.
When the night falls, a 15-20 euro ticket must be redeemed to enjoy one movie.
Pula Film Festival in the Roman amphitheatre, Croatia
Gladiators, blood, screaming crowds, muddy arena - such a picture was opened 2000 years ago in the Pula Amphitheatre in Croatia, where now an international audience is enjoying the films in the summer night of July.
The first outdoor screen was set in a Roman building in 1953, making the Pula Film Festival one of the oldest outdoor cinemas in Europe.
Under the stars are Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, John Malkovich and Ben Kingsley.
The price is symbolic: an evening in the throes of the Mediterranean with high-quality films means spending around three euros.
Sala Montjuïc open-air cinema, Spain
Next to the film, Sala Montjuïc offers a wonderful view of the open-air cinema.
It is located on the Montjuïc, or Jewish hill above Barcelona.
In the evening darkness of southern Europe, the moat of the fort on the hill overlooks all of Barcelona’s lights, a sight in itself.
The organizers of the moat set up a big screen by July, showing well-known films from La La Land to Manhattan in 1979.
Up to 2,500 people can go to the cinema at the same time and 6.50 euros must be paid for the entrance.
The ticket price includes an open-air concert just before the movie, which is allowed to enjoy next to your picnic basket.
Those who do not want to sit on the lawn or have forgotten their picnic blanket can rent a deck chair for three euros.
Cinema under the stars, Italy
The true breath of nostalgic Italy can be experienced in the central square of Bologna, where the restored pearls of the local film archive are displayed on summer evenings.
The 10th largest church in the world, the Basilica of San Petronio can accommodate 3,000-5,000 people.
Mainly the northern Italian buildings of the 15th century with the warmth of a summer evening and good company create a romantic atmosphere in which every crisp northerner melts.
From June 19th to August 15th, there is a new movie in front of the audience every night, all for free.
Bologna Film Archive Festival "Under the Stars".
Vienna Town Hall Square Film Festival, Austria
Vienna is a mecca of the music world, even showing films: the Austrian Film Festival (Wiener Rathausplatz Film Festival) exclusively includes concert recordings and musical films.
5,000 free seats are filled every evening from 30 June to 3 September.
In addition to classical music stars – Placido Domingo and the Vienna Philharmonic – the festival offers jazz music recordings in the morning.
What makes the film special is the love of good food in Vienna – in addition to world-class music, you can enjoy the dishes of the best restaurants.
A food and drink area is open every day from 11 am to midnight, offering traditional Austrian flavors, as well as delicacies from Asian, Greek, Italian, Mexican and Indian cuisines.
The dumbest questions to ask a bartender.
The Huffington Post reports that bartenders would rather not hear about it.
What kind of drink do you make best?
Yes, some drinks have more ingredients than others, but they require the same skill and skill.
Bar attendants often interpret this question as "What's the easiest/fastest thing for you to make right now?", which signals them that the customer is having trouble making it for the bartender, regardless of what he's drinking.
Which drink do you like the most?
This question is interpreted in the same way, which cocktail would be the easiest to get from the bartender right now.
It is not for the bar attendant to say this, but the customer makes decisions based on the thickness of his wallet.
Instead, wait for the bartenders to ask if there are any special offers at the moment.
What's good about it?
Perhaps there is a sincere desire behind this question to find out if the bar stands out with some offers from others, but it could also be asked otherwise.
The bartender also has no idea what the customer would prefer.
Can I have a drink that's not very sweet?
Here, similarly to the previous rule, the bartender is not aware of your tastes and preferences, and what is sweet for one may not be sweet for others.
But he is willing to listen to what flavors the desired cocktail could contain.
Does this drink give me a headache?
A bartender isn't a medic or a fortune teller to let a client do it, hand on heart.
The cold summer has caused Estonians to travel abroad to such an extent that the package tours are not only expensive, but sold out regardless of the price.
Even cheap flights and last-minute tickets are not worth hoping for; it is wiser to think about next year’s travel plans instead.
He's holding a model hostage with a plan to sell her on the dark web.
A Polish citizen has taken a British model hostage in Italy.
The man was planning to auction off a 20-year-old woman on the dark web, the Guardian reported.
Police said she was lured to Milan on July 11 with a promise that she would get a job in a photo shoot.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
The jailers allegedly tried to sell her for £230,000 on the dark web and filed a ransom with her modeling agency.
However, his captor took him to the British consulate on 17 July.
Police have confirmed the suspect is Lukasz Herba, a Polish national living in the UK.
According to the Corriere della Sera newspaper, the man discovered that the kidnapped woman had a small child and was unwilling to sell him as a sex slave.
Such experiments attract people.
It would be great if we could continue to think and draw conclusions.
The suggestion to spend a little more time researching the background of those who want to be friends is obvious.
More generally, everyone should have a strategy that they share on social media.
At the state level, however, one has to ask whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the dangers posed by social media.
The life expectancy of the fakes created under controlled conditions ended with a summer school, but the life of the original bad guys certainly did not.
Sometimes you have to walk in the woods for whatever reason.
However, if you feel cold, it’s time to have a hot tea.
There are plenty of resources in the forest.
Protect Home! makes a small review.
We are talking about tea because coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which is to some extent invigorating, but it is not good for our health.
When using plants found in the wild, you should always be prepared for testing, because both recipes and flavors are different.
Some plants do not need to be boiled for long, just pouring hot water is enough, while others need to be left to brew for hours.
Of course, care must also be taken to ensure that the water and plants are sufficiently clean.
It also depends a lot on the time and place of year.
Now let’s take a closer look at how to make a simple tea drink and what effect it can have on us.
Männiokkade
You can drink water all year round.
If it is good to drink 2 liters of water a day, then this tea is well suited to satisfy the need for vitamin C and also to give a little extra energy.
As with all plants, it is possible to pick up useful elements from pine needles using alternative methods, for example, by crushing - the thorns do not need to be boiled for long, it is enough to overfeed with hot water and leave it to brew for a few hours.
For half a liter of water, it takes 0.4 liters of thorns, which need to be boiled for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink with nearly 25 mg of vitamin C, a lot of potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 cubes of sugar, i.e. about 20 kcal of sugar.
Lemon and honey can always be added to the pine needles to improve the taste.
And if the drink became ugly strong, it can be diluted with water like syrup.
Making spruce needles is the same, but the drink itself tastes a little different
Raspberry drink is excellent and helps against many ailments, from rheumatism to pimples.
Raspberry helps to overcome fatigue, has an analgesic effect and helps with colds both as a cough reliever and as a fever reliever.
Therefore, you should not drink more than half a liter a day.
Raspberry drink also makes you sweat, which is why in winter you should find a calmer moment to enjoy it.
To prepare the drink in winter, take fresh raspberry stalks, in summer use leaves, shoots or berries.
For half a litre of drink, you will need a small bunch of branches of proper length, which will have to be boiled until the water turns a reddish tint.
Raspberry straws can also be used to make an image.
To do this, crush the stems and keep them in warm water for a couple of hours.
A longer and more thorough treatment also makes the drink stronger.
The finished raspberry drink can also be added to the pine needles for taste.
Black-bellied tea
A black locust is a tree fungus that in nature looks like a piece of wood that has been blackened.
It is mostly found on birch, but also elsewhere.
The use of the mushroom is very wide - as a hot drink, to light a fire, instead of incense, etc.
You can also wash yourself very well with ash.
Black pepper tea is a kind of super drink that can be used for the treatment or relief of many diseases, even cancer, to increase tone, reduce stress, prolong life.
The fungus contains a number of unique compounds and a lot of B vitamins, as well as antioxidants and a bit of minerals and protein.
Tea made from mushrooms can be drunk every day, there is no risk of overconsumption.
To make a drink, about 3 x 3 cm of a piece of mushroom is enough, which must be boiled in 2-3 liters of water for 5-15 minutes.
Today, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited Vormsi, the fourth largest island in Estonia, as part of a tour of small islands, where he met with local rural municipality leaders and residents to discuss current issues in island life.
The tour of Vormsi island started in the port of Sviby, where Prime Minister Ratas was greeted by Tanel Viks, the mayor of Vormsi municipality, and Ivo Sarapuu, the chairman of the municipal council.
The first to visit was the historic St. Olav’s Church and the adjoining cemetery, which is unique in Estonia for its limestone and sandstone ring crosses.
This was followed by a visit to Vormsi Kindergarten-Basic School, where Director Age Hälvin talked to the Prime Minister about the school’s life and the organisation of studies, according to which some of the school’s students are in distance learning.
Before noon, the Prime Minister visited the new and modern joint operational service building, which was opened in 2015, and also held a meeting with the islanders.
Important issues for residents were discussed, such as the development of shipping and air routes between the small islands and the mainland.
The state has undertaken to ensure regular transport connections on permanently inhabited small islands, but the increasing traffic, for example, also makes the important journeys of local residents more difficult.
These are places where the state can take local wishes and needs into account at an early stage and in the planning process,” the Prime Minister said.
In addition, issues of small craft port construction, hobby education, island safety and rescue capability were discussed.
Today’s visit to Vormsi was the last part of the Prime Minister’s tour of the small islands, to get to know the living environment of the islands and discuss issues with local residents and local government leaders.
In July, Head of Government Ratas visited Saaremaa, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi islands and Manilaidu; during August, he has visited Naissaar, Prangli and Aegna.
For the first time, the Centre Party will go to the elections without the founder and ideological cornerstone of the party.
So far, we’ve been talking about savior or vice versa.
Now we have to find the middle ground.
At the same time, they also have to choose between the colourful, sometimes criminal and embarrassing past of the party, the expectations of Savisaar’s supporters within the party, and the expectations of the voters.
The departure of Savisaar puts the Centre Party in its most difficult situation on an ideological scale.
Based on current political practice and ideology, the old rhino is sure to overplay them.
Many of the cards that used to be trump cards may not work this time around.
The populist map for the Centre Party does not work because Savisaar can always promise more than the Prime Minister's Party.
Playing on the Russian map is difficult both because of the Centre Party’s position in the government and because here, too, we see the so-called Savinova election coalition pushing the gas to the bottom.
The victim's card is already in Savisaar's pocket due to the ongoing trial.
For the Centre Party, the map of the Popular Front and the poor offended has also been lost.
The former is of little value without its founder, and the latter is hindered by coalition partners in government.
However, one card may be even more important.
All the latest elections have confirmed that the parties that are able to formulate the main conflict of the elections and then carry it out are successful.
The main conflict has always revolved around Savisaar.
If a party should have the idea to breathe life into a well-functioning confrontation, there is another trump card missing from the Centre Party deck.
What's in the middle?
They have a strong party apparatus and considerable resources left.
There will also be enough tape cuts before the election.
Most of the shameless self-promotion made with taxpayers’ money four years ago has now hopefully been repaid to the citizens of Tallinn.
Tallinn’s urban media still exist, but the cultivation of partisan guerrilla journalism has remained even less there.
In addition, the party has voting magnets.
Their role this time will be to get the chestnuts out of the fire, because the image of the ruling party is not enough to motivate the voters.
From an ideological point of view, Jüri Ratas has to find his own way, because the journey with clay islanding ended this week.
Three U.S. Marines were reported missing in Australia.
The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have completed a search operation, Marine Corps Base Camp Butler said in a statement in Japan, basically confirming that the military is no longer hoping to find the missing persons alive.
The accident occurred with the Osprey MV-22, a Navy aircraft that took off from the USS Bonhomme Richard.
Of the 26 people on board, 23 were found and rescued.
The plane crashed into the sea last month during a joint US-Australia exercise in Shoalwater Bay, Queensland.
Australia's Defence Minister Marise Payne said Saturday's incident took place off the coast of Shoalwater Bay.
Woman finds wedding ring in washing machine - who should it belong to?
“I started to take the laundry out of the machine when the light between the rubber seal of the washing machine caught my eye,” she tells how she found a wedding ring from a stranger in her washing machine.
In fact, Karin did not pay attention to the gloss at the washing machine door at first.
I restarted the machine.
"With two small children, this dirty laundry immediately arises," the woman mutters.
When the second wash was over and I started to take the laundry out, I still got the light between the rubber seal of the washing machine and found this ring.
The gold wedding ring is engraved with the name of the man who married 14 years ago - Tomi.
Since someone in the family with that name, a man or a woman, who could be married to a Tom, I don't know, the ring is a complete mystery.
Karin asked the older child if she had found the ring and put it in her pocket, but the child confirmed that she had not brought the ring home.
Karin and her life partner have lived in Tallinn in the apartment on Madala Street for a year.
They used to rent it out, and from that time, the washing machine also came.
But if the ring had anything to do with the tenants, how did it get into the machine?
“Now I’m at a loss and can’t figure out which way the ring landed in the washing machine,” she laughs.
As the pace of life next to the two young children is rather fast, the first thing to do was to forget about the closet at home.
"Recently, there have been posts looking for the owner of a wedding ring, and now it seemed that it was high time to look for the owner of the ring," Karin refers to a case on social media where the wedding ring found on Puhangu Street in Tallinn found its owner last week.
“Since people are looking for different things on Facebook, I thought I’d try my luck first,” says Karin, whose post has already been shared by nearly 4,000 people.
"The post has received all kinds of feedback and not everything is good", she sighs, pointing out that the first comments suggested that she take her husband to the drawing.
I felt like I needed this shit now.
That my husband has become the biggest cheater I've ever heard of.
To be honest, I was worried at first, but later on, when comments came out that I might have been messing with the ring owner, it made me laugh.
The commenters also suggested that the ring might have reached the woman in a second-round pocket.
“Well, the last time we bought a pair of second-round pants to go to work was six months ago, which flew into the washing machine without any further investigation, but is it?” she says.
Be that as it may, my partner and I agreed that now, for principle's sake, we have to find the ring's owner.
Whatever the cause of the ring's disappearance.
A divorce, a family dispute or whatever.
I think it's the right thing to do, because if I ever lose my wedding ring, I know I'd be grateful to someone who'd try to find me and return valuable property.
Karin has also turned to the registry office to get help finding the owner.
However, I was told that I would never get married on a date like this.
A ring has found its owner.
Recently, the owner received a wedding ring found in Pelguranna, Tallinn, on 21 July, the engraving of which suggested that it belonged to an elderly woman.
"I was walking with the dogs this morning and I noticed a golden ring behind the building of Puhangu 53, inside the paved track", Gerli says that the engraving promised to assume that it belonged to an elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (pictured) on her Facebook page and in the group "Marked in Tallinn", shared information with Põhja-Tallinn district and Põhja prefecture.
Two weeks later, police contacted Gerl and reported that the ring wearer had been identified.
"I got the owner's daughter in touch and on Monday night the find went into the daughter's possession." The ring was gone because the old lady had injured her hand and put the ring on the other finger, from where it had slipped off.
"He lost it the morning I walked my dog," says Gerli.
Although the media’s attention is mainly focused on Pärnu and the Weekend taking place there, it is not the only music festival this weekend.
There are also loyal fans at the Intsikurmu festival in Põlva County.
For example, one of them wrote on Twitter: "I sold my Weekend ticket so I could go to Intsikurmu".
And why not?
In addition to domestic artists, there will also be performers from America, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England and elsewhere.
The festival, held in a magical forest, also surprises the artists performing there due to its charming location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, did not manage to find out on Twitter this morning how beautiful Estonia is.
But the visitors have also not had a good time sharing.
To see the magic of Intsikurmu festival yourself, check out the gallery!
The Estonian U18 team recognised the superiority of Great Britain in the semi-final and cannot pass the A-division
The match started extremely fast, and in the first quarter, which the British won by five points (18:23), many baskets were thrown.
In the second quarter, the gap increased further, and the break was followed by a nine-point improvement (31:40).
Estonia managed to win the third quarter, but with only one point.
The final score of the last 10 minutes was 46:54.
In the fourth quarter, Estonia’s game completely fell apart and in the end, the loss was 61:75.
The defeat shattered the Estonians’ hopes of reaching Division A, as only the two best teams will be able to enter.
In tomorrow’s third-place match, Estonia will face Croatia – the loser of the match between Israel and Croatia.

Australian Leagues at a Crossroads
Professional sport is at a crossroads in Australia: some sports have travelled so far on the corporate road that they are too business-centred to be classified as a sport;
others return to the amateur world, which is too sport-centred to be considered a business.
This confusion is evidenced by the painful delays by Cricket Australia (CA) in reaching a salary agreement with players, the indecision of the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) in firing the team, the insurrection of the Australian Football Federation (FFA) stakeholders, the difficulties of the rugby league in assembling a functioning independent commission, and the relentless efforts of the Australian Football League (AFL) to be the flag bearer of social justice among the people.
John Wylie, an investment banker and chairman of the Australian Sports Commission, has sought to steer Olympic sports actively along the same path as professional leagues, placing businessmen with no elite experience in the sport in leading positions.
Mining giant Rio Tinto, who has a reputation for using tactics to tame trade unions, was seen as a colleague in CA's trouble with the Australian Cricket Players' Association (ACA) in reaching an agreement.
CA chairman David Peever is a former executive director of Rio Tinto Australia and has hired a Rio Tinto manager and advisor to assist CA in wage negotiations.
However, it would be a mistake to think that elite businessmen, whose approach is ruthless in dealing with cricket players, do not love this sport.
Peever, for example, was a regular visitor to Storm's home games until he moved to another state.
Despite this, tough negotiations between the CA and the ACA and extremely high salaries have given the impression that Australia's favorite summer pastime is now more about business than sports.
Conversely, ARU's illiterate leader, former NAB executive Cameron Clyne's failure to pluck out the Australian Super Rugby team has pushed the league back to its roots.
People in rugby union now prefer to stroll to the suburban stadium to watch the game between amateur teams while sipping beer and eating hot dogs.
The rugby union boasts that they have the most corporately qualified and versatile board in Australia, but the league's failures to meet the requirements of international partners show that it is still too much of a sport to be a business.
Both rugby league and football have problems with management as stakeholders demand more power.
Both league premiers, John Grant of ARLC and Steven Lowy of FFA, have shown that their business skills have not been enough to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, a former Kangaroo, ran a successful IT company but was completely out of the game for 20 years.
This became a value when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent chairman.
The league's stakeholders, who did not trust each other, decided that no one who has participated in rugby league in any way in the last three years, except as a passive fan, could take part in the work of the committee.
The pendulum, however, moved too far for the commercial side, and league fans have since sought a savior - someone with a distinguished past in the sport.
Lowy, the executive director of Westfield Foreign Investments, inherited the role of FFA chairman from his father, Frank, one of Australia's richest people.
A-league clubs want to be better represented in the governing Congress.
Their owners lose money but believe they are as respectable as Manchester United.
Ironically, FIFA is sending ambassadors to end the sport’s civil war.
The AFL has its own ties to Rio Tinto through the recently retired chairman Mike Fitzpatrick and former AFL commissioner Chris Lynch, the mining giant's chief financial officer.
The League prides itself on taking national leadership in promoting gender equality, indigenous and refugee activities, and gay rights.
Some cynics might suggest that this is done by spying on government subsidies.
The AFL chairman Richard Goyder, stepping into Fitzpatrick's seat, said, "The AFL is more than just a business, given how it assists all of these communities."
Goyder is the soon-to-be-departing executive chairman of the Wesfarmers and the first chairman of the AFL not to have played the game at an elite level.
Former Wesfarmers chairman Bob Every is active on the Cricket Australia board.
The main feature of appointing board members for professional sports is often the importance of independence over competence.
In the rush to recruit business people, they have forgotten something that could be called attachment and passion for sports.
Moreover, many corporate heavyweights are not accustomed to critical surveillance activity by the media that is intense and sometimes also descending to the personal level.
Something that works in the corporate world may not transfer to the sports field.
Flynn provided a corrected disclosure report showing additional payments
Michael Flynn, who briefly served as President Trump's national security adviser, filed a corrected federal financial disclosure report Thursday that includes new details of Flynn's contracts regarding Trump's transition to the presidency, an Iranian-American businessman-related company, and the parent company of a data science company that worked for the Trump campaign.
In a letter that sent corrections with information, Flynn noted that his original disclosure reports had been filed in hasty conditions without the usual consultation and review provided by White House attorneys and the government's ethics office.
According to the letter, Flynn did not receive the attention he was given because he was no longer a White House employee at the time.
Flynn resigned just 24 days after taking office amid rumors that he had given Vice President Pence misleading information about his post-election ties with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
Flynn also received criticism for making cross-border payments while working in the private sector after resigning as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014.
In information previously released to investigators in the House of Representatives, Flynn declared receiving about $68,000 in fees and payouts from Russian-affiliated entities in 2015.
In addition to Russia-related income, the information provided on Thursday revealed that Flynn has received at least $5,000 for consulting services on a project to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East.
Flynn's work on the project was made public earlier, but it was not known that he was paid for it.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to work with SCL Group - the British parent company of Cambridge Analytica at the time - a data science company hired as part of the Donald Trump campaign.
One of Cambridge's main funders is hedge fund magnate Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is an influential financial supporter of the Conservatives.
The Washington Post reported in February that Flynn was hired as an advisor to SCL Group.
According to those familiar with his role, Flynn's goal was to help SCL's American subsidiary win new government contracts with the United States.
SCL also hired one of Flynn’s former colleagues from the Office of the Chief of National Intelligence to lead the procurement efforts.
Flynn did not receive any benefits from the SCL, nor did he carry out any actual work, according to a person familiar with his activities.
The new information revealed that Flynn received about $28,000 in connection with Trump's move to the presidency.
The largest source of public revenue is $140,000 for Flynn's work as an advisor and consultant to NJK Holding Corp in Minneapolis, led by Nasser Kazeminy, an Iranian-born businessman currently living in the United States.
The Associated Press reported Thursday night a statement by NJK that Flynn "gave advice to NJK Holdings regarding the company's interest in investing in securities".
NJK funds the technology company GreenZone Systems, with Flynn as its vice-chairman.
GreenZone i is headed by Bijan Kian, Flynn's business partner at Flynn Intel, a company currently under investigation for its role in lobbying on behalf of a company operating in the Netherlands that is affiliated with the Turkish government.
Earlier on Thursday, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), a lead Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked Kian to provide information on Flynn's foreign business contacts and trips.
During Flynn's earlier security check, Kian told military investigators that his partner had several foreign business contacts.
However, according to Cummings, Flynn did not say anything about such contacts to the same investigators.
According to a person familiar with the situation, Flynn nevertheless passed the security check at the time.
In Augustibluus the headliner was revived on stage, the singer was taken to Tallinn by ambulance
Ivan reached the end of the set to play when he was hit by a health glitch.
An ambulance was called to massage her heart for several decades”, says organiser Indrek Ditmann to Elu24.
"There was a delay in the plan, but the festival goes on", he says and adds: "The audience has been informed, of course they also saw everything that happened on stage".
At the moment Ivan is on his way to Tallinn in an ambulance and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course we hope for the best", Ditmann concludes.
An eyewitness told Western Life that a health glitch hit Denisenko during a performance.
First the man stopped singing, then the instrumentation began to pass, and the man fell on his back to the stage.
Jan Uuspõld came to the stage and asked if there was a doctor in the audience.
A little later, he asked to pray for Denisenko.
Ivan Denisenko / Augustibluus
Ivan Denisenko, or Ivan Blues, is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural figure.
Ivan’s music career started in parallel with his art studies at the Ukrainian National Academy of Art and Architecture.
His incredibly deep bassist was immediately enthralled at the university and invited to sing at the Golden Gate, a nationally renowned folk choir.
In the choir, he befriended people who introduced him to the blues and who later became his bandmates.
The band's first concert, called Ivan Blues & Friends, took place on December 31, 2007, at a Kiev bar called Rag-Time.
Since then, the band has performed regularly in clubs, concert halls and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes book in Tagalog language
"A Helping Hand" is the first book by Michaels, a former BBC editor and mother of two. Previously, she has written for Singapore Tatler magazine.
The book took three years to complete and is dedicated to his Filipino aides Maricon Espiritu and Ginalyn Naragi, who help with cooking and the care of a son, four-year-old Joseph, and a daughter, eight-year-old Florence.
The helpers, whom he describes as "family members", helped test the recipes while writing the book. this is the first such book in Singapore to be published in both English and Tagalog.
A Helping Hand is available in bookshops throughout Singapore at a price of 39.90 SGD, as well as at emigrant centers abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He thought he'd gotten a stomach virus from a colleague.
But why were his symptoms so different?
At the point of trauma, he was given a large dose of acetaminophen to lower his fever.
For the rest of the day, he was questioned, poked, spied on and examined.
None of the tests showed anything, but they didn't want to send him home.
He understood the reason.
For the last two years, he had been taking a drug called etanercept to treat Sjögren's syndrome.
The drug reduces the ability of the immune system and this limited its ability to fight infections.
Sjögren is an autoimmune disorder - a rather mysterious disease in which the body's own white blood cells attack normal tissue, as if it were an invading organism that, in this case, sowed chaos both in the glands that produce tears and saliva, and in some joints.
Weekly etanercept injections had been helpful in reducing her joint pain.
However, he knew that due to this drug, he was quite helpless in the event of a serious infection.
When the acetaminophen started to work, the patient felt much better.
The doctors at the emergency room decided to leave him overnight.
When it comes to the virus, as the doctors suspected, he will be fine the next day and he will be released home.
When Girard first heard about his new patient, he familiarized himself with infections to which people taking etanercept were susceptible.
That list was long.
Viruses cannot be cured before diagnosis, so he focused on bacterial infections.
One bacterium that attacks immunocompromised people is the food-borne listeria bacterium.
It is often found in unpasteurized milk and cheese, and causes terrible nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that it did not have.
Legionnaires' disease is another infection that is common among those who take this medicine, but did not have a cough or shortness of breath.
An even more common bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, can cause joint infections, but, again, it had no joint complaints.
Despite this, the doctor planned to start a comprehensive antibiotic treatment to cover all these risks.
However, when meeting the patient, it did not appear that he could struggle with a serious infection.
Doctors at the emergency room didn’t give him antibiotics.
The doctor had the opportunity to delay antibiotics and simply observe and wait, but if the patient had one of the infections he had read about, delaying treatment by as much as a few hours would have been fatal.
The situation was further complicated by the fact that the patient thought he was allergic to penicillin, although he did not remember what happened when he took it.
This created a shift in the risk-benefit ratio.
The traditionally low-stakes decision about whether or not to start antibiotic treatment changes when its consequences can be so dangerous.
He asked a colleague, another resident, to assess the patient.
Girard didn't tell his colleague that he was planning an antibiotic treatment, so he just asked to review the patient and give his recommendation.
He met with the patient and agreed.
Although he looked good, if he had an infection, he'd be practically defenseless against it.
The doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
Since the patient has a history of penicillin allergy, Girard should have him tested to see if he can tolerate the drug, which is not penicillin, but a close relative of it.
Girard asked for a test dose.
If he had had a serious reaction to the medicine, he would have developed a rash or had low blood pressure.
Neither of them happened.
Therefore, a total dose was administered.
A few hours later, Girard received a call.
The patient's body temperature had risen to 39 degrees.
He rushed to see the patient.
The patient's face shone with a thin layer of sweat and his cheeks were pink.
Although he seemed uncomfortable, his heart and blood pressure were fine.
The doctor thanked him for giving the patient antibiotics.
He asked for another dose of Tylenol, and when he came back to examine the patient for the last time, he slept deeply.
The fever had receded.
The sweaty glow and pink cheeks were gone.
The next night, when Girard returned to the hospital for a night shift, he first visited the patient.
He had also accepted five other patients, but this patient was the one Girard was most worried about at home after handing him over to the day's crew.
During the hours he did not see her, an organism had grown into her blood in the lab.
It was too early to say exactly what it was.
What was clear, however, was that it was a bacterium strong enough to allow Petri to grow quickly, and that it was not Staphylococcus aureus or Legionnaire’s disease.
The list of other options was long, and none of them really seemed appropriate.
It took two more days before they could finally identify the bacterium.
It was a listeria.
Girard, like everyone else who cared for the patient, was surprised.
As a doctor, you get pictures of diseases in your head.
For Girard, listeriosis was a disease derived from unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses that causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
He further worked through the material on this unusual infection and found that while people with a normal immune system may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly like a patient's colleague.
However, in pregnant women, those over 65 years of age and those with a damaged immune system, the infection can be triggered outside the gastrointestinal tract - sometimes without the usual symptoms - and can enter the bloodstream.
From there, it can spread all over your body like wildfire.
This type of infection, called invasive listeriosis, can be fatal in up to 30% of patients with it.
Indeed, although it is not as common as botulism, listeriosis can be just as deadly.
Early antibiotic treatment can save lives.
When it comes to food-borne disease, what kind of food carried that bacterium?
Although the patient and his colleague had not consumed unpasteurized milk or soft cheeses on the trip, an internet search that summer in Scotland identified an outbreak of listeria linked to smoked beef.
Neither of them ate smoked beef, but they ate a little smoked salmon.
Exactly where they picked up the bacteria was a mystery.
Once the team of doctors found out what was wrong with the patient, they were able to adjust the antibiotics.
His three-week treatment ended in July.
The doctors advised her to take it easy until the end of the summer, but by now she is feeling quite well and has returned to the museum and her beloved work.
He was praised for preventing a global cyberattack.
And then he was arrested.
When the Kronos malware was first advertised on Russian underground forums in 2014, a price of $7,000 suggested that selling the malware was a lucrative business.
Kronos was advertised as a hacking tool that can retrieve data, including usernames and passwords, ATM PINs, and personal information useful in breaking down security issues.
Motherboard reported Thursday that Hutchins was detained at Las Vegas airport after a week of visiting security conferences such as Black Hat and Defcon.
He was planning to fly back to his home in Britain.
The security community responded to the arrest of its prized star with wonder and skepticism.
Some warned that claims against Hutchins could damage the relationship between "white" hackers -- investigators who are looking for weak points in the software to identify and solve problems, not to commit crimes or sow chaos -- and law enforcement.
Others were hesitant that Hutchins could have created such software for the attack.
In July 2014, he asked on Twitter whether anyone had a sample of Kronos, a seemingly strange request when he was the author of the malware.
While the exact details of Hutchins' involvement with the Kronos malware are not clear, security researchers have often ignored legal concerns when searching for vulnerabilities in computer code.
In recent years, large tech companies have put out "mistakes" to formalize the process of reporting problems to investigators and compensating for their work.
The Defcon conference, an unrestricted gathering of security experts from around the world, has also had a strained relationship with law enforcement.
In 2002, for example, the FBI arrested a Russian cryptographer in a Las Vegas hotel room after publishing software that authorities said could compromise the security of certain types of e-books.
In a statement, the Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was concerned about Hutchins' arrest and was looking into the matter.
The WannaCry ransomware infected computers running older versions of Microsoft Windows.
After spreading, the software encrypted the computers and locked the users' files, folders, and disks.
If the infected device was connected to the network, other devices in the network could also be infected.
The attackers demanded that the victims pay hundreds of dollars to the bitcoin address.
Hutchins became an occasional hero.
In an interview with The Guardian in May, Hutchins said he registered a web domain after discovering that malicious software was trying to connect to it.
By registering the domain for $10.69, he launched a so-called kill switch that stopped the software from spreading.
His original intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who is a researcher at the Los Angeles-based cyber security firm Kryptos Logic, said in an interview that he did not go to college and has learned to write software himself.
The company did not make any comments.
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous by communicating with the media through his handle on MalwareTech, but British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was lauded in the cybersecurity community for this achievement and received special recognition at the SC Awards Europe industry event.
Senate confirms Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets, as ambassador to Britain
Johnson was the biggest financial supporter of Trump during his presidential campaign, and was named CFO of his inaugural committee in November.
A longtime Republican donor, Johnson also helped raise funds for George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney when they were party candidates.
He previously acted as Jeb Bush's financial manager during the 2016 campaign.
Johnson's great-grandfather founded Johnson & Johnson, a medical supplies company.
Formerly the United States Ambassador to Britain was Matthew Barzun.
Barzuni was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013 and resigned in January before Trump took office.
Belgian officials already knew about egg contamination in June
"We knew at the beginning of June of possible problems with the insecticide fipronil," said Katrien Stragier, spokesman for Belgium's food safety agency.
We immediately opened an investigation and told the prosecutor's office, because it may have been a fraud.
From there, the investigation became secret.
We understand that people have questions about health care and we try to answer them," Stagier added.
The AFP news agency tried to get information from the prosecutor, but he said nothing because the judge ordered the information not to be published.
Chicken eggs have been withdrawn from sale in Belgium as a precautionary measure until the results of the analyses are available.
Millions of Dutch eggs have been withdrawn from sale in the Netherlands and Germany.
German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt has called on Dutch and Belgian officials to clarify the matter quickly.
“Someone has obviously contaminated eggs with a criminally prohibited product,” Schmidt told German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Board, eggs contaminated with pesticides produced in the Netherlands are unlikely to be found in Estonia.
"According to our data, there are no Dutch eggs in Estonia," VTA spokesman Martin Altraja told BNS.
He added that there are no other products made from Dutch eggs in Estonia either.
According to Statistics Estonia, no eggs have been imported to Estonia from the Netherlands in the last 10 years.
The last time eggs were brought to Estonia from the Netherlands was in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticide fipronil has reached the hen houses as a result of an attempt by Dutch company Chickfriend to treat chickens suffering from lice.
Reports from Dutch and Belgian media that the pesticide-containing substance reached Chickfriend via a Belgian company have yet to be confirmed.
According to the World Health Organization, fipronil is moderately dangerous in larger quantities and can have adverse effects on people, especially children, kidneys, liver and thyroid.
Is there finally a solution to avoid annoying robot calls?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is often a waste of time.
His Sports City Pizza Pub in Buffalo, New York, depends on customers calling and ordering chicken wings, pizza, and potato chips.
However, much of the time these are automated messages that try to push the scam through.
"It's getting to the point where it doesn't allow other callers to reach us," said the 24-year-old bar owner.
Help is on the way, albeit slowly.
Over the past year, new tools have been added to mobile phones at the government's urging to prevent unwanted "robot calls".
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed allowing phone companies to block more spam calls and hopes to deter scammers with large fines.
According to experts, these steps are not the final solution, but they are a good start.
Federal and state non-call lists should protect people from unwanted calls from remote marketers.
But fraudsters don't care if they break the law.
Scammers reach people cheaply and easily using "automatic dialers" that automatically make a lot of calls at once.
It is estimated that Americans receive tens of millions of robot calls a day.
Of course, not all of them are fraudulent.
Pharmacies, for example, send automated messages about filling prescriptions.
But all too often the situation is this: you owe the IRS money; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; a free cruise is offered!
In addition, spammers use sophisticated technology that shows a local or important-looking number on the phone as a caller, such as the IRS.
Taking the appropriate measures for "busting" numbers would complicate fraud and save U.S. consumers millions of dollars, according to a state attorney general's group in an FCC document.
Phone companies and independent apps can sift or block unwanted calls by comparing them to known databases of problem numbers and analyzing suspicious behavior, such as a number that calls many people on non-call lists.
Wireless providers also have tools that add warnings like "Probably fraudulent" to incoming calls, but these are not available on all phones or for many customers with prepaid cards.
Verizon and Sprint can be ordered for an additional fee.
Some Android phones, including the Google Pixel, screen junk calls for free.
Media producer Jen Vargas, 39, from Orlando, Florida, said her AT&T app would tag and block certain phone calls on her mobile phone, but she has given up on phone lines.
"I very rarely accept calls from numbers I don't know," Vargas said.
Apps like YouMail and Nomorobo offer free, but limited, home phone relief.
In the case of YouMail, the operator must enable "conditional call forwarding", which forwards calls when there is no response to the line or when it is busy.
Nomorobo is not available for all home phone providers and does not work with older, copper-based phone lines.
It is also possible to buy gadgets, some of them quite crude, which block calls on home phones.
Verizon is also testing the display of suspicious call alerts on the home phone's number display.
Phone companies are already able to block certain calls that are fraudulent.
The FCC has proposed rules to formalize this type of practice and allow others to block calls suspected of fraud.
This means that Verizon can block a tax-free number that accepts calls for a fee, but will never initiate any itself.
Operators would also be able to block calls that they know are not legitimate, such as 911 area code numbers.
These rules still need to be fleshed out.
Maureen Mahoney, a public policy aspirant in the nonprofit Consumers Union, said these developments are "hopeful" but do not protect consumers from all unwanted calls.
First, non-call lists do not apply to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
In addition, according to Mahoney, FCC rules would only cover fake numbers.
Not all robot calls are designed to be tricked.
The Consumers' Association wants phone companies to make call blocking tools available to all consumers free of charge.
In the long run, the FCC supports industry efforts to confirm that the caller is really who he or she claims to be.
Perhaps one day you will be able to see a green tick on your smartphone screen if the caller is legitimate.
U.S. Telecom, a lobbyist for phone companies, says it could take several years to deploy, but it would be a powerful tool against robot ringers.
The FCC is also looking for ways to stop annoying calls being followed by consumers switching numbers.
If you sign up now for a non-call list, but get a new number later, the distributor may not know it and may start bothering you on the new line.
"The robot callers are not going anywhere," said Aaron Foss of Nomorobo, a call blocking service for mobile and home phones.
"They are criminals and will find a new way to bypass any system.
But our job is to make it as difficult as possible for them."
There are a number of logical measures that consumers should take.
Do not answer the phone if you do not know the number.
Yes, unfortunately, this is not practical for corporate call lines, as in Sports City.
Stop unwanted calls.
Do not press any buttons.
If you communicate with them, they may mark you as someone who will respond and bury you in more phone calls.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use call blocking apps.
If you have privacy concerns, check the app’s policies to see if it shares your call or contact details with distributors.
Do not provide callers with personal information, such as a bank account or social security number.
← The preparation hasn’t gone quite as I saw it
“Not everything has been exactly the way I saw it,” Mägi said about the training sessions preceding the World Cup.
Friday-Saturday are important moments that show how the body is exactly.
And the competition will show what we are going to analyse here anyway.
Today I believe that my preparation has been of high quality both this year and in previous years, so that it is possible to run normally on top of it.
Mägi has not dealt with anything special on Sunday 13.05 Estonian time.
Over the last few weeks, training has often been difficult.
I should have had the freshness, and it might be very helpful that the last week before the World Cup was a little easier.
From the physical side, the remaining days until the start go like this: yesterday the hurdler rested, today he is doing a warming workout.
However, he doesn’t want to get too absorbed in his mental preparation: “I’ve developed my own routines over time.
There's a lot of silence and peace and I don't let any rock music on my ears.
I do not need to watch any motivational videos or read self-help books, but to be here and at that moment to appreciate that athletes from all over the world have come together to compare their abilities in one place.
This in itself creates a speciality.
The World Championships are, of course, the top event of the year for every athlete, and Mägi has taken every previous start, including competitions in the Diamond League, as a test – tried some technical nuances, compared himself to a competitor.
There is no longer a chance to experiment.
"The goal here is just to run fast," says Mägi, but he adds that if you manage to keep even a percentage or a couple of energy in reserve in the run-off and potentially in the semi-final, they will definitely be useful in the next run.
The Finns held a dance party for their men.
When the first men’s dance festival was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organisers probably never dreamed that the northern neighbours would follow the example of a small Estonian town.
Today, the first Finnish men’s dance festival is held in Lapua, Western Finland.
"The representatives of the city of Lapua were so enthusiastic about the last men's dance festival in Rakvere that they wanted to organise something similar themselves," Deputy Mayor of Rakvere Kairit Pihlak said.
"This is how today there will be 2 performances of Mies-Tantssipido at Lapua baseball stadium in Finland as part of Finland's 100 festivities, where 100 men from Virumaa will also perform," said Pihlak.
According to Pihlak, this is an excellent example of good cooperation between two twin towns.
It also celebrates the jubilee years of the Republics of Estonia and Finland.
Among the hundred dancers is also the winner of the 69th Rakett season last year, Karl Reinkubjas.
"I am proud to be one of a hundred men who, through their participation in Finland, show what Viru men are capable of," he said.
"The men dancing in Rakvere have put all their joints into working order in preparation for the Finnish men's dance festival in order to show a decent level at their northern neighbours," commented Ain Suurkaev, member of Rakvere city government.
The performance of the Virumaa men has been put together by the dance ensemble Tarvanpää’s artistic director Tiiu Mürk with the well-known choir conductor Elo Üleoja.
The choreography of Estonians is based on Estonian choral music.
The first Estonian men’s dance festival was held in 2006, but the last one was held in Rakvere in 2015.
In anticipation of the finale of the evening’s discus throw: will Gerd Kanter make the history of the World Cup?
The current World Cup is the eighth for Kanter, and none of his competitors in London have achieved such an achievement.
In addition, Kanter is the only discus thrower in history to have won a full set of medals (gold, two silver and two bronze) from the World Championships.
As of today (5 August 2017), Kanter is 38 years and 92 days old.
In the event that an Estonian becomes a two-time world champion, he will become the oldest discus thrower to win a gold medal at the World Cup.
A similar possibility exists for the Polish hero Pyotr Malachowski (34 years and 60 days old).
More interesting facts:
Athletes from only two countries have won the World Discus Championships more than once.
There are nine gold medals in Germany and two in Lithuania.
The record for the World Championships is held by Virgilijus Alekna, who has been awarded 70.17 in Helsinki (in 2005).
The lowest score ever achieved was 66.20, achieved by Riedel in 1991.
The results of the study show that cockroaches also spread seeds
Like birds and mammals, cockroaches spread seeds.
These insects are known primarily as decomposers, helping to break down decaying substances under the forest.
Cockroaches also help spread the seeds.
Japanese scientists discovered that cockroaches play an important role in spreading the seeds of the forest species Monotropastrum humile.
This is an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophyll, so it is not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species gets its nutrients from fungi growing underground.
The plant sheds small, odourless and pale white fruits on the forest floor.
The fruit has very little or no taste, and Japanese researchers found that bird and mammal species are not interested in it as a source of food.
Only a handful of invertebrates consumed the pulp, and the forest beetle Blattella nipponica was the only species to regularly visit the fruit.
The researchers examined cockroach droppings to determine if these insects helped spread the plant's seeds.
The researchers found that each fecal matter ejected after eating the fruit contained an average of three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the digested seeds were viable.
Scientists assume that this unique plant species has probably learned to use the ability to propagate cockroach seeds in the course of evolution.
The fruit of the plant hangs close to the ground and ripens while the cockroaches emerge from their larval stage.
The researchers published their findings this week in the journal Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.
"Given that approximately 4,600 species of cockroaches have been identified so far, seed dispersal through cockroaches may be a much more extensive and so far simply undocumented mechanism, not just the unique ability of a particular plant species to exploit cockroaches," said Naoto Sugiura, an associate professor at Kumamoto University.
"The findings are expected to encourage people to pay more attention to the relationship between plants and cockroaches and to look for further examples of how cockroaches spread seeds."
The Duchess of Cambridge's childhood friend should have had the "right to die"
A childhood friend of the Duchess of Cambridge should have been allowed to end her life, according to her mother.
Isobel Kennerley, a member of the Duchess's tour guide group, pleaded with her after three years of fighting a brain tumor that caused her "extreme pain, suffering and loss of dignity" to be allowed to die.
A 34-year-old woman with cerebral palsy was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2014, but she suffered terribly, according to her mother, before she finally died in May.
Christine Eeley, 65, of Berks, Newbury, has called for a law that would allow people suffering from a deadly disease and mentally competent people to "control the manner and timing" of their deaths.
She said her daughter's painful death caused her "serious trauma", and wished the law had allowed her to put in place a plan that would have allowed her daughter to die with dignity if her condition worsened.
China’s internet censors are playing a tricky game of cat and mouse
According to experts, the shift, which could affect a large number of users, from researchers to companies, suggests that China is increasingly concerned about the power of the internet.
“The restrictions seem to be intensifying, but at the same time, the internet is more powerful than ever,” said Emily Parker, author of Now I Know Who My Comrades Are, a book about the power of the internet in China, Cuba and Russia.
Beijing’s restrictions on the internet are proportionate to China’s influence on the internet.
According to experts, China has not yet strengthened control to the maximum, and in many cases the game of cat and mouse continues.
One day after Apple’s move last week, people began spreading Chinese social media a way to get access to these tools that are so simple that even a tech stranger can.
This included registering a human app store in another country where VPN apps are still available.
However, the test on Thursday shows that China wants to change the game in favor of the cat.
A number of Chinese internet service providers said Thursday on their social media accounts, websites or emails that Chinese security officials are testing a new way to find the internet addresses of services that host or use illegal content.
When they are found, authorities, according to these companies, are asking Internet service providers to require their customers to stop doing so.
If customers continue, service providers and Chinese officials will disconnect them within minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to the faxed inquiry.
Studies suggest that tens to hundreds of millions of people in China use VPNs and other types of software to get past the Great Firewall.
While foreign TV shows and pornography block many people away, they present only minor challenges to China’s vast online community.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has been responsible for new internet controls over the years, but he has also highlighted technology and the internet as critical factors for China's future economic development.
As cyberspace has begun to play a more central role in everything that happens in China, government controls have evolved.
It is difficult to determine the extent of the new endeavors, as many users and companies do not discuss them publicly, fearing that they will be discredited by the Chinese government.
However, some frequent users have said that it is becoming more and more difficult to bypass the restrictions.
One student, studying in the United States and returning to China to spend the summer vacation, said his local VPN had been blocked.
She said she took this period as a kind of meditation away from social media and left a message on Facebook to her friends to explain why she had fallen to the ground.
A graduate student at one of China’s universities for environmental engineering said that without Google, research has become more difficult, even though the university has found alternative publications that students don’t always need the internet.
He claims he has now found a new way to bypass the Great Firewall without revealing what it is.
According to Chinese internet observers, some VPNs are still working and much more could be done by China to intensify the restrictions.
"We believe that if the government had decided to do this, it would have stopped using VPN much more by now," said VPNDada, a spokesperson for a website created in 2015 to help Chinese users find working VPNs.
"If the government sent out more cats, it would be much more difficult for the mice," said a spokesman, who refused to name himself in China because of the group's delicacy.
"Obviously they didn't because they have to give people or companies a little bit of breathing space."
Online restrictions in China are often cyclical.
The current climate is partly due to the upcoming important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, which will be held in the autumn of the 19th party congress.
Five years ago, before a similar encounter, VPNs were hit by unforeseen interruptions at the time.
Like economic policy or foreign affairs, censorship in China is part of a complex and often incomplete political process.
Analysts say government ministries feel pressure ahead of the party congress to show they are effective and can intervene if there is a problem.
“So it’s definitely not an apocalypse for VPNs,” said Paul Triolo, head of global technology at Eurasia Group.
"A more complex environment for users to navigate, and new capabilities and approaches, will simply allow China to better switch off certain parts of VPN usage at a time and place chosen by Beijing," he said.
The Chinese population is learning to cope with these difficulties at an earlier age.
Earlier this summer, Chinese internet giant Tencent began limiting the amount of time it takes for people under the age of 18 to play the popular online game "Honor of Kings", allowing them to do so for an hour a day for those under the age of 12, and for two hours for those between the ages of 12 and 18.
This is why young people in China have started using an age-old solution - fake documents.
"Will Your 'Honor of Kings' Play Time Be Restricted?
Are you interested in getting a document that shows that you are over 18?" asked a recent ad on Chinese social media.
"No problem.
Get in touch to get a document cheaply."
Estonian heavy-duty horses will be assessed at the Agricultural Museum tomorrow
This Saturday, 5 August, the Estonian Heavy Transport Horse Day will take place at the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The Estonian heavy-duty horse is one of the three breeds of Estonian horses next to the Estonian horse and tori horse.
This year, the heavy-duty horse day will take place for the 23rd time and a total of 17 heavy-duty horses from all over Estonia will arrive for the workhorse year event.
On this day, young Estonian heavy-duty horses, stallions and mares are compared and evaluated.
In addition, the work done by the best breeders is recognized.
As a endangered breed, there are over 350 Estonian heavy-duty horses in total.
The preservation of the breed and the use of horses are also introduced at Ülenurm.
On the same day, it is possible to visit the exhibitions of the Estonian Agricultural Museum, get acquainted with Estonia’s 100 grain beds and rye fields, and participate in thematic workshops.
Visitors of all ages will find something for themselves.
There are exciting games for children, the opportunity to ride a pony or horse, participate in a drawing competition and visit the Three Pigs Science Theatre.
There will also be a summer event where Estonian food and handicraft products will be offered.
The Estonian Heavy Horse Day is organised jointly with the Estonian Horse Breeders’ Society, the Estonian Heavy Horse Breeders’ Association and the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
Breeders are supported by the Estonian Breeding Association.
Genie was named Cat of the Year
The rescued cat, who was supportive of its owner during the course of the bone cancer treatment, was named State Cat of the Year.
Genie was recognized for comforting her owner, Lincoln native Evie Henderson, through six chemotherapy sessions.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016, and Genie’s company said it helped her manage several painful surgeries and time spent in hospital.
The cat was recognized by the cat charity Cats Protection at a ceremony in London.
Image caption: Evie says cat helped her when she lost her long brown hair due to chemotherapy
"I think he's the best.
He deserves it.
He's always been there for me," Evie said.
"He came to my leg in plaster and sat next to my feet.
He sniffed the plaster and then jumped on the couch to pat me on the knee with his paws.
When I was too sick to visit friends or to go out, and had to sit at home, she came to me and it made me much happier, offering a lot of comfort."
According to Evie, she has a special bond with her pet, which was a huge support for her when she lost her hair due to the debilitating treatment.
"It made me very upset because I had long brown hair.
But since it was spring, Genie was wearing the same hair, and losing my hair and Genie’s was a bit of a shock relief.”
Evie's father, Chris Henderson, said the cat had been a "great distraction" and described how Evie used to watch videos of her beloved pet in a hospital bed.
"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it offered her something to look forward to when she got home for a few precious days."
The 11-year-old said, "I missed her every day when I was in the hospital, and my family said she misses me too.

Mueller called a grand jury in Russia investigation
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that a grand jury has been convened by a special prosecutor investigating possible ties between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The grand jury is a new and significant step forward in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump or his key advisers conspired with Moscow to advance the 2016 Republican presidential campaign.
NBC News has previously reported that before Mueller, the former director of the FBI who now runs this critical investigation, had been appointed, state prosecutors had used jurors as part of an investigation into the activities of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.
One of the president's personal lawyers, John Dowd, told NBC News that he was unaware that Mueller had begun using the grand jury.
“We’ve been working with Bob Mueller and his team since June 1st because we want to get this over with,” he said.
"In light of the news of the convocation of the Federal grand jury, we have no reason to believe that President Trump is under investigation."
NBC News has not independently confirmed the Journal's data.
The use of a jury collection is a common part of complex investigation and is not a tool designed to only listen to testimony, but also to extract information and retrieve data from individuals or companies.
It is a powerful tool that prosecutors can use to pursue charges and subpoenas, and it may suggest that Mueller's work is still far from being done.
Trump has denied that he or any member of his team had any plans with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also denied playing a role in Trump’s surprising victory last November.
The president's special adviser, Ty Cobb, said he was unaware that Mr Mueller had begun to use the new grand jury.
"Associations with the jury are usually secret," Cobb said in a statement.
The White House is in favor of anything that will speed up the fair completion of his work.
The White House is fully committed to working with Mueller.
Former FBI Director Jim Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed."
"The Flying American" under the black sail
Of course, I've heard of "flying" ships.
Who wouldn't be?
There are several times a day between Helsinki and Tallinn.
It's nothing special.
The Swiss company Supramar brought the first "foiliva" boat, the Freccia d'Oro or the Golden Arrow, to the market in 1952.
Technology existed before, but now I have a wind-powered vessel.
Catamaran, yes, but still a sailboat.
With what formula should it take off?
However, let us spare ourselves the formula (it is not difficult to find it) and take a simple peasant look at the concept of "foiling".
Why do airplanes stay in the air?
The shape of the wing is such that when the plane swoops forward at high speed, the air flowing under and over the wing at different speeds creates aerodynamic lift due to the difference in pressure, at one point it exceeds the weight of the aircraft and lifts the whole machine into the air.
The same process happens in the water.
The right-shaped wing creates lift when moving at high speed, which in turn lifts the “winged” base out of the water.
Easy, isn't it?
It gets complicated when you get to the numbers.
The aircraft requires a minimum speed of 150-250 km/h to take off, the current world record for sailing speed is "only" 121.1 km/h.
But let's not get bogged down in high school physics!
Today I have come to see the "flying" catamaran, which is called NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
NACRA comes from the initials of the North American Catamaran Racing Association.
FCS is short for Flight Control System.
It is a system that allows the crew to set the base even in the middle of the "fly", and 20 indicates the length of the sailboat in the legs.
As soon as the catamaran is released, it's clear it's not a Gentleman's Sunday sailboat.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sametvest stayed at the wharf today.
Pippi and Glasses couldn't fit on board.
This is hardcore.
That's Speed in the Cube.
"That's carbon fiber?" I ask, pointing to the sail.
Yeah, it's all carbon fiber.
“The whole thing?” I don’t really understand.
"No, the whole boat," sounds like a close answer.
170 kilos - the three of us going on board will definitely weigh more than 170 kilos in total.
I compare everything from laundry soap to night-time cars, and you can't even get around it here - the NACRA F20 is like a rind weapon that's not suitable for street driving.
Pagani Zonda R or Ferrari FXX.
Built with one goal in mind - to drive well-quickly in controlled conditions.
A hobby sailor would also be surprised by the amount of safety equipment that has to be put on before going to sea.
Waterproof suit, interlocks, special gripping boots, sail gloves, harness, special life jacket, helmet.
In combat equipment, you get the feeling that an oxygen tank could go colonizing Mars as well and as well as the sea.
“Is there a good chance?” he asked in a humorous tone.
"Yes," sounds like a short answer.
"You've been around a lot?" I probed the surface further.
Okay, this is not going to be a joke.
I fasten my seat belt.
The purposefulness is also underlined by the fact that the Nacra F20 FCS needs a auxiliary boat and a minimum of two crew members to reach the sea.
A maximum of three, so there's not much room for play.
Why is it not a Sunday cruise?
Leili Metsalolood " Blog Archive " Repair works of lands and roads
As a former occupation, all kinds of land improvement work will inevitably catch my eye even now, be it in the forest or in the field.
Machines and the quality of work have improved significantly and everything is happening faster than in its own time.
Currently, the site is mainly being reconstructed, errors and blockages are being sought and repaired.
More stringent environmental requirements have been added, which were not addressed decades ago.
Building materials have been renewed, for example, plastic pipes are now used instead of the earlier reinforced concrete pipes, and fabric, so-called geotextile, is used to secure the trench ridges in addition to stones.
In the past, estuaries and culverts were secured with cast concrete slabs (MP, VKP) and sods.
In order to protect the environment, before draining water (underground drains, ditches) reaches natural streams or rivers, sediment ponds are dug, which should clear the water of possible agricultural fertilizers and poisons.
Wolf bats are often planted at the bottom of new sediment pools or ponds, or they begin to grow on their own from the seeds that have flown there.
Wolves have the ability to filter out toxic substances from the water.
The pond in the picture was excavated last year and this week the soil on the pond was smoothed flat, a well of concrete rings was built to take the fire water.
And in order for some machine not to crash into the pond, it is likely that big rocks were dragged to the side of the site.
In addition to clearing the field ditches, forest roads are being improved.
The forest section in the picture should be part of the municipality, which also receives additional gravel cover.
To the right is the state forest, the road to be reconstructed will continue immediately to the right of the dump truck, which will soon be completed.
The left has a private forest.
The municipality road continues and the renovation of the field ditches and roads and the improvement of the drainage faults that have become apparent are also ongoing.
