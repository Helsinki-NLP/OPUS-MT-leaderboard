Four members of Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, in Spain, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group, who is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Three suspects arrested in Estonia were also taken into custody by the court yesterday.
They are suspected to be members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organization, aged 27-57, who mainly commit drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal organisation has been arrested in Mijas, in the province of Malaga, Spain.
Three men were arrested as suspects in Estonia, one of them is a leading figure in a criminal organisation and two of them are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected suggests that there was a clear division of tasks and roles within the criminal organisation.
The aim of the activities of the criminal association was to commit drug offences and thereby earn criminal income,” commented Vahur Verte, the head of the pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been previously targeted by law enforcement agencies, and some of them have served sentences for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," Verte said.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police department, said that the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation lasting nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was realised and we were simultaneously detained in Estonia and Spain on suspicion of crimes," he said.
Leis added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in the detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we will be able to catch them from the other side of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the suspects may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
The man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized in order to secure confiscation in this criminal case.
Pre-trial proceedings are conducted by the Central Criminal Police’s Office for Organized Crimes and are headed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s, when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and charged businessmen a monthly roofing tax.
Joint international operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and final judicial decisions confirm the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime.
For example, recent court judgments, eight defendants separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev criminal association, from whom the proceeds of the crime were confiscated, or a court judgment against nine persons in that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 that was aimed at the illegal trade of contraband cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Ida-Viru County and Southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal income there is approximately 71,500 euros.
The success of these criminal cases has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information with foreign colleagues every day and prosecutors exchange evidence and, if necessary, carry out operations together in any country of the European Union.
Civil Rights Group Warns of Travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri against state discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group said in a statement: "The NAACP travel statement issued for Missouri State, effective until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to be particularly vigilant and extremely cautious when moving around the state given a series of suspicious race-based events that have recently occurred across the state and are listed here."
According to the NAACP, the group was urged to issue a travel warning by both a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination-related lawsuits, and the fact that state law enforcement targets unequally largely minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the edge of the road because of the color of their skin, they are beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, to The Kansas City Star newspaper.
"We've never received complaints that close before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black student from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with the crime.
In addition, the note points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General that shows that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped in the state than white drivers.
"The note is designed to make people aware and alert their families, friends, and coworkers to what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's to bring bail money or to inform relatives that they're going through the state."
Based on the latest data from the FBI’s Hate Crime Reporting Program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, ranking the state 16th in terms of the number of hate crimes committed across the state.
The travel warning is also in response to Missouri's new law making it difficult for the company to sue for discrimination in seeking housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, this increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun using this measure in response to certain U.S. domestic laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what should everyone know about the different forms of this difficult disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C can progress to liver cirrhosis, i.e. wrinkled liver and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Health Board, says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of hepatitis – fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, greyish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The latter also comes from the popular name of inflammation of the liver, jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can progress without symptoms.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined from laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can transition to chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without symptoms, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuuso Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, having sex, passing stools from hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, entering the mouth, and using drugs.
The risk group of hepatitis A infection includes the family members and caregivers of the patient, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with the infected person, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travellers to countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
The infection can be prevented by vaccination, especially for people who travel a lot and are at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to comply with daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items (tooth brushes, shaving tools), having sex with a donor blood, having sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and having hepatitis from a sick mother to a fetus/newborn child.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, the newborn of an infected mother, family members and caregivers of a sick person, health care workers exposed to blood and other body fluids, rescue workers and police officers, and travellers visiting countries with high rates of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharp tools and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms in case of constipated sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation programme in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items, having sex with a donor blood, having sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a sick mother to a fetus/newborn child.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, the newborn of an infected mother, family members and caregivers of a sick person, health care workers exposed to blood and other body fluids, rescue workers and police officers, HIV-infected persons, and travellers visiting countries with high rates of hepatitis C.
The preventive measures for hepatitis C are: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharp tools and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Because of this, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread by contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringes and needles, sexually and infrequently from infected mother to fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people with no immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from becoming infected with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread by faecal-oral route through drinking water and food, including low heat-treated beef, fish and clams, donor blood, shared syringes, and from infected mother to fetus.
Passengers can become infected in countries with high rates of hepatitis E.
Preventive measures for hepatitis E are compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the sick.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating a little cooked beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and avoid using drugs.
Although in the final round the competitors tried to knock out the four-time Olympic champion, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final lap and won with a time of 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, dragging her husband Tania and children along after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be on the track with them," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the fifth consecutive gold double of the 5,000 and 10,000 meter races in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's The Lady in Gold, the extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait, takes a much deeper look at the origins of one piece of art in late 19th- and early 20th-century Vienna cultural life.
But even more so in history.
The awe-inspiring amount of information might have needed a harder cut axe, a narrower subject would have allowed the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title to have more influence.
At the moment, there are two books between the covers: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in her painting The Lady in Gold, and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about respectable Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes us into the midst of a vibrant cultural life in Vienna, and those in the Austrian capital can easily imagine how life around Ringstrasse went more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads when Klimt came in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see a familiar name in the book, you feel more cultured.
However, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where syphilis was incurable and had the highest suicide rate in Europe does not seem to add anything to the story.
Or, perhaps, every brush stroke adds colour to early 20th century cultural life in Vienna.
Dreaming of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten people living in Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch twice and posed for Klimt for his famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele wasn't drawn to the glamorous life she belonged to.
When you look at The Lady in Gold, it is hard to believe that towards the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the latter was the hottest painter of the moment in Vienna.
Klimt’s order cost 4,000 kroons at the time, a quarter of the price of a well-located country house.
The fact that in some portraits the master's affair with the model was suspected did not deter the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that emerged during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The Lady in the Gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer’s portrait”, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before her work with Adele began, Klimt had been to the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics seen there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Lady in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and at about the same time (from 1907 to 1908) another gold painting, "Kiss", was born.
Art historians did not overlook the similarity between the two women.
What does Hitler have to do with it?
"I think that in memory of my friend Klimt I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and requested that their family's Klimt collection go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had a second portrait of Adele.
In her will (Adele left in February 1925), she also asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four landscape paintings by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
He bequeathed his jewelry to his nieces Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed the drawing exam.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to the fact that he was not accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were in fact Jewish.
In any case, the Austrian Gallery’s task, referred to in Maria’s will, had changed considerably by 1939 – it had become important to find suitable works for the Nazi party in Vienna’s rich collections of Jewish art.
Some of Adele’s works in the home were also included in Hitler’s personal art collection, but not Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art heists, a ten-year legal dispute began between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
It should be noted that if you can see “Kiss” at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer’s “Lady in Gold” must be visited at the Neue Gallery in New York City.
Before you go to Vienna, read the above book.
Even if you don’t plan to go see Klimt’s work, at least my emotions revolved more around the Nazi and Jewish theme after the book’s closure than the $135 million-selling painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, but rather the fate of the family - and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree at the beginning of the book made it considerably easier to navigate events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In swimming, Gold was very close to his own 200 m backstroke personal record by swimming 2.16,62.
The peak mark dates back to a week ago, when the time of 2.16.58 at the Canadian Junior Championships.
Gold finished last, or tenth, in the A-finals.
In the final, he completed the distance with a time of 2.15.76, and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top brand.
Gold’s Estonian record (2.15.13) was slightly more than half a second behind Alina Kendzior.
In the Estonian all-time rankings, Gold rose to third place and her fresh personal top mark is the fifth-ever result for Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming stages of the Canadian Adult Championships.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold also made successful starts there.
She won the silver medal in the 200 m freestyle with a time of 2.03.22.
The last time this distance was swam by an Estonian woman was in 2008.
Only Elina Partyka, the Estonian record-holder, has swam this distance faster than Gold.
An Estonian living in Canada, she also won a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with an excellent personal record and the top mark of the new Estonian season, 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has only swam one hundredth faster.
He reached his personal peak in the 100 m backstroke in the opening turn of the relay swim with a time of 1.03.69.
He finished in seventh place at half-time when he swam 2.17.31 in the final.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth
The holiday season is here, and that means relaxing for US President Donald Trump.
However, as Trump has been one of the most vacationing presidents to date, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to CNN and USA Today, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Even though the president’s holiday started yesterday, Trump’s opponents have been talking about the holiday for a week.
They accuse Trump of getting too much rest.
It is customary for the president to spend weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
George W. Bush, for example, had been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama had been on vacation for only 21 days.
However, Trump is quick to forget things.
Days after becoming president, Trump said on 60 Minutes that there would be no time for long vacations because there was so much to do.
He also expressed displeasure three years ago over Barack Obama's leave.
The president tweeted: “While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting the heads of journalists.”
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not a relaxation.
This is officially referred to as a “working holiday,” during which Trump has no time for reading or other pleasurable activities.
There had to be another reason for the holiday.
The air-conditioning system will be replaced in the West Wing of the White House and all personnel will have to leave.
The west wing also houses the Oval Office and other offices of the President.
“I don’t think any of you would want to be on the West Wing in August if it’s 38 degrees and there’s no air conditioning,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
Where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you will get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not run for state office if you do not tolerate criticism from voters
The father of our country knew a lot about unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him up for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech could be taken away from us, and silently and silently we could be led to slaughter like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
Earlier this week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The governor's office dismissed the lawsuit, and online commentaries abounded with counter-reactions in the style of "Who Cares?".
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an incredibly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
His approval rating is the second-best among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a thoughtless, responsive figurehead.
He has led the state with a firm hand and he has remained firm on his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook rather skillfully as a key tool in his dealings with his constituents, for example, by presenting his bald head cheerfully for the first time since chemotherapy.
Thus, the Governor's Page, an official-labeled public forum operated by staff paid by taxpayers' dollars to block visiting people, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s behavior, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spammers, or angry crowds.
The Post had a conversation with several real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they are, real people who communicate with their elected leaders, a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasising Hogan's Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not incite anger, but real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post's news story in the comment section.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, someone will immediately call it a ‘collective effort’ instead of acknowledging that it’s a large group of concerned citizens.”
What the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack," others would probably call "public support."
The Facebook era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it used to be when workers had to be sent out to collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest the protesters and shut them up.
But that’s exactly what’s happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for flouting Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark judgments on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment to the Constitution when she blocked a voter from her Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington’s time, affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers thumped his way of running.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Yuricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, leveling Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected by the online George Washington Letter Collection Project, his office was buried under petitions criticizing his views on friendship, trade, and shipping deals with Britain.
But he didn't make them keep quiet.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty Hopes for Home Territory Comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes for home territory comfort in the next three days as the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern Irishman, who was in the lead on the neighboring Archerfield Links lanes last year before he surrendered to Paul Eales, is fond of the new venue and fills the role of tournament ambassador instead of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built and now we see the club shine in all its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players see the track at its best, it's in a brilliant condition.
Jerry's done a great job setting this place up.
He is an avid supporter of golf and takes pride in what he has achieved.
This allows the track to be presented perfectly."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said a player at Southport.
“I couldn’t defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off my calendar a year after I won.
It's magical to come back to this area.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always have in our hearts.”
Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour earlier this year when he turned 50, will also return to the competition.
It is her first event in Scotland since attending the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"It's always a little more meaningful to play at home," said Orr, a man from Helensburgh.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel the added pressure.
I’ve enjoyed playing golf and played a lot of golf.
I’m happy with things so far.”
The trio will be joined on the field by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six match-winning Scotsmen, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, and parking costs £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s gold-rich land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
He rarely even uses the pot.
In a wooden cabin in the rugged Papuan province of Paniai, the capital of Enarotali, a housewife places a batat called a nota in the local language right on the fire.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the fire and eagerly eaten with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on a muddy floor without any furniture, where he does his daily chores, such as washing with cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet role is filled by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Being the youngest of her husband's four wives, she is not assigned to care for any of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, plus there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to visit after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
It is a rare sighting of the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed by Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum that saw only 1,026 elderly people forced to vote before the eyes of the occupying forces.
The movement, which was pushing the Dutch out of power, quickly turned its fury against the Jakarta government, which is still keeping the region under its strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is both a remote and an abandoned place. To get here, you need to fly from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire for 90 minutes and then go on a five-hour trek in a rental car.
There is no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the city is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by corrugated iron roofs, whose rust has turned different shades of yellow-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, and hardly any foreigners have come here.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the papaya of Honey Pago worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing clothes like that,” says Degei, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse, and bright skirt.
"Before that, we only wore plant leaves on our body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also a gold-rich country in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Paniai, a mountainous province about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000, Grasberg is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix-based company.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about US$3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua can boast supplies of hardwood, worth an estimated US$78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of papaya suffering as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid approximately US$20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to US$150,000 to one officer.
Papuans' efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are ruthlessly manipulated.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing in the highlands belonging to the Papuan tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 peaceful protesters in the area.
The Birsbane archdiocese's 2016 report "We Are Losing Everything" includes testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly common) and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victims is hard to count because such incidents happen every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened because Papua’s natural resources have caused an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia’s crowded islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javanese family canteens sell crispy chicken and mixed-vegetable gado-gado served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables at a traditional market cheaper than local poppies,” explains Paniais-born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital for work.
"Paapua mama-mamas [women], who live in oil, will therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won 27 of Papua's 29 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he will live up to our hopes of restoring justice," You says.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was in a slump.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali sang Christmas carols at a fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle out of darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the drunken soldiers chased the children and beat them with the handles of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire, and things escalated further the next day.
Around 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting vibes and performed a waita-dance of the Papuan honey pago tribe, during which a circle was run and a bird song was imitated.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military personnel.
"If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, but not issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, an elder in the Kego Koto district of the city of Enarotal, sensed the impending threat and called for peace by asking the crowd to go home.
No one had the will to listen.
"Turning around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine in his bright colors on the porch of a tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
“It was a lot of people,” he added.
Local man Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to his cousin.
“I ran over to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Yohanes told TIME magazine.
"I saw that he was dead...I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the security of their precinct as it was attacked.
“We must protect ourselves if we are to be killed,” said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a Papuan police spokesman.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura where he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the crimes against human rights that occurred.
There were excuses almost immediately.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
“The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes,” he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto retracted his remarks, saying he had no intention of creating a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said that "everything will be resolved by law".
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including what happened in Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai accepted such claims with gloomy distrust.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the Paniai people are afraid to dissect this incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot dead villagers in Paniai's neighboring district of Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, as a result of a dispute between villagers and the manager of a construction company, who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the policemen, to which the latter responded with warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
“We were in a big panic, we were afraid of revenge,” said 29-year-old Domingo Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injuries.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and for the police mobile brigade to be pulled back from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the honey, mon, dan and damal tribes living in Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many of them have joined the rebel army of the Free Papuan Movement (VPL), which claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by organising sporadic attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "protecting national sovereignty", the military has arrested Paniais in recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty breeds discontent.
The lack of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their food by themselves mainly sweet potatoes, plus a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest being sold at the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has deepened between indigenous Papuans and new migrants who have been arriving in large numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
“Young people are not interested in staying because there are neither jobs nor money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because "they did not observe the relevant practices", although they had been granted a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy head of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"Journalists attempting to report on Indonesia from the most easterly troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua face new risks of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a piercing glance from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's close neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries, Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands, urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "miscellaneous large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so evidence of human rights cases would be hard to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When a Dutch delegation led by the country’s human rights envoy Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence, saying they wanted to remain anonymous, urging: “We want freedom.”
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," says tribal council chairman Hobai.
He wants Jokow to understand that, in addition to living under constant threat from the predatory military, the Paniai people are suffering from poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to be a debt to be paid.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of Paniai’s shooting victims survived the final symbolic insurrection by burying the body of one of the victims in a land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
The fire consumed the Dubai Torch for the second time.
The fire swept through one of the tallest residential towers in the world on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high and 79-story building.
This is the second fire to have ravaged a high-rise in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," one resident, who called himself George, told Reuters.
According to Dubai's civil protection officials, firefighters extinguished the flame around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident could again raise questions about the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation conducted by the Torch Board in the wake of the 2015 fire found that the facade covering suffered the most damage - decorative panels on the exterior and insulation.
British police have said they believe the insulation and façade panels at London’s Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed around 80 people.
See: These phones are likely to become bestsellers in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will reveal their new top models.
In spring, the Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium went on sale.
According to Tele2’s Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, this year’s flagships are characterized by innovative design, iris scanner, edge-to-edge 4K resolution display and ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales ranking, caused great excitement in the world of technology.
Autumn promises even faster fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera and greater water and dust resistance for smart enthusiasts.
He added that based on the rumours, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict the four top models that will probably conquer this year’s sales charts.
These top four smartphone models will hit the shelves in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to arrive in stores as early as mid-September.
Rumors of what the new Apple model will look like and what to do with it are spreading.
While the iPhone 7 didn’t make any significant difference next to the iPhone 6s, Apple’s 10th birthday is expected to see the new model stand out completely from the previous ones.
Four colors have been mentioned: black, white, rose gold, and chrome.
One element of the new design is probably the screen covering the entire front of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
JonyIve, Apple's design manager, insists that the new iPhone model looks like smooth glass.
There is also a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the iris scanner, wireless charging and even higher quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
This is definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-orders for the all-new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There’s been a lot of speculation about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It’s been said that the S Pen is designed for even more business users and offers even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrower field-of-view telephoto lens.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first trial, which is definitely comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
We look forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has launched three smartphones this year, the Nokia 6 is still missing its flagship, the Nokia 8, which will be launched on August 16.
We expect a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display from Nokia and a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminum housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, the new Nokia model has two rear cameras, which are produced by the company Zeiss.
While Sony’s flagship has so far been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future with even more innovative features.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but with at least as good or better camera.
Sony's new model has been speculated to have a screen of at least six inches.
What brings us to reality, we will see very soon, as Sony has traditionally unveiled its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which takes place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico over paying for border wall
The Washington Post has released transcripts of phone calls between President Donald Trump and the heads of state of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop declaring that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president scolded him for publicly condemning the wall, saying, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump vowed to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange of ideas.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the U.S. would take on refugees going to Australia is "ridiculous", "stupid" and "stupid". He argued that the deal, which was made during Obama's administration, would leave him with the impression of a "dumb card" because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call by informing Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not discuss the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their bid for the procurement of bus service from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive that rejected the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid on the Tartu bus procurement, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is a public bus service procurement within the City of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liinid appealed the decision of Tartu Circuit Court to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court did not deal with it.
Although many on social media complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their sleep and the whole city is full of partying drunks, there are also many who have nothing bad to say about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I was surprised to find that the shop was so nice!
I didn't see any blurry being or rudeness.
I even saw kindness,” says Laine.
“It’s nice to be here, to be and to be happy about Pärnu, which has been hibernated in the winter,” he adds cheerfully.
The noise from the beach doesn’t bother me.
While living in the city centre, he still heard music being played on the beach, now the music has not yet reached his home walls.
"But I hope I hear," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who spoke to Õhtuleht, says that the festival is rather good for Pärnu – it helps the local merchants a lot.
He is also pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The noise of parties doesn't bother a woman.
Although I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach has come alive.
And it’s good that people are moving, and it’s been that way three times already,” she says.
I think it was a little worse the first time.
"There may have been complaints," he ponders.
However, the noise on the beach is common for summer residents.
“This weekend is a very good promotion for our small town,” says Harri, who is based in the park.
The noise and the turmoil have not shaken his rhythm either.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
The man of loud music will not be crushed.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live near there.
"Good people can stick together and there's no trouble," he says.
The guests who came to Pärnu are polite, he says.
“Of course, they’re a little overdoing the bottles, but the kids are young and oh my God – let’s go, but be human and we’ll make it,” he says.
The residents of the beach have travelled somewhere by then, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
“But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life – people like this kind of noise,” Tiina, who has been walking with children in Pärnu, says.
His family’s sleep is not disturbed by the festival music either, although last year it sounded even further away from this year.
Last summer the stage was different, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, so it actually sounds pretty good on the far side of the Pärnu River,” he says.
Pearson Cuts 3,000 Jobs and Dividends to Revive Business
Pearson, a British education company, said Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividends by 72 percent, triggering another restructuring programme to address the business's impending plight.
The loss of jobs, which according to CEO John Fallon is likely to be made redundant in late 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4,000 jobs lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by an additional £300 million (US$394 million) under its third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid digital shift.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner firm Bertelsmann, said their expectation for the year had not changed since a reported 1-percent increase in revenue to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Warm weather continues on Sunday.
In Estonia, summer-warm weather with the possibility of rainstorms will come on Sunday, and wind gusts will be very strong at times.
At night, the weather is cloudy in Estonia.
There may be rain in some areas, but there may be rain.
Southwest and west winds 5-11, gusts up to 14, islands and coasts up to 18 m/s.
The air temperature is 13-17 degrees.
The day will come with alternating clouds.
In many places it rains, in some places lightning is possible.
Southwest winds 6-12, gusts up to 15, islands and coasts up to 20 m/s.
The air temperature is 18-21 degrees.
Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked "with a man-made self-made explosive device."
According to the statement, all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airfield.
According to correspondents, the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), are a growing force in Qarabagh as a serious source of concern for NATO forces based in Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people mainly in the Shiite district of Kabul.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack in the city centre killed more than 150 people - the most deadly military attack in the country since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while United States President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country's military and police.
Respondents said the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA cancels decision to postpone smog order after lawsuits
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reversed its decision to delay a Obama-era decree requiring states to limit smog emissions one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to resume "Ozone Determination Operations for 2015" late Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue with and listen to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced EPA’s intention to delay ozone measurements, which measure smog pollution in different parts of the country, to determine where its levels should be reduced by one year to meet stricter air quality standards.
Fifteen mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying the ruling was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, saying it is part of a broader plan to boost economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked backlash among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA's website states that inhaling ozone-containing air "can reduce lung capacity and increase the risk of respiratory disease," such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle could have a party as heavy rains threaten the crops of the EU’s second largest wheat producer.
This year it may be that weeks of rain before the harvest means that the fruit intended for the bread industry is suitable only for animal feed.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could be used for animal feed, which is double the usual rate, Agravis said.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
At first, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heat wave.
In July, Germany was hit by rainstorms, which have continued into August.
The eyes of many have been turned to northern Germany, where rain hinders harvest.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
Harvesting has not even started in most of the region, a local harvest collector in Ceravi reported.
"It's going to be a pretty tough time," said senior salesman Frank Deckert of Ceravis in Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, perhaps the clever tricks of Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fairhouses, as the magnificent views of many (life) rooms reach the shores of Saimaa through the large windows.
At every turn, our northern neighbours strive to create crisp and perfect (energy-efficient) homes at the same time.
It is worth admiring and also admiring the use of wood by Finns as a building and finishing material, in the manufacture of furniture and decorative goods.
Both the builder and (home) designer will find exhilarating techniques and smart solutions in fair houses.
It is clear that black, white and grey shade combinations, when complemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very entertaining.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, as the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
On the night of today, the line was drawn down to this year’s Weekend Festival Baltic and Martin Garrix did his best to be remembered as the last performer on the main stage.
The crowd was really turning around during Garrix’s performance – singing, huilating, dancing in a self-forgetting way.
When Garrix finished, the mass was scattered from Pärnu beach to the city.
We bring you a gallery with all the photos our photographer captured during the three days of the weekend.
If you are one of them, find yourself.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face off in the most attractive boxing match of the near future, in the 66.7 kg weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the featherweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
Following Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are ranked in the top five.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for the photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be "a perfect measure".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up to [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to go downhill.
And he's going to have to go up to a light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans wanted it.
Let's give it to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing World Needs This Fight".
Klimas raised the question of whether to watch it for a fee. This is part of his strategy to have Lomachenko debut in the 61.2 kg class towards the end of this year, to make it possible to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) by next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their Lightweight title round Forum on 23 September.
"Watching this fight could be rewarding, as fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the key players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they’re ready...”
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "powerful fighter" and could go watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that he thought the three division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout".
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the punch strength and then box.
They both said they felt the tension between them grow.
“This is a battle that is waiting to be fought.
No other confrontation generates so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight."
Which parts of the world are moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or stay with their families.
For example, last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6,702 foreigners, but last year the number was 4,928.
The authorities do not know how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
If about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ago, then in recent years the number is approaching 2,000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis – in 2014, 1,087 people received a temporary residence permit, the year before 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most in Estonia – last year, more than 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than left.
“The Ukrainian community has always been big in Estonia, and due to the complicated conditions in the country, it is natural that people are looking for work and study opportunities in a country where the community and many of the family are already ahead,” said Kristin Rammus, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians granted temporary residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in the last ten years the number of temporary residence permits issued to the latter has increased.
When Ukrainians come here to work, Russian citizens come here for family migration.
“Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the largest family ties to people living in Russia,” said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences.
"If we look at where Russian citizens who have been granted an Estonian residence permit have moved to, Ida-Viru County is immediately behind Harju County," he added, pointing out that about 40 percent of them have married a European Union citizen.
Last year, 1,696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to extend their residence permit decreased.
"The jump is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit for settling permanently in Estonia has been applied for," said Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, according to whom Russian citizens' interest in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for settling permanently in Estonia from last year.
Its purpose is to encourage adapted people to stay here.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has also been reduced.
Last year, for example, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Ukrainians can now switch jobs and the Estonian state no longer keeps a finger on whether the salary criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular – the applicants last year were holders of grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people were granted residence permits to settle in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1,269.
Surprisingly, in ten years Nigeria has become one of the most active Estonian residence permit applicants.
In 2007, the number of residence permits issued to Nigerians was 200.
They come from Nigeria to study here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Nigerian citizens has risen mainly due to study migration.
They are also subject to the rule that where a community has arisen, it is easier for others to emerge,” Rammus added.
In the last ten years, two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, that is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if we include the citizens of the European Union, migration will remain at about a percentage", Maasing commented, in fact, the figures are small.
According to Statistics Estonia, a total of 14,822 people migrated to Estonia last year, while 13,792 emigrated from Estonia.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year.
Most of those who move out and move in are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those who leave.
Therefore, the net migration of Estonian citizens was down by 2,000 people last year.
Estonians travel primarily between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's Princess Fashion Fascinates with Sats, Embroidery and Tulle
For Maria Tammeoru, however, the bottomless Ark of Ideas is history – old paintings and costumes: “I can dream in a museum for hours and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, you will study and learn more about it every day.
It is the joy of discovery!
Mammu Couture's glamorous world may seem unreal to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much light you have in your life.
I have a friend who has a sauna full of haute couture dresses.
Because it’s not his fault that he doesn’t live in Hollywood and don’t go to the red carpet every day, he wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and that’s it!
You can make your life special.
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everyday life.
It was this thought that made the plan to take high fashion in Estonia to rural areas, between forests and fields, to people who are often not reached by fashion.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion alleys, where 45 models of royal deli filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, they often take a pose, nod with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions – they shout bravo, get up, want to thank you by the hand.
A lot of the audience just came to check it out, but now they're Mammu Couture fans.
If you exceed people's expectations, they'll be thrilled!
And I like the feeling of being on a summer tour with my fashion creations.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre-long red carpet, the whole street was full of beautiful dresses, it seemed that they would never end!
Maria also doesn’t admit to fashion that the creation has to be presented by a super-sale supermodel, she likes to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they have always come with pleasure.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I’m so sorry that I’ve never seen my own show, because I’m always backstage to give things a last touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves wouldn't let me sit quietly in the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn’t just want to play the role of a presenter, she wants to be involved in everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, I do most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I’m never far from my job and I’m not afraid of it.
Design is not just about styling, logistics, organizing, organizing – everything has to fit into the day of a temperamental woman.
The workload is huge for fanatics.
I can’t tell you when my day is going to end, it’s just a joyous day for me!
I’m still very lucky – it’s like a chain of unceasing happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and compliments in turn.
Many times it has been said that there is magic in my dresses - they make me feel like a princess.
The lavish tulle satsires that made Maria’s talent famous overnight have remained Mammu Couture’s signature to this day.
Martin Müürsepp from U18 boys: Estonians’ group tournament weapon was turned against us
I'm sorry, the fairy tale's over.
The first thing we noticed was that we couldn’t get to our table.
And if there’s such a big difference in the table, there’s nothing to do,” said Martin Müürsepp, the only basketball player to have played in the NBA.
The opponents took 28 balls from the offensive table and received so many more attacks as a result.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it created .
Many of the British attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build a defense.
In the defense, however, they were able to hold hands everywhere, we could not combine.
It kicked the team's feet off.
The housework was better done.
In Müürsepp’s opinion, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to slow down the opponents’ momentum in the bud.
In the last quarter - we had zero fouls, but the opponents already got several quick baskets.
The athleticism and the intense push that was our weapon in the group stage now turned against us all.
Today we had no power against their aggressiveness.
The mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tassi.
In general, good words can be said about the whole team, up to today there was a uniform punch.
It is a pity that you have not met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been self-confident and still played its part today, but it seemed that it was tired - it has carried quite a load.
But he made some really nice moves that I’ve seen in practice before,” added the instructor.
The women’s basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters of the tournament.
In the U18 age group, the boys’ B-division basketball tournament is not only in Tallinn, the girls started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
Unfortunately, Estonia’s game with Poland was in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but still after the third quarter it was 9:49, i.e. only in the last ten minutes the opponents took their foot off the gas pedal and that period was tied at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarter, Estonia scored 4, in third with 1 point...
The Estonians hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, then 25 missed the game, then one in three and then another 21...
In less than half an hour, 47 shots were fired.
In addition, 2 points came from 4 free throws.
The number of ball losses was a reasonable number at that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had a 33 per cent and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two defeats, on the opening day Portugal had to concede 83-56 superiority.
NATO ships come to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent mine countermeasures group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit to supplement the ships’ supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships make preparations to return to the sea and give the crew members the opportunity to rest for a couple of days.
After the visit, the NATO vessels will stay in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be ready for future operations in search of historical explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the cooperation training they provide in local waters illustrates our integration with the allied forces," said Commander of the Operations and Planning Department, Commander Arto Reinmaa, who is responsible for the Navy's fleet.
As of 29 June, NATO’s 1st permanent mine-control group is led by Latvian Marine Lieutenant Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of the group commander from Estonian Marine Officer Lieutenant Johan-Elias Seljamaa at a ceremony in Riga.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsatis, which also operates the group’s flagship.
During this half-year, the international unit also includes the Estonian Navy minehunter Sakala.
As one of the four groups of ships under NATO naval command, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Action Group is a readiness unit of the primary rapid reaction force, which the alliance can deploy to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, initiated by maestro Eri Klas 13 years ago, will be held.
According to Risto Joost, Artistic Director of the Tallinn Philharmonic Society (36), this year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The audience will see the opera world classics "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet productions from the enchanting Bolero to the amusing "Karlsson", and also a self-production of the programme, this time a production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio "Seasons" by the same international creative team that in 2015 brought to Pirita Haydn's second masterpiece "Creation".
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It is bigger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival that's fascination takes over and never lets go.
For the experience which the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human soul ring and touches the human senses in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the maestro Eri Klas's shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been very helpful.
He guided me throughout my student career and also supported me at the beginning of my directing career.
Perhaps this will make it easier for me to continue my work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it all carries over to me.
It was great to join a team that knows how things work.
It was the great heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to continue with the Birgitta Festival at the Tallinn Philharmonic Society.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What can you tell the audience at this year’s festival that you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, surprisingly, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren will be performed.
It's "Karlsson flies."
And one curious nuance about it is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this piece.
He has probably had the character of Karlsson since he was a child.
Risto, how do you manage all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and I am fortunate to have a lot of that.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as on me, i.e. how I meet each new day.
And keeping that kind of conscious tone, keeping that positivity, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning significantly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially this week, when it comes to the most important tests, I’ve been practicing it with a particular eagerness and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and increases tone.
It's not just a buzzword.
I don’t think people know half the stuff about their bodies that the universe offers them, but everyone is slowly discovering it.
Now, here's the big time.
Do you have any rituals before you step on the conductor's remote?
You have to change your clothes for more comfortable ones.
This is a small moment for myself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before the big show or take a little nap.
In fact, I like to communicate actively with people, even before stepping on a conductor’s pole.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here’s what to discover for a not-so-great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch a video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for asylum seekers in Sweden published
In Sweden, a test was carried out to assess the age of asylum seekers using a novel medical approach. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of those tested were older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinealverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were created to assess the age of asylum seekers more accurately after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly underage refugees.
To date, 6,880 cases have been sent for testing by Migrationsverket, and between mid-March and 31 July 2017, the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2,481 test results.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated 18 or older, and in another 25 cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the testee "could be 18 or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was "presumably younger than 18".
The tests are only used if the person's age is in question.
Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, said that the results were consistent compared to previous months.
"We don't see much difference from previous months' statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were rated as over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute issued 581 test results in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person being studied is 18 years of age or older".
But when the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper looked at the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical method of age assessment, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of the knee joints, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose job involves assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I've had good reason to think about it and I don't think the measurement method we're currently using should be used.
Determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally speaking, the risk of inaccurately categorizing a child into adulthood is low.
The risk is highest at around 10% if the person is just under 18.

Twenty-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London World Cup, taking a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female hammer thrower at the World Cup, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
On the first attempt (64.80) I immediately scored my average, on the second (62.80) I risked too much and on the third (67.37) I managed to keep my head clear", said Orel after the race.
I was looking for my discharge, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel’s debut ended in a good 18th place.
The rain did not interfere with Orel, because he is training at TUT Stadium throughout the winter.
"I'm tempered," he said with a small smirk.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house full of people, did Orel perceive people around him or was he able to turn himself off?
I did, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it's going to add up - that's it!
If you are competing, you will experience it.
Orel confirmed that he would be satisfied with his World Cup debut and that he still has a lot of good competitions to look forward to: “I came here with the 32nd result of this season, i.e. the last result, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I’m 20 years old and that’s all that matters.
I have a great experience and some days I want to compete for medals.
Governor of West Virginia announces change of political party
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night that he would switch parties with President Trump.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me,” Justice said.
"Today I say to you, after much prayer and thought... today I say to you, the Western Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
There were cheers at the gathering.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
“As a coach, I think it’s time to play a different game.
Trump had previously promised a major announcement at a gathering in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
Its value is approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an announcement Thursday night that "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from getting better again than working towards it".
“Just 15 governorships and control of the lowest number of states in history – Governor Justice’s announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is “end-to-end” and cannot find a positive, unifying message,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.
Not surprisingly, where there are many people, there are also many injured.
Urmet, who works in the medical tent at the weekend, told Õhtuleht yesterday that the patches have had to be distributed quite a lot.
Blisters and abrasions are basic, with outstretches and slight falls.
Head, back and leg pains, of course.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes, and so the problems come.
The medics have also had to help a couple of visitors with major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or a finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, the bigger ones we'll send to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the celebrants ask for a painkiller to treat a hangover.
Coe praised the Russians' honest apology for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, head of athletics, said he praised Russia's "fair apologies for Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country to return to sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the head of Russian athletics, said at the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that the ban on competition imposed on his country is correct and he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who have been stripped of their gold and silver medals in the competition".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban on state-sponsored doping imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and Congress were pleased that the Russian federation admitted that they have had some rather difficult times and that they are doing everything possible to reorganise the federation."
In Coe’s words, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that now is not the time for Russia's withdrawal," Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF’s strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet several criteria for reinstatement.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping control was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will dramatically change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution change everything from fuel to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that they will win in one place and lose in another, smaller mining companies won’t be helped.
Glencore currently earns from coal and oil, but there will be increasing demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel in the age of electric cars.
This year, the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway have stepped up their efforts to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
As a result, Volvo has announced that it plans to abandon its internal combustion engine and Tesla will launch a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, electric cars are expected to sell more in two decades than oil-fuelled cars.
"For some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranini, a raw material analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a huge impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has been growing for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore reported.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that this will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from rising electric car prices and being the world’s largest cobalt producer, according to Jefferies Group.
According to this brokerage firm, the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to the changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Exchange has seen a cobalt appreciation of 70 percent.
The price increase was 37%.
The price of copper has also risen 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Shares of Glencore rose 20 percent in London after surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side, there are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine that need to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is batteries that supply power to starters in petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless other uses are found that could overcome the decline in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of metal market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effect of the unfolding trend is yet to be seen in the price movement of lead.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, making it the best metal among the top industrial metals in London.
Investors see problems with metal only in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's that bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at Triland Metals, a metal brokerage firm.
When the demand for lead drops, it occurs slowly.
This may happen in about 10 years.
In the meantime, stricter emission standards mean that demand for hybrid cars will increase, depending on lead-based batteries that are developed during frequent engine launches, according to an international lead and zinc research organization.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel because a lighter car can travel farther with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tonnes of alumina demand already in 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the world’s aluminium production.
This trend is likely to intensify, Widmer said.
The price of aluminium has risen 13 percent this year, as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce lightweight car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also working to develop a lighter alloy steel to resist aluminum.
"High-strength steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
There has been some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was used as catalysts for diesel-powered cars, said Johnson Matthey, a metal refiner.
"Many of the raw materials currently in high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not have much demand in the future," said Bernard Dahl, a raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe there will be continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, CEO of Uncore, said more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 than fully electric cars.
The platinum industry’s big hope for the next 10 years is that Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos will develop hydrogen-based cars that rely on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not been commercially proven.
"Diesel seems to have a clear loser on the road to electric cars," Exane told BNP Paribas of Brunet.
German automakers suffered a backlash in July after a court in Stuttgart banned diesel from Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football finance rules will affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules, designed to prevent European football clubs from spending unbridled, do not prevent Neymar from making a world-record transition from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences for UEFA, the governing body that rules the European game and has the power to prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still to come.
The UEFA Financial Rules for Fair Play (FFP), introduced in 2011, mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar’s transfer was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract alone, and Neymar’s salary is set to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to raise such money to recruit Neymar and add to its star formation, given that the team is funded by the Qatari energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot to recruit players, but they have to balance it with legal income sources that allow them to come out with their own in the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that would fall into great debt in search of success would actually engage in cheating and risk ruin if banks or owners had to give up support.
As of 2011, the FFP focuses on tracking the losses of clubs instead of debt.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 at Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then make big spending to improve the team and create a global brand - will be more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of the FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to €30 million.
And despite Platini’s disgraced rejection of the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead, and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said Andrea Traverso, an FFP supervisor at UEFA.
Although PSG paid Neymar for the buy-over clause in a single payment, it is possible for them to break that amount down for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so it is possible to show the transitional fee over the next five years as an annual amount of EUR 44.4 million.
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, suffered the most severe penalties.
PSG was fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to outsmart regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies associated with club owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to count as official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG support was poached.
It has been said that some of Neymar's PSG service may come through payments from the 2022 World Cup Management Committee from Qatar.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the Neymar transition with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of ensuring their anonymity as they were not allowed to discuss the situation with PSG.
The latest published reports show that PSG made more than €10 million in profits in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of around €542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30 per cent in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, sought to prevent Neymar's transition, claiming that PSG was thereby violating the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the PSG as being primarily owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance on state funding for the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape over the past 15 years," Wenger said.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as a country may have other ways or other interests for such a large player to represent the country."

50 years ago today: a hurricane storm in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane, which was called the storm of the century and raged on 6 and 7 August, caused great damage primarily to Läänemaa, Harju County and Rapla County.
In North-West Estonia, the wind speed during those days was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one arching tree in the garden to another and tried to support them with his hands.
It was all dark and crackling, like the end of the world.
Roofs were already flying from the houses, recalled old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu in 2002 in an interview with Eesti Loodus magazine.
Linda's husband saw the garden he planted fall apart.
But why do you keep supporting trees with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, the water splashed in from the windows,” said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
Linda saw that the roads were full of trees and that the roof of the railway station platform had flown 20-30 metres away, like most of the people in Haapsalu, only the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in the ground, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm passed through beautiful old trees like a war.
Lääne-Viru County was not particularly badly damaged in the August storm of 1967 compared to Lääne-Eesti, but the losses were also great there, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped off the face of the earth, but the parks in our area were also severely damaged.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
On August 6, a little girl in Merivälja, Tallinn, cried out: "Mom, Mom!
Chickens are in the air and can’t get down!” wrote Virumaa Teataja.
The Põlli Manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm to such an extent that it was decided to demolish it later.
The constructions of Türi ski jumping hill, which were not restored later, did not survive the August Storm.
On August 12, 1967, the newspaper Red Star reported that the harvesting of towns and settlements from fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and that residents could participate in the clean-up work.
Crop fields were also badly damaged in the storm, and the newspaper reported that "the party's primary organizations must be the inspiration and direction for both the clean-up and the harvesting."
Hurricanes can be said to occur when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The wind speed record in Estonia is from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu measured the wind speed at 48 m/s.
The measuring instrument broke on Vaindloo Island, so the measured strong wind speed could not be recorded accurately.
The secret of clean beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Colder summer weather also means less cleaning effort on the beaches of Tallinn.
“If there is no water, there are people on the beach, and if there are no people, there are no people on the beach.”
Seagulls cry out at the North Tallinn Stroomi beach.
For them, the melodic competition lies with the low-speed tractor, which plows the stripes on the beam.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand from a depth of seven centimetres, picking up marine debris and debris left behind by humans: bottle caps, cigarette butts, and more.
People come to the beach whether the water is hot or not.
If the weather is nice, then there are people on the beach, and if there are no people, then there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, the manager of the cleaning works of the private limited company Haabersti Haldus.
It’s 6:30 a.m. and the beach is busy, because at 8 p.m. the place has to be tidy for people.
Usov has been on duty since 4:00 p.m.
Besides Stroomi, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Pikakari beach in Paljasaare.
The amount of rubbish has decreased.
Years ago it was so much more.
People already know how to appreciate what is being done for them,” says Usov, who has been cleaning the beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new was installed, it was already broken the next day.
Now what's on the beach is being kept.
The price of clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea litter, i.e. seaweed, washed ashore.
For example, on Pirita beach, 400,000 tons have to be transported during the beach season.
"It's an incredible quantity", notes Usov.
The second big category is household waste, which is all that people leave behind.
Stroomi Beach has eight large garbage cans that need to be emptied three times a week.
There is so much rubbish.
However, the colder summer weather has meant that the amount of garbage is one-fifth less than it would otherwise be.
The third category consists of abandoned objects.
They're mostly babies.
This time, Usov has shoveled out a dozen model cars from the sand.
They are waiting for the owners on the beach.
"Usually more of them come out, but this is a normal catch." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
The children come to the beach and pick up the toys to drown them in the sand again.
Disperse the trash
Erika Scholler, a representative of Haabersti management services, admits that the locals are disturbed by the tractor’s screening.
The noise, which lasts from night to early morning, interferes with the sleep of people in the neighborhood.
During the day, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
However, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, the goal is to get Stroomi beach under the international blue flag quality label.
“Compared to Europe, Estonia has a lot more work to do to maintain the beaches,” Scholler says.
We've got more adru and rocks and harder sand to sift.
However, there is less garbage on our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
Upon hearing about the rubbish on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, casually enters the discussion group of the journalist and cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a nasty picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with the birds and bottle pickers who have been throwing trash bags inside out,” Martin reports.
Although it is difficult to assume that people will be able to change their behaviour, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the rubbish bins and put covers on them, for example, to prevent at least the birds from going there.
Overall, however, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroomi Beach.
You can see the city is taking care of it.
With children's playgrounds, illuminated and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
It was once the case that roller skates could only be driven on one road,” notes Martin.
Treasure hunter's finds in Stroomi: coins, only coins
A 40-year-old Dimitri has come to take advantage of the low tide, combing the beach with a metal detector as a treasure hunter.
He does not believe that he will find anything valuable today or in the future.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough to do so.
"I've been doing this for a year and I haven't found anything of value so far," says Dmitri.
As a hobbyist, Dmitri’s treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails that later throw into the trash.
Usually there are coins.
“There are no gold, rings or anything like that,” the treasure hunter says.
Bank of England to hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates at the same level as weak economic growth and a easing of inflation have dampened speculation over the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as tight household incomes put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers at the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep the 6:2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for an increase this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation is still expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signaled that an increase in rates would be necessary in the next few years to contain inflation caused by Brexit and that higher than expected increases in credit costs may be necessary in financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago for the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package to boost the economy launched as a result of Brexit.
The bank will close a term funding scheme in February that offers cheap funding to banks, though said it is now expecting a £15 billion increase in its bid of £115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) will remain weak in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
Regarding the rates, it was reiterated that a "some tightening of the monetary policy" is needed to alleviate inflation, and to a "somewhat larger" extent than expected in the markets.
The stock market is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all types of jumps are gradual and limited.
The bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to US$1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision not to make any changes has been driven by recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing expectations due to an increase in GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice to households suffering from rising inflation and poor wage growth, saying that the situation will get worse before it recovers.
It added that monetary policy cannot prevent an income shock in the next few years, but a significant recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also spurred by growing demand for British production, which partially compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were moved to 0.25% last August after a shocking EU referendum that caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, there was a sense of increasing demand to raise the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on distressed households; in July, three policymakers called for the rate to be raised to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it expected it to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excessive growth compared to the 2% target was entirely due to a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again as lenders yearn for work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock market looks particularly favorable to those whose current trades are beginning to close as refinancing, often without a service fee and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular."
NHS to prescribe HIV drugs to 10,000 people
Patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September, following a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that public health now makes available an estimated 10,000 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets during the initial three-year clinical trial, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after an appeals court upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency's own claims that the drug should instead be funded by local authorities.
NHS England executive Simon Stevens hailed the move as a "new large-scale intervention", while the National AIDS Foundation (NAT) described it as a "turning moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start enrolling people. More clinics will be added in October, before the programme is implemented everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medications taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Clinical trial results show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there is a sufficient amount of certain medicines in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day, or at least two hours before intercourse.
Candidates eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not receiving treatment.
Clinicians identify eligible people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people, and those whose HIV-positive partner is not on antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate at the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The program will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week following an international tender procedure.
The goal of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Stevens said, "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the large-scale and increasingly successful fight against HIV transmission.
This is yet another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of humanity's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said, "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at those who need it and belong to a high-risk group, offers the opportunity to change England's HIV epidemic.
Since September, people at high risk of HIV in England, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and independent of negotiation with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said, "The priority now is to make sure that the clinical trial is launched quickly across the country and that none of those at risk of HIV are left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been procured, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, the Public Health Shadow Minister, said, "The start of the clinical trial of PrEP is very welcome and well delayed after months of delays and dragging the government's legs.
The evidence shows how much this medicine can change the way HIV is prevented and this life-changing infection is stopped.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, while it decreased in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the next day’s exchange price of electricity between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the Lithuanian-Swedish connection failures.
The average exchange price of electricity in Estonia last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour and the price increased by 12% compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by 5% to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros, while the system price of the Nord Pool power exchange was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 percent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity flowed to Estonia for 75 percent of the hours of the previous month and to Finland for 16 percent of the hours.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place for the next day's transactions.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia 99 percent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 percent of the hours had the entire transmission capacity.
According to transactions on the last trading day of July, the electricity exchange price on the Nasdaq OMX market may be around 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the price of electricity production, increased last month and transactions were carried out at a price of 5.04-5.47 euros per ton.
Living at a height – half-floor and clever design tips have made this tiny Earls Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, traded her large Knightsbridge home for Earls Court's apartment in 2014.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and Joanne's failure to pack up her bags and resell the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
“Before that, I lived on much larger land with my ex-partner in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be the same price as what I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93 square meter apartment has undergone a complete overhaul.
At first, it was an apartment with a single bedroom and a complex layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from Duck & She, an architecture and design studio based in Notting Hill, to take advantage of the 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where one could stand upright.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"Metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were located on top of each other without having to bend over.
It wasn’t just about building a platform, we used a steel structure to make sure the height of both the upper and lower room was right.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms on top of each other in the room, with plenty of dramatic elements.
The half-story overlooks the glamorous living room below with its old copper-lighted Retrouvius window.
Gold furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and a retro-sounding Serge Mouille light accentuate the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and light.
Mirrors have been added at both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the rear wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening into another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers storage space for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The possibility to close the kitchen part when it is not in use adds to the charm of the living room, creating an image of a more glamorous space.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this kitchen, however, is that it is a garage-type retractable door.
"It took a bit of design work," Erfan explains with a steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
“It has a counterweight, so it glides very easily when you push it up.”
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor space is what you sell - or what gives value to the property," says Erfan.
“The real estate agent enters the room in an outdated form and performs calculations based on the floor area.”
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“Materials are the ones you touch that help you bond emotionally with your home,” says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with electrical cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the tongues of the heart ring."
This shows that a good design and an increased area will help to make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even make you want not to leave, like Joanne did.
Dane Jensen is a bounty hunter in a Chicago skyscraper competing for a promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money earned, along with any ethics.
He sees his wife and three children only in the early morning and late evening.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that this is the business version of House of Cards – even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler’s speech is similar.
The further the film goes, the less the frame-house element remains, and the filmmakers’ moralizing intent begins to stand out more and more.
A life-changing experience for the main character will be his son getting cancer.
A choice must be made between work and family.
An architect’s dreamy son makes his father think about the really important things in his walks to the big buildings in Chicago, such as faith, goodness, love, and not even the disaster of the Twin Towers.
After the third scene, when the son opens his father’s eyes, it feels that the filmmakers have set out to make sure that the audience will cry, because even the coldest-hearted viewer cannot hold back tears from seeing the suffering of the beloved cancer-stricken boy.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, the father finally understands the immorality of his job and does a good deed to the old man looking for work.
Now I’m betting on myself – if the movie has a happy ending, I’ll reward my insight after the movie with coffee, but if I’m wrong, the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, I suspect I’ll miss my coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he rushes slowly down the hall toward the ward.
Rather, the son is miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be a good thing, since now is the time to take care of the family.
I'm also very good at predicting the end of the American drama.
In truth, the film is well constructed, and all the necessary elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and morality is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I guess this movie brings it in really well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information reaching President Trump, including the news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in the water more level.
Here's an excerpt from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When White House chief of staff John F. Kelly first met with senior officials, he outlined a key issue President Donald Trump had in the White House that he intended to solve by getting bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that the information must flow through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if good information was given to him."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he’s in the White House, his TV habits haven’t disappeared.
"If candidate Trump was upset about the dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also covered fairly in affected publications," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico’s Tara Palmer wrote at the time that “according to six former campaigners, the key to managing Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption consistently includes praise.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habits have once been “controlled” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s tweets would have been even more inflammatory without their interference.
We’ll probably never know about tweets Trump didn’t post.
If his assistants managed to get him out of trouble even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, where there are competing clicks, people are trying to promote their own interests, without exception, by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote about the advisers’ tendency to present the president with strategically questionable information.
One example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, is as follows:
“Current and former Trump employees are saying Trump may be reacting explosively to negative press reports, especially damaging ones, by becoming obsessed with identifying their source.
That’s what happened in late February when someone gloatedly handed the president a printed copy of an article on the website GotNews.com, owned by Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the “source of multiple leaks” at the White House.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter for taunting, or that he didn’t offer any concrete evidence, or that he has also made and retracted false accusations in the past.
Trump read the article and started asking subordinates about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, and Rob Porter, head of the White House office, "have been trying to put in place a system to manage and document the documents that reach Trump."
How'd you do that?
Kelly tries to do the exact same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad are not anxious to get permission to perform.
There are a lot of foreigners playing in the centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom Õhtuleht met admitted to playing in the Old Town without the permission of the city government.
We first found three street musicians near the Viru gates who had brought the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that the musicians with dreadlocks and torn clothes were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite appearances, the only woman in the company played a story with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while a man juggled with three balls next to her and called the passers-by closer.
The third man had sat next to them on a backpack and smoked a self-made joint in peace of mind.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Bob, who played the accordion and juggled the balls, said he was playing in the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the group’s presentation was to collect ticket money for the ship travelling to Finland on the evening of the same day.
When asked if they asked permission from the city to make music in the Old Town, Noem and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and for the most part, permits are issued for a month or so.
There’s no point in paying for it,” Bob said.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw two women staying with the musicians and driving them away.
The group moved to the Viru Centre intersection with backpacks and dogs to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other clarinet and the third had even brought along an electronic piano.
"We're here to entertain people, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living," the trio's pianist, Mivosh, explained.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the city government must have permission to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but we have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank bought 149 million euros worth of bonds as part of the public sector asset purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area in July, and the central bank’s bond portfolio grew to a total of 4.36 billion euros.
The central bank does not provide detailed information about the purchases.
The Governor of Eesti Pank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to the interpellation of the members of the Riigikogu that the asset purchase programme of the Eurosystem central banks includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds, ABS and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who sell bonds to invest elsewhere.
As a result of the purchases, the return on the lower-risk assets decreases and this motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, each central bank buys its own government bonds as part of a public bond purchase programme; bonds from other countries are not bought.
As the Estonian state has not issued any bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Substitution purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the supply of purchase programme bonds is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank has been purchasing bonds under the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
Meanwhile, Elering bonds were also acquired, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering bonds as of June 2016.
Starting from June, both Elering and Eesti Energia will acquire the bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
The travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again fiercely confronted by determined travelers who have defied a ditch dug by the council to reclaim a field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field near the wealthy "millionaires' district" christened Solihull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children, and trucks after they were kicked out of there only in May, without being disturbed by a trench dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the guardrail, squeezing their vehicles through an unobstructed section that had been left as a footpath.
The furious residents have scoffed at Solihull's council, saying that the council is "useless in dealing with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there Monday night after they were driven out of Bentley Heath, where they stoned passersby.
The council must be shamed into taking action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
There were more of them last night, probably even more today.”
He added, "Birmingham council knows how to handle this sort of thing by procuring long bars to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not satisfied that I have to continue to pay the council tax if the council can't even stop such a thing."
A local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said, "This is ridiculous, we just saw the last of these travelers leave, and there's already a new offensive.
This time the number has increased and the grass has even been seen rumbling about the horse."
A spokesman for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unauthorised campground on land near Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with the Solihull police. We are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful to have as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The weekend will be visited by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring real top names to the world.
When asked why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival to the fullest.
However, he admits that the real players have come to Pärnu.
“Looking at the level of the artists that have been brought to Estonia, they bring home the absolute top names of this genre of music – this often does not happen in our area,” the Minister of Culture said.
Which of the festival’s artists speaks for themselves the most?
I consider myself a relatively old person, and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who performed last night.
After all, all of us have been spinning on our own at some point,” he says.
However, he also mentions several other names, including Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, we also have our own Estonian makers: starting with NOËP and you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high," he says.

Audi renews up to 850,000 diesel vehicles amid criticism from automakers
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer a software upgrade for more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the BMW chairman, the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
None of the companies described these actions as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been keen to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrous oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to be installed for the automotive industry to neutralise the emissions of diesel vehicles will increase, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is also accused of spoiling powerful automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which silenced the use of so-called “fraud devices” that allowed the emissions readings to be adjusted to conform with regulations while testing the car, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics division of Audi’s engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zacchio Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany, when the authorities accused the Audit of installing a system to circumvent European emissions requirements, thereby expanding the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be a major blow to Volkswagen as a luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
20,000 euros worth of European Union flags will be purchased for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy EU flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
A total of 570 educational institutions will receive the flag of the European Union with the dimensions of 105x158 cm.
The flags are meant to be displayed indoors, they must be made in high-quality printing technique indoors also with a tunnel mount, the news portal of ERR reports.
The flagpole sign reads: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark Estonia's first presidency of the Council of the European Union.
According to the Ministry of Education, the estimated cost of the 570 flags is 20,000 euros, i.e. one flag will cost 35 euros.
Journalist's murder highlights growing danger in Mexico
Workers from the weekly Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans for the most recent chaos in Sinaloa, fueled by organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change your routine.
Two senior journalists are discussing which is safer: bringing the children to an office that was targeted by a grenade attack in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the front of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to name names in each column without the need for evidence, enough with impressions and gut feelings.
The government or cartels are suspected of employing drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on a list of villains who make reporting on the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in in in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been state-protected since the attacks and threats.
The most recent victims include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be felt everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building hanging from a large picture of Valdez showing his middle finger with the inscription "Justice" and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his characteristic Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss joint trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime, which number in the thousands, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the terrain is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and fairness of the murderers, the security meeting will not be of much use, according to Ibarra.
"It's very silly to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"As long as you don't know the reason, you distrust everybody."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and was shot 12 times. This is presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates to "Twelfth River".
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed nearby with it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is only silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions struggle to fill a power vacuum.
It does not matter that a person or several are shot every day on Sinaloa streets, or that the cemetery is overflowing with ornate double-glazed mausoleums of drug lords, larger than the homes of many living people.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to the fact that there is only one cartel operating in a seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all of this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers involved in his work, Riodoce co-founder and manager Ismail Bojorquez, 60, feels tremendous remorse for his failure to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two errors.
The first was the release in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of the click-on cartel, which competes with Guzman’s sons and is at war.
The letter may have angered the sons, and the suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived at the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid on another newspaper covering the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003, when he teamed up with five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 worth of shares.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa "it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem".
Over time, the newspaper gained a reputation for its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by the print from which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow Mexican drug history wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said, accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to accept the task that comes with being a journalist and the other option is to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who snarled like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar across the road and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his love of routine was fatal to him.
His death has also made them doubt how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you messing with their wives, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is intense self-censorship and self-preservation, even in the best of times.
Trust your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be fooled... and that's what happened to Javier".
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt public officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce workers were meeting for security training, cell phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that spyware sold only to governments had been used in Mexico to track journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the government to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered, half jokingly, if these officers were among the 50 percent of the officers the governor himself has branded as untrustworthy.
It's been months since reporters have traveled to mountainous areas where drug gangs have de facto control.
This week's edition of Riodoce dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government funds on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows the restaurant is a favorite for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered to a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire last century.
More recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption within the framework of widely publicized lawsuits.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents in the same location, including how Guzman's son, known as El Chapo, escaped military service.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column for information on the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what happened earlier," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose cleenical build has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has become a storage space for signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff has become something they never expected activists to do in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of tags and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration over another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after Valdez was killed.
The body has been found burned and officials say it belongs to him, according to DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and are scribbling the phrase "SOS press" on sidewalks and buildings as an organized protest.
On this day, President Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Afterward, he asked to be redirected from reporting on the government's actions, worrying that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "captured" by organized crime, complicit state officials, and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces who are in league with organized crime.
Media monitoring group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and state officials last year.
"In Mexico, you're going to die because they want you to be silenced," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously blood-curdling.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamaulipas, a northern border state, six years ago.
His body was found along with a letter probably signed by the cartel Los Zetas: "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to shoot as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their manager in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly to the drug cartel with an editorial on the front cover entitled "What Do You Want From Us?".
Some journalists have fled home states or even the country.
This is a nerve-wracking decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still have to look at the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as is probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in a Mexican apartment in 2015 three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and keep working must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that she is intimidated by the coverage of the drug trade.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number was already locked, Riodoce’s editors were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office sipping beer as everyone’s phones began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were reported dead in clashes between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by the many messages left behind by the cartels found in the area.
From the very edge of the sidewalk, reporters posted the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The next day, the front cover needed to be changed.
The sirens roared past yet another gunfight in the area.
Bojorquez peeked at the police officers on duty to see if they were alert.
If they were, at least they didn’t show it.
Under the massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, on which his middle finger is visible throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff delivered his footsteps.
"How could one think about closing at all," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets to make a report?"
Dinosaurs used protective paint to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although quite scary.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered by its scales was reddish-brown in color, and its past had been somewhat "difficult".
A report published in Current Biology described the creature as "the best preserved armoured dinosaur ever found" and "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its unbelievably good preservation overwhelmed researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable".
This armored vegetarian is the best-preserved type of fossil ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he excavated at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The next six years were spent digging the animal out of a 2,500-pound (1,100-pound) piece of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be made public.
"If you squint a little, you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivore, though covered in scales and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely significantly threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This armored dinosaur used red and white as protective colors to hide from predators and employed a form of shading known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many animals today.
According to experts, this allowed the dinosaur to better blend into its surroundings and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely hunting for it.
This 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurus family first appeared on the news in May and is now on a visit to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory technician at the Borelopelta Markmitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal.
Due to the amazingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered a counter-shelter, a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although counter-sunk is common, the findings come as a surprise, as the Borelopelta are much larger than the animals that survive counter-sunk today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was being actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to shadow instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
However, most modern animals using counter-espionage – such as deer, zebras, or armadillos – are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurs had to really struggle to survive.
"The intense hunt for a huge, armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period could be," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of armored organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its gut, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, thus reaching the sea with the current, where it sank in front of its back to the ocean floor.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as today's South Florida, and rivers and oceans likely extended much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, while remaining three-dimensional, preserving its original shape," Brown said.
As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as it did in the Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it – you just have to squint your eyes and it feels like you’re sleeping.”
The Cretaceous Period was a time when huge two-legged carnivorous dinosaurs roamed the Earth - theropods.
Although their all king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borelopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its fearsome predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) tall and six-ton-weight monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borelopelta washed into the sea after death, and it mummified in mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he excavated at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including the skin and scales, and is a complete muzzle to the hips.
These creatures averaged 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Its shoulders were pierced by two 20-inch spikes.
Scientists believe that this armor-covered herbivore ventured through present-day Western Canada until a flooded river washed into its open sea.
But the dinosaur’s undersea burial ground helped to preserve its scales in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur skulls still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "This degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy scales on the animal’s skull.
The right forefoot rests beside him, and the five toes are extended upward.
I can count the scales on his soles."
How did an activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell suffered a complete shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York City, this St. Louis resident sat on a bed in a rented room via Airbnb while browsing Facebook on his phone.
He came across a post from a former schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The @TheePharoah user’s posts were repeatedly shared in his timeline.
The St. Louis rapper posted a live tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later that evening saw another tweet announcing the gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos of the police tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and held up a sign saying "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!" were shared.
He watched a live stream where a police officer stood with a barking dog in front of a group of protesters.
In the second video, another police officer, according to him, cocked a rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "That's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we might call typical."
I was terrified at that moment.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he went to his father to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive to Ferguson by themselves the next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary, Whose Streets?, which will premiere in cinemas on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and tenacity from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter - wearing a flowered dress and wearing a matching crown - drove up to Ferguson, they again talked about what they had talked about several times before that morning - the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't not take him with me," Ferrell later said.
"What is happening now is the culmination of what has happened in the past.
He must know it, and see it, and grow in its midst.
He must learn about activism and organization, as well as about the different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we must do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her without personally experiencing blatant racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road, a place across the street from the police station that had become a kind of camp where activists were waiting for news of police officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who was preparing lunches.
They put food bags together and helped distribute them to protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism was slowly beginning to take shape.
"My activism completely changed after August 9th," he said, noting that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was president of the Association of Minority Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any organizing experience.
It all just worked out."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, co-director of one of the films, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrell asked, “Are you trying to document what’s going on, or are you trying to find a story that can be exploited?”
This kind of skepticism was the result of countless cases of people - often white - coming into the community and trying to take advantage of its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for activism regarding death row inmates.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrell and six other locals who were watched for years by the crew of the film "Whose Streets?" after Brown's shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm portrayed."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement was not about a "redemptive leader, but about a community reunion", as Folayan put it - he became the film's most open participant.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished film.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanising black people has to come with a certain vulnerability."
Furthermore, Ferrell's story emphasizes and re-emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three startups who thought up the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in the wake of the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin on social media are homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership roles have maintained the movement overall," Ferrell said, " precisely because we have to fight on multiple fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women have to carry all that burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed being kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women".
However, he claims that "it's not about some kind of equal opportunity thing" - Ferrell wasn't chosen as the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was the person who gave the right energy," he said.
"But it's no coincidence that she was right on the front lines, because there's a lot at stake as a black gay woman living in nodes like this.
His energy can be sensed through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police remain fragile.
Ferrell faces a 2.5-year suspended sentence for blocking the road during the demonstration.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home simply as a "huge threat".
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has etched in his memory ever since he took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
7 Ways to Overcome a Hangover After a Weekend Party
Some of the toughest sons of men find after a party full of drinks what helps.
Or they say, "avoid a hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a proper cut to your health.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning and get over your hangover as painlessly as possible?
Drink water.
Under and after alcohol, after a big party in the morning... or possibly even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluids when consuming alcohol, it must be recovered somehow.
Along with water, minerals are also washed out of the body, so it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after a drink, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
You shouldn’t go to Grandma’s house for a hangover – it could be a fatal mistake.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Lying in a tent and getting a hangover is a more time-consuming way to get well.
Give your body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you are already sick from yesterday’s binge, you should definitely not try to load a large fat fry into your stomach.
For example, start with fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars that gently nourish your body.
If you are already feeling ill at lunchtime, you might want to try a broth.
And a little later on the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will rid your body of every last drop of water.
Like I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will lose performance.
You'll ruin your liver even more, and the hangovers will be worse in the future.
In addition, the painkiller does not stay in the body for very long.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don’t do it on an empty stomach – it irritates your already-healed stomach.
If you don’t have a partner, get on well with yourself.
It’s like walking, but you can’t have an orgasm.
However, avoid too active a pace and crazy poses - during a hangover, physical exertion should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Talk stupidly with your friends and fellow sufferers, do simple stupid things, and laugh at yourself and others (suffering) in a friendly way.
Jokes and laughter may not make a hangover go away, but they certainly make it more fun to tolerate aftereffects.
It’s going to be a hangover anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University staffer wanted for murder
Police say they are searching nationwide for a professor and Oxford University staff member who have become suspects after the body of a man with fatal stab wounds was found in a Chicago luxury apartment.
According to Cook County court documents, arrest warrants were issued on Monday for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being stabbed repeatedly.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police received a phone call and found a victim with multiple stab wounds on her body when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and investigators regard the stabbing as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects.
Lathem has been working as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the university, said in an emailed statement that Lathem had now been suspended from work and was barred from entering Northwestern University's campuses.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by competent authorities, and Northwestern University is working with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Assistant in the Financial Department at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with police in the UK and are ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies in any way we can."
In addition, the statement said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chicago Police Department communications director Anthony Guglielmi urges suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we're working more and more intensively to determine the exact location," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment number 1008.
Police said it was a hideous sight.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren were inside the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi added.
The management of Grand Plaza sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on chronology of events and identifying the victim's background, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family dispute."
Start-ups to help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the polls were unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse yet, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"The system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs the 75-member San Francisco-based e-commerce company Madison Reed.
So he called for outside help.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with the specific goal of measuring employee engagement, they enable companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hotline to complain, and in some cases, allow language carriers to bypass C-level managers and contact the board directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where's Fitbit for your business?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Errett, in the three years he has been using Glint, he has gained a much better insight into what his employees think and feel.
In addition to surveys and surveys aimed at specific teams, it also offers a company heat map that gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to find out the reasons.
Businesses have come to realize they need to keep abreast of their work culture so as not to become the next Uber that has been engulfed in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a harrowing environment that penalized those who dared to speak out.
For startups like Glint, having an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let’s Talk Payments, global governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Denver-based Convercent, a start-up based in Colorado that helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity this year amid Uber’s dubious reputation.
Convertent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send custom impulse surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go straight to the board.
"Public opinion has usurped the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if the company is found to be treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee resignations and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide an easy way to interact with corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the corporate headquarters' phone number or email address, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay practices that did not reach managers who were operating in offices in other cities or states can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
“I’m able to get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Team.
"And we will protect our shareholders from lawsuits with employees."
Quinlan said the companies began taking ethical behavior, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
However, it wasn't until "social media became mature" that companies realized they couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from washing publicly online.
"Before using technology to track ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a periodic fee for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both start-ups.
In February, Convertent received $10 million in funding from Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glinti invested $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments come as no surprise, given the interdependence between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies are showing that today’s employees expect more from the workplace than they did in the past.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, feel listened to, and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the company's success," said Nina McQueen, vice president of the Department of General Benefit and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder they find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to experts in work culture.
However, this data is useless if the company’s supervisors don’t do anything with it.
In fact, asking your employees for feedback can create expectations of change.
And if the changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, it can lead to frustration and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask 4000, you have to be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a consulting and business management firm who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things don't work out, the employees will think, 'Did you actually hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why should I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among employees, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from frustrated employees about the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesday, on the other hand, collects new employee data and is expected to lead to a longer-term commitment of employees in an industry known for its high workforce turnover.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
“When you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses."
The euro area’s brightest star is the Baltics: incomes are growing fast
Although the crisis of 2008 and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of rich countries in Western Europe, Bloomberg writes referring to a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999, the GDP per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
The success is due to low debt, rapidly improving institutions and business and free-market friendly policies.
“The Baltic states, along with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita in purchasing power has approached the EU average significantly,” the central bank said in a statement.
Although the goal is to equalize the gross domestic product per capita of the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the gross domestic product per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led Baltics to seek better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the locals are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the most recent Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents estimated that their economies are doing very well, or rather doing well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed thought so about the economies of their countries.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel training twice a day makes the Bruins’ days long
It’s almost 11 p.m. when a team of UCLA football players stops to chat on the edge of a new practice field on the team’s campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, revealing a sweaty back from the first day of their training camp.
For much of the team, these idle minutes provide a midday break.
After three hours of training, players will return to the dormitory to take their final exams before returning to Wasserman Soccer Center for meetings at 6.30 a.m. the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel training sessions twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer – at least until they finish their final exams on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three training sessions were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the players' already tight schedule.
The transition from two workouts a day means more days with one workout - the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of last season, and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, training sessions will take place during summer courses.
They have 18 training sessions scheduled until August 20 before the official preparations for the opening game against Texas A&M in September begin.
Mora says he is in favor of an NCAA rule change, though it adds another agenda item to the players' tight schedules.
"They're going to have a huge burden on three or four days, and that's a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they will break through this ordeal; they will make an effort, they will be nice young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's going to be really nice."
When the camp is over, UCLA will make the trainings closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of their fields from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been hit by footballs bypassing the defensive grid surrounding the gate post.
As of this weekend, Bruins players will occupy the hotel, but Mora admitted that there could be problems with the vacant rooms during the season.
"We will implement security measures," Mora said.
“This is a real concern and it’s not an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have a record of your training, it could be a pretty good deal.
But we'll use the security team there and the 8th parking lot.
We do our best by using what we have.
I try not to worry too much about that.
We have a plan in place."
Savisaar-Ivanova election coalition born to the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland who was expelled from the Reform Party and Maria Kaljuste who was forced to leave the EKRE to join forces, and Tegus Tallinn, a business people’s election coalition hoping to show a place for party members - it seems that the election coalitions created on the initiative of those who have been burned in party politics will participate in local elections at least as much as political parties.
However, they will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who will stay with Savisaar?
If the support of Edgar Savisaar has decreased to a small extent, one can guess from the events organised in honour of his election coalition.
A member of the Riigikogu, some former and current members of the Centre Party and many unknown faces – will this be the composition of the election coalition?
And can the reason why some of Savisaar’s loyal supporters and friends are avoiding the candidacy in Tallinn be searched for in the fact that the list of supporters of Savisaar, which is headed by corrupt people and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the city government for a Russian-language pop song in which an elder from Lasnamäe district participates; and a primitive computer game in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, has to avoid puddles and squirrels that get on the road when riding a bike – is this how the Centre Party first tries to get the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed to go to the ballot boxes?
We look forward to seeing what other parties have in mind when it comes to the youth campaign.
If the viewers of Kanal 2 or TV3 watch the black square instead of the entertainment show from the beginning of August, then there are two options: accept that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will be seen on free-to-air television in the future, or donate a tenth of every month to some television operator.
There are probably also those who at first openly rejoice in the ad-free TV experience, but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for the TV picture and the ads.
Ear-locking music, noisy crowds and rubbish left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to have fun yourself, it’s better to go home and discover your homeland instead of having a headache – and leave your sleeping place to the festival guests for a hefty sum.
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
President Donald Trump has said there is a new U.S. immigration plan that will change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in two chambers of Congress.
"This bill will cut poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and begin replacing the current program.
“The new application process will give priority to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Siberian Seto youths move to the city, pensioners return to the countryside.
Yevseyev's Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners of the ancient river Maana.
He works as a gold-car driver on the Kuvai, a tributary of the Maana River, 140 kilometres from home.
It’s hard work: 12 hours of work for two months at a time, with no rest days, and then only 10 days at home and back again.
During his three years at Artelli, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
“There’s a hard rule: you go in and have a thorough check so you don’t bring any vodka, and go out so you don’t take any gold,” Anatoly says.
Mare Piho talks to local Seto Jaan in Haida village, who has told her a lot about her family’s memories in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of the Setos in Siberia is also beginning to affect the domestic Setos, because it is just so fabulous, Piho Mare, who has studied distant Setos in the most thorough way, thinks.
His first trip to Siberia this year will be 30 years.
He has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many Setus emigrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to gain land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I'm saying 8,000.
I counted it out from the stories of Siberian Seto men who have thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say precisely, because at that time up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was issued to one person only, but there were children, sisters and other female relatives with him.
Look how big this area was!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomaa.
It had to be managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas that were not only connected with agriculture, but also with the river (farming), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petersburg, many Setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (there the Soviet power built a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in the area at that time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
There was also a long tradition of marriage and parenthood.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much did the Seto culture in Siberia differ and differ from that of the motherland Setos?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of clothes.
They made their own clothes, but they always made a distinction between what was brought and what was done here.
The traditional clothing of Setos was heavily influenced by climate change, as it is colder here.
The food changed.
For example, in Setomaa, meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the Seto villages in Siberia and what kind of life are they living there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, it is going to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to visit Haida at the beginning of July for the day of the Seto kingdom and lived in their homes for four days - J.P.
What's left here is amazing.
“It is very easy for Tapa to come and go, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the crossroads of the roads,” says Reigo Tamm, opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture, and pizza is available on every corner.
Kill is a top-heavy city!
There is a small island running through the town by the Valgejõgi river, where the slaughterers tend to have a Midsummer Eve party.
"You can't see this beautiful place from the train window," Reigo mutters.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, because the river is full of springs.
I’ve been swimming here, it’s okay.
You can have a picnic and just do romance – you can watch the river flow and think about life in front of you.
I've been there with my girlfriends.
Besides everything else, the opera soloist Tamm has gone to the river bank to practice his arias between the three bridges: "Because this place is on the outskirts of the city, no one will ever come back if I hum my stories".
"Männikumägi offers a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and play disc golf, for example - the golf course is done, the discs can be borrowed from the fitness centre," Reigo says.
The old pros, of course, go there with their discs, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
You should probably invite your colleague Rasmus Kull to Tapa because he is an experienced disc golfer and has discs.
I think he's lending it to me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears, disappointments and victories left on this mountain in my sporting life.
Not to mention the broken sleds and skis.
"The entire city centre is currently full of construction works, all of this is becoming unrecognizable," Reigo says.
The old and tired railway station building in Tapa is a very attractive place where summer performances are played.
I am glad that Märt Meos, the head of R.A.A.A.M., accepted my idea in 2012 and came to the station to do summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with Aleksei Karenin has just ended, on 11 August the railway station will have "Surviving" as the old station building is being moved around in the 1980s.
"August 11-13 are the days of the city of Tapa, during which there are also home cafes and a number of cultural events, including a folk rally," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the city at the age of 91.
In a small yellow cottage on May 1st, the museum has been open since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are lots of exhibits and lots of information", Reigo praises the place full of the history of the town of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and military.
Reigo smiles that if you go through all the recommended places in Tapa, you will get hungry in the long run, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
“We have such great places to eat and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you’re abroad,” he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, which is why sitting there gives you the strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international group all around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we move a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
BTV quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that two Bulgarians had been taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of people who had been camping illegally on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation going on.
The foreign ministry told bTV television that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone caught resting in a place not intended for that purpose.
Checks continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves who teach the cubs break the sheep.
After a year break, the farmers of Hiiumaa must once again give the wolves the “educational material” from their herd – wolves who have probably taught puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep three times in Hiiu county, with a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
The number was only three, down from 124 a year ago.
The data of the environmental agency that there were no wolf litters born in Hiiumaa last year and the information of the hunting council of Hiiumaa that two wolf litters have been fixed on the island this year are also in sync with the breaks.
On the night of Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna and injured 18 of the surviving sheep.
In the early morning of Wednesday, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of Reheselja village and severely injured another who had to be killed in an emergency.
Rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent the Bill on Amendments to the Release into Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the approval round.
With the amendment, the establishment of a separate database for the locations and handlers of genetically modified (GM) crops will be abandoned; in the future, the plant health register will be used for this purpose.
In addition, the obligation of a GM crop handler to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed radius will be amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not grown in Estonia at the moment, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-modified crops.
At least until the decision to declare Estonia GMO-free has been made,” said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sector," Suu added.
The Bill repeals the provisions relating to the database of locations and handlers of GM crops and the training in handling GM crops in the GMOVS, establishes the requirements for handling GM crops and commencement of economic activities.
Specific to beekeeping, the current obligation for GM crop growers to inform beekeepers about the start of GM crop cultivation will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting cultivation.
The Bill has been sent to the ministries for approval.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine it in the draft information system and, if they wish, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will affect in particular the persons operating in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop - MON 810 maize.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no corn pest in Estonia, the European corn borer, with respect to which the MON 810 maize line is resistant.
Also, varieties of this corn line have been bred for the southern regions, and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of different varieties of summer rape, maize and soy grown in Estonia.
Analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soy varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above, it can be concluded that genetically modified crops are not grown consciously in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of a "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a "genius" in Nemanja Matic's face after making his debut against midfielder Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40 million Chelsea buy-in started in Dublin United's final pre-season match before a 2–1 win against Real Madrid in the Uefa Super Cup on Tuesday, impressing in the defensive role while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on strike.
However, after being sidelined from the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was sorely short of the match form and only lasted 45 minutes, which Mourinho said must be fixed "firmly" before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but he has experience, he has intelligence, he has a brilliant mindset - he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
"We will help him get into shape as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the starting lineup at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began quietly setting up his eleven starting men by the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three more footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "great job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier when they can make four out of four, but they've worked really hard for me."
Another crane son received a GSM transmitter on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird-watcher living in Sõrve, the first stork cub to be equipped with a transmitter in Sõrve was born, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest site and joined the large nightingale collection of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because there is no grain field in Sõrve, writes the Voice of the Islands.
This Tuesday, already relatively late to ring the storks, another stork cub got attached to the transmitter, and this on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project, which is being carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork boy named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter in Sõrve, Türju.
"Everyone can see his activities on the Internet: how he went to winter in Spain, came back a long time ago to the German and Polish border and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
A British inventor has implanted a microchip in his body to gain access to his house and car.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could simply open his front door, get into the office, and even start a car.
Steven Northam, 33, has installed a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering this service via his BioTeq company to companies and individuals looking to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at Hampshire County Royal Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company will also replace the locks on houses and cars to make them compatible with the chip, charging £300 for one lock.
This married father of one has installed the technology in both his home and his car, the BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands.
According to military documents released to TIME magazine, the White House's decision to air a navy helicopter last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000 to pay for an event marking American production.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the president's onboarding, was the central attraction for the event, which took place at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials spent their tour looking at industrial products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-built helicopter was exhibited along with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War Office required the presence of a helicopter with a partial order, the FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said in an email to his commanding officer, the Navy's Deputy Chief of Staff, in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the southern yard at around 7 a.m. on July 17 and would remain there until the yard was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same evening.
Added to this was the fact that if leaving the White House were to be delayed, a second pick-up would be required for the return flight due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter at the time of the event, and squadron security personnel remained near the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to find out from the documents given to TIME magazine whether or not a second epic was needed in the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
Documents indicate that HMX-1 was investigating whether the event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told it didn't," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," replied the deputy commanding officer.
The White House declared the event an "American-made" official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts of the health care reform discussed at the event in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have to use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for photosessions is unusual.
Trump came to attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, featured a presidential plane, and his Twitter account was riddled with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display of 'America Made', featuring products from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often conduct test flights around Washington, D.C., and in the southern courtyard, to practice dropping off the President of the United States at the White House with an inch of accuracy.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 held 58 tryouts in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight was included in the “American-made” flight training standard for that month.
Squadron helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, no other exhibitors of the event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to a representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organization of the exposition in the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep the budget documents of the presidential flights, and the exact costs caused by the event are difficult to ascertain.
But the Department of Defense's hourly compensation rate for FY2017 is $24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron's records indicated the length of the flight was from its main base at Naval Quantico Airfield in Virginia for 30 minutes in both directions.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated reimbursement rates include staff, maintenance and many other irrevocable costs to be taken into account for the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND survey, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are presumably hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it."
It's unclear whether or not Trump encountered a helicopter as part of a tour of the event, but he did get behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump approached representatives of Sikorsky, making fun of media outlets about the company's products in his personal aircraft fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - peace and joy arrived through tears
At the 2011 World Cup in Daegu, Shadeiko was hit in the final area by a foot cramp in the 800 m and the girl was taken away from the stadium with a stretcher.
Just before that, he had scored zero on the Universiade held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki European Championships were marred by an injury, but he finished 23rd at the London Olympics with 6013 points.
But the misfortune continued.
After the opening day of the 2013 Moscow World Cup, an Estonian woman in the distance jump of the record suffered a foot injury.
Two years later, he finished 15th at the Beijing World Cup, but this was also a disappointment for the athlete.
The heaviest gauntlet was passed through by Shadeiko only last year, when it was not possible to get a result in the long jump at the Amsterdam EMI.
I'd just like to put together a good multi-competition once and for all.
One time," Shadeiko confessed.
The worst was yet to come: a month later, his Olympic race in Rio was interrupted by a thigh injury at the very first hurdle.
Time to go back to the 7th edition?
Is two days worth it?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I was able to think straight.
It’s hard to describe this experience, but I’ve thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think straight.
"I knew I wasn't going to put the pills in the bag yet," Shadeiko says of her self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the page and move on.
According to trainer Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the ward, but she understood that first of all, the athlete has to figure it out for himself.
He was so spoiled by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit, on the other hand, said that he would not give up and he wanted to prove to himself what he was worth," says Mägi.
Now there's some peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition returned in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6,280 points in the Götzis multi-competition.
In the high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark in the shot put by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran in a near-record time hurdles race.
Then the multi-competitor sensed that it was not at all a ceiling of abilities, but only the initial hunger for competition was eliminated.
Mägi, who has mentored him for years, says that Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He's a ready athlete. He's good to train.
If something goes wrong or something goes wrong, he says it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his senses.
That's what we're supposed to do.
I can’t say exactly what to do and I will follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
“I’m not the kind of person who gets the most out of training,” he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Your baby’s happiness is happy
The happiness of our loved ones has also provided us with good emotions.
Both her former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-athlete has received support from the new members of the world.
"It's been really interesting," says Shadeiko.
One type of alcohol is “drinking” the brain.
Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
He says it’s not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but about the “very active” process of tasting wine.
By smelling the glass, swirling the wine in the mouth, enjoying it, and perceiving the aftertaste, we make our brains work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Shepert, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste is created by the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares how the brain "sees" colors.
“Taste isn’t in wine, taste creates a taster of wine,” says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the way wine tastes are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes us that wine isn't about getting drunk.
“There has to be more,” he says.
If you take a sip too big, the system is oversaturated.
According to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk memory loss, loss of balance, and reduced mental performance.
10% of Estonian ICT sector employees earn less than their colleagues
Data from the personnel search company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay than their colleagues.
The 10% pay gap is between men and women.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontes ICT sector wage survey.
In total, 8,577 posts were surveyed.
63% of jobs were occupied by men.
"Although only three companies stated that the pay gap favours men and the rest of the companies believe that there is no pay gap, in reality compared to each other, the men's monthly basic salary is on average 10% higher than that of women and the men's annual salary is 8% higher than that of women," said Ilmar Põhjala, analyst at Fontes.
'Narcos' Season 3 commercial clip: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali cartel takes centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the fact that Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first has already produced a promotional clip that teases the series with new villains.
In the third season, the DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug company - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers "like a Fortune 500 company", simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) leads the ties with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York City.
In the newly released commercial, Pedro sees Pascal returning as Javier Pena, a character who enlists American and Colombian law enforcement to aid in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe, and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos opens on September 1.
UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's role in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the recently registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to overemphasize the importance of the role of women," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only truly represent the people and be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Afghanistan's local council elections and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
For its part, the Taliban has threatened an electoral process that coincides with a transition period in which the role of international military operations becomes consultative.
This year’s election marks the first time that power has been peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything bigger, both big and small.
There is always too little common time, but training with the kids gives a good opportunity to combine being together, play, closeness and load.
And what a convenient solution – wherever you cruise in the summer, live dumbbells are always with you and impatiently remind your little voice: “Let’s do some exercise!”
Start with a warm-up - it is very good to play a game of hawks or run along the beach.
A squat is the foundation for keeping your legs and buttocks in shape – who would want to take the shape of a sand cake washed from the waves during the summer?
It's wonderful to use a lever instead of a child!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually increases at the same pace as the strength of the trainer.
The advanced ones can also do squats with quite large children.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions, and enjoys the opportunity to be tall and important.
Older children can also do the same.
The extent of the movement is determined by touching the earth and stretching out your arms.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-assor to hold on tight.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is super useful, but a hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
It’s easy to make it more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank column to alternate through.
It's actually harder than usual, but it's a lot more fun to do when you can shake hands with a friend.
To add to the load, the plumage, a little at the back, can persist, and in this position also walk around.
For added weight, the little one can be seated on the hips, but this exercise will be fun for all children.
While crabs scramble in the sand, the triceps, buttocks, and abdominoplasties get the load just as the snapper did.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight is equally distributed in front and back.
You can hold hands for safety.
Bend your legs and straighten up.
A kid can fly, have fun, work out his balance and be a weight.
The life of a little coach is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
The extra load is provided by stretching the legs forward.
Make sure your back is in a neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot more fun doing the abs in pairs and clap.
Handjobs and a skeet with a pulse.
Observe the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All children's favorite and great fun!
For the parent while truly effective throughout the body workout.

A journey from the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans
Straw bags are a summer classic that has become a hit in recent years, one of the true summer enthusiasts even has to hang on to, and the merchants have managed to weld a price tag for the hit despite its modest origin.
A bag made of straw is probably one of those things that everyone has had once in their life and the possession of which has not caused much emotion.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, straw bags are making a real triumph and fashion fans have exchanged their fancy designer bags for simple straw bags for the summer months.
It’s not just a beach bag, but it’s equally popular today as a street bag, and the bravest women even walk into the office with it.
However, it is worth first learning whether the boss is still sitting on such a summer look or whether it is still worth pushing the notebook and notebook to a slightly more formal sumadan.
The variety has made straw bags a true summer’s love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that stands out is that fashion gourmands are the first thing on a holiday trip to the local market and buy themselves a straw bag, which will be loyal to the whole holiday time, and which accompanies them on the beach, in the market, as well as hanging out with their girlfriends on the town.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand-in-hand to become the happy owners of some bags.
In a way, this madness is understandable, because it is rare that in fashion it is possible to buy something that has risen to the status of a hit for just a few tens of euros.
It is true that clever merchants have also found a simple way to make money here, and thus the finer luxury brands sell straw bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably so that the richer customers wouldn’t have to feel like mere mortals promenading around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana straw bag that costs over a thousand euros.
Chanel’s shoulder bag, however, could be worth around €6,000.
Unlike most fashion hits, however, straw bags do not originate from a few big fashion meccas, but their story began from far away.
It is said that the straw bags come from far away in the Philippines, from where they have been transported.
Straw bag weaving is mainly an expo business and the locals do not go around with it very often.
The straw-making technique is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite similar to conventional basket weaving.
However, since the straw bag does not need to be braided as tightly as the basket, patterns and other materials can be woven into it, which makes the bag more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, recently there have been particularly trendy bags with braids or leather bands woven into them.
The thank-you note can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest straw bag fan ever.
In fact, he was a fan of all kinds of clothing and didn’t even want to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of bags today is not less important, but the fact that caring for them is a rooster’s head and, unlike all other sumadans, they do not need to be cared for with special means, but water and a wet towel will also do the job.
As is the case with trendsetters, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations besides the classic look.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a straw braided pendant or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic straw bag never goes out of fashion, but a straw bag does.
But what is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, it has been considered classic to have a straw-woven bag that resembles a basket in its style, is open on the top and has short handles, as well as straw-like handles.

GMB worries about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union expects the executives of McVitie’s to confirm long-term production plans at the company’s Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent on the future of the investment at the Tollcross site.
The plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The owner of the company McVitie's, Pladis, said they have invested more than £5 million in the object over the past few years.
Employees were hired there, and the union presidents "are the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's operations.
In a letter to the company’s site manager, GMB Scotland appealed to McVitie’s to “solve concerns that funding will not be used to modernize production lines.”
GMB Senior Managing Director Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we don’t get clarity from the site’s general manager on Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plan is causing our members deep concern.
Many generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people of the area around Glasgow, an essential pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
Therefore, the eastern part of Glasgow desperately needs McVitie’s, a company with strong productivity growth in terms of jobs, wages and welfare, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production.”
A spokesperson for Pladis said: "The Tollcross object manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to him as we value active communication with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting took place in Tollcross between employees and GMB representatives, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with the employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure that we are competitive.
He added: "Over the past few years, we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross site, most of which has gone into production lines and operational improvements.
We fully understand Tollcross's legacy as a production site, and should there be any change in the site's operations, workers and union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona against approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in an attempt to lure Neymar into its ranks by making a bid of £189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-breaking conquest?
This sensational approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record for buy-in set last season with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United for £89 million.
As a result, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, receiving over £500,000 a week in salary from PSG after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be angry about both the approach and Neymar's break-out, although a source close to the Catalans' board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such a possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi sternly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
“I don’t worry because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will confront them and contact them,” he said.
“We respect every club.
But when they try to make a deal with one of our players, they have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italians leave under any circumstances, and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest, losing one of their precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit
"Brexit is seriously threatening to drive the wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the UK and Ireland", Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
“This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders,” he said.
Varadkar said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and since it is not possible to do so, it would prefer to remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish prime minister said.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Surely we could have one with Britain."
An alternative would be to return to customs posts, which would proclaim historical division and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace", he said.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
During his visit to Belfast, the Irish Prime Minister met with leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland.
In his first half-length triathlon, Märt Avanti: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, the biggest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital Otepää, when about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries took part in the half-length Ironman competition.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi also won the first triathlon of his life.
"I thought it was going to be difficult, and it was difficult in the end," he said.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that triathlon is actually affordable for almost everyone.
“It’s not the distance that kills, but the pace that kills,” he said, suggesting that almost everyone will reach the finish line at an affordable pace.
He said, “Physics is fine, but you can’t swim.”
He had been training hard since February.
4-5 hours a week, then 10 hours a week.
With a time of 05:34:12, he finished in 270th place overall.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other competitors in the so-called "prominent class".
Tanel Padar, who was a "good example person" last year, lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
German Johannes Moldan was crowned the overall winner of the Otepää stage with a time of 3:58:27, Estonians had the best Ivo Suur with a time of 04:14:09.
Among the women, Helle Frederiksen from Denmark won with a time of 04:24:01, and of the Estonians, Maria Jänese, who lost to Frederiksen in about half an hour and got a time of 04:58:58.
Avandi completed a 1.9 km swim in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410.
