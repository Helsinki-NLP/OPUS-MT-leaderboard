You have to get there.
Why at home?
Asa and his father.
Do not hold back.
I am new.
I shall not be afraid.
We know what you are doing.
How does your father feel?
I know what they said.
Why don’t we go there together?
We will see each other again!
An axhead!
I don’t have a place to live.
Yes, you can.
I gave birth to my first child a year ago.
I am sure that I have seen her again.
You are a good person.
Where is your family?
The best way to do so would be to avoid going in trouble.
Famine.
I am a college graduate.
I missed my keys.
We are not alone.
I want you to know.
What are the benefits?
He knew exactly what was required of them.
It made me think.
I am one of your students.
Why not learn French?
On the contrary, it is totally reasonable to believe that it will happen.
I want to see you.
I’m glad you are there.
When does it arise?
Does Tom know why?
When am I?
We have no money.
Forgive me!
I don’t need them.
I talked to my parents about everything.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
Yes, indeed.
During the blink of an eye, it may fade.
I lost my pencil.
When does it arise?
You can find any color you want.
She baked all the dough.
They have no money.
You are a good parent.
Come or come?
I want to take you.
Do you want to become rich?
I had a headache.
If you don’t hear, they will come.
This is my father.
I’m curious.
What does he not understand?
I don’t think he is here.
I can’t believe it.
They say that he is very rich.
His Word was remarkable.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
She knows each other very well except her parents.
I was able to do it.
I don’t think he is here.
It was desire.
The sun shines directly overhead.
Why not?
It will be very good.
That’s OK.
I remember that first day.
Do you want to take them?
Named after.
Let me explain.
My sister was not at home.
My parents called me to the bottom of my room.
What are they doing here?
Do you have a brother?
Now look at the picture.
I’m on a car.
What are you able to do?
Your mother?
Why are the heavens like blue?
If you do not know, come anyway.
This vehicle is ours.
No one here in the house has a car.
The choice is yours!
I do not know the word.
Light.
I’m glad you are there.
Are you looking for us?
Remember!
For what purpose?
They don’t give me a chance.
My daughter is getting married in the sixth month.
I know these women.
I understand what you say.
I don’t feel quite so good.
Where do you know my name?
Do you want to, or do you want to?
Is this love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, November and December are twelve months of the year.
I have a question.
I felt that you were married.
You’re going or you’re going?
Previously, he was a teacher.
Take your time.
I did!
Who Do You View Me?
I see it too.
You want to get to know them.
Vows are made voluntarily, of one’s own free will.
He is not with you.
I don’t like these people.
Do you want something to drink?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
She listened with rapt attention.
It seemed to me that he was a failure.
Take a taxi to the hotel.
You do not come, do you?
He is here!
Allow him.
I don’t know how long.
Whose side is this?
Old Age — Is It Better?
Not at all!
No one knows what needs to be done.
Do not look down on them.
I shall ask him.
We return.
I’ll see you.
I know a lot about you.
That’s OK.
I want to learn French.
My car was shattered.
You know that I love you.
I knew him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is happening.
He left the key of his car.
Why were you not at home?
Can I see it again?
Do you know how to make a distinction between the sheep and the goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I’ll take you to school.
Do I know Tom?
Are you satisfied?
Will I ever see myself again?
That is why I love you.
Are you in your home?
The heat will be intense.
Give me a contract.
1.
It’s too hot.
You know that I love you.
The bed is a hot and humid climate.
Our journey comes from time immemorial.
I accepted the money.
What would you like to see?
How do you go to school?
Are you new?
I know what needs to be done.
Do you enjoy studying?
Do you have money for me?
I’m not sure.
I know how to do this.
Which ones?
I’m glad you are there.
This book is a wonderful book.
You are killing my family.
I respect them.
Absolutely!
He is powerful.
The amount is five dollars.
I fled to my mother’s house.
No, it is not.
Your lung is dirty.
I point to you.
Thank you for taking the time to go over this with you.
Do you enjoy studying?
I will give it to you.
Just eat a little, and you will have to drink something.
I want to.
You are my friend.
Where is our car?
No one knows what needs to be done.
Which school do you attend?
You do not want to know!
He is a good student.
They pop up unexpectedly.
Accept the book and read it.
I don’t have a home.
Thank you very much.
I know you said that.
I thought about it.
He is happy.
I was hungry.
You don’t know.
Do not say so.
I wish you could go home.
My daughter is left in the lurch.
He was raised by his grandmother.
I let him down.
I want to go home.
They do not know.
I have my brother.
I left that suit.
How long do you want to last?
Early the next morning, I left home at two in the morning.
I gave up my motels.
Why were they here?
What is love?
We understand.
I love the book.
Would you please read those verses?
You are my dear wife.
I’ll be happy with you.
It is ours.
Where is your family?
Do not say the word again.
Good morning, I’ll send one to you.
Where are we going?
I don’t know how I’m doing.
You know where I will be.
What is the purpose of your visit?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
You stop that car.
I’m not sure.
Do you know what you must do?
We know.
No, thank you.
Where do you want to live?
I love the place I live in.
Don’t worry.
Should I Open a Window?
A few drops of rain.
Where are you going?
You must even be very happy.
You have to go home.
Is he here?
Do you learn French?
You will be moved to repentance all the more.
Please visit me.
Where is my car?
I don’t know how.
There my brother.
I know what I do.
I gave a boy a book.
Who is your teacher?
I am doing it with you.
This girl is dressed as a boy.
I am not my brother.
Sadly, after moving, my older friend moved to another town.
Are they at home?
You know I have to go.
Here’s your copy.
It’s not my day.
For how long?
If he had stayed at home that day, he would have had no accident.
He speaks not only English but also German.
I am not happy.
I know what is happening.
I know you.
Right, wrong?
I know what you think.
Intensity.
I didn’t have the right settings, so I had to change it.
The best way to do so would be to avoid going in trouble.
This girl is dressed as a boy.
I like to see you at work.
I have to work on my hair.
Lesser?
The owner of the business is my brother.
I’m happy and content.
Do you have time to help me with something?
Turn it off.
I don’t know them by name.
Do you know what love is?
The marriage takes place on Saturday.
“ I won’t die.
Tell me your goal.
Is this literature unique?
I lost my pencil.
Thank you for coming.
I’m a cook.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
I missed a school.
Go ahead.
Did you notice it?
Are they seeing us?
Are you a good organizer?
When I come up from the field, everything is chaotic.
Is there a father?
We have come to see you.
They are young people.
“ Let’s say, Tom, you have the strength to say, Do not worry!
Remember to keep in touch.
I know that he loves me.
There’s a way to look.
I too am going to school.
I don’t have a brother.
I struck me with a bullet on my finger.
What do you see?
He is shy.
Do you know where?
Where is your father?
Do not ask me again.
My father is at home.
I wouldn’t trade the beach for anything.
Japanese?
Give me a book.
You are a good person.
These windows move south.
I forgot to buy bread.
I will walk in the day of God.
We can’t see it.
Where do you come from?
We are here for you.
I don’t know where he lives.
There are a hundred people in the hall.
I understand.
He has no teeth.
Not really.
My dream had come true.
You can stay close to me.
I don’t know what to say...
Do you know where?
I am not a university student.
Let me see.
Are you our spouse?
Do good to those hating you.
Not one.
They are small in comparison.
Scientists do not do anything today.
We are so happy.
The girl is striking.
Come and visit me.
I am not a good carpenter.
You don’t know.
Tell them what happened.
I wish you could go home.
I am with you.
I love your vehicle.
Who is your teacher?
Are you home?
Does that appeal to you?
It should.
Undoubtedly.
Have I been successful?
I do not know him.
I’m glad you are there.
I need a lot of comfort.
I dropped it.
Make no mistake about it, you might be able to judge matters accurately in another way.
I don’t know what to think about.
I don’t know what to do.
What accounts for this?
Where am I?
Do you know his name?
Money spent.
I want to buy a car.
I want to go too.
It’s not good enough.
What is your hour?
We said good - bye.
Right then and there!
I missed my keys.
I do not pronounce it sacred.
I don’t expect you to be somewhere else today.
I want you to.
This house is my home.
I’m delighted in your car.
They say that he is very rich.
No one can be certain.
Walk or Not?
We walk away.
There was a temple on this site.
I know you said that.
Oh, skinny.
Why not go home?
Do you feel that way?
They don’t give me a chance.
What would you like to see?
Why do you ask?
He is here!
They don’t look at me with an air of pity.
I am sure that you are strong enough.
Get what you want.
I know the girl.
They did not die.
You are a good parent.
Are you looking for a car?
I don’t have any money.
Do your schoolwork.
I want to accompany you.
All I know is that name.
Asa and his mother.
I will make you happy.
We understand it.
What is the family like?
I speak a little Spanish.
And by all means!
How old is he?
I need to know the reasons.
You are not our brother.
My family is small.
Does Tom know the reasons?
A mouse away from home?
I love mathematics.
I know.
Not one.
Nothing happened.
We see each other.
Not at all!
Where is Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where did you come from?
I don’t know French well.
When do you go?
They have no money.
Tell them what happened.
What is this phone number?
The atmosphere.
It’s not fun.
Let me go back to the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will likely happen.
They saw him.
Is all the travel appropriate?
I don’t expect you to be somewhere else today.
He nodded.
Are you our spouse?
It is not something to boast about.
May above!
I love the car.
I know where I’m going.
Yours is similar to yours.
How much is it worth?
Take your time.
Not at all!
Where do you want to live?
See.
He listens to me.
Remember to keep in touch.
We are here for you.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Take your shoes away.
They know us.
When does it arise?
I will not be disappointed.
I came from England.
Let me explain.
Let me explain.
The windows are open.
You don’t have to come.
She listened with rapt attention.
I never forgot it.
I don’t think he is here.
That’s OK.
Combling is a mixture of rice and beans.
I know how to do this.
You were not asked.
They want us to do that.
What do you see on the outside?
I know it really makes you happy.
I shall lack nothing.
Where is Tom?
What is French?
The owner of the literature is my sister.
From tomorrow we may be able to get us to work.
We arrived.
I am learning French at home.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they are going.
It is a unique book.
Our feet are heavy.
I know your father.
Learn French in school.
You have to go home.
Where do all people go?
Can You Open a Window?
Will you move here to this day?
Where is my mother?
Not now, when?
What do you want?
Where is your car?
My father was not at home.
It is a simple matter.
Do you know anything?
We are not left on our own.
Are you looking for them here?
There are no wealthy people here.
Here a hole in the ground is surrounded by a hole in the ground.
A carpenter.
It’s good to see you.
My father was not at home.
Look!
What is this phone?
You can sing the song.
Forgive me so much!
I know how to do it well.
It is not hungry.
If so, you can understand it.
Where are we?
Love is not blind.
Let me explain.
I know you do.
I’m not a student.
I’ll try.
I wind up and can’t move faster.
Probably not.
It was my sister.
I do not give up.
How Much Time Will You Give Up?
Asa and his Father.
What are these?
It was successful.
My house is next to the place of worship.
Defer to a word!
And all the knees that are fallen down shall be eaten by the pigs.
I couldn’t wait.
I do not want to read them.
Five of them know his name.
Do you know where they were?
Where do you go to school?
Where?
The very notion is absurd!
He gave it to me.
I never saw him.
Where is your mouse?
We listen.
Why do people say that?
The passing of time is of great value.
I have made a sworn oath.
I do not speak French.
No one!
Why do I have to do so?
It is Saturday.
So I did that.
I’m a cook.
How many?
We have no money.
I know you’re listening.
Take your shoes off.
I know what it looks like.
I was happy.
Is this car new?
Why don’t you go in?
She did not read the book.
I do not want to be rich.
Please forgive me.
A helmet does not have teeth.
That will make you happy.
You can go.
When Do You Come Home?
She did not read the book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is a new one.
A carpenter.
Frenchman.
I don’t have a car.
Pay attention to your head.
Why not make it clear what you have in mind?
I want you to meet me.
You can use this car.
He is a warrior.
I’m a teacher.
I loved him.
I’m not a student.
Would you like to see this?
Let us say that!
I love you.
He came on his own.
I bought eggs and a few eggs.
One fold is missing.
I saw him again.
Is this your mother?
We grew up as a family.
What was that purpose?
Do you want us?
I’ll be in my car.
I don’t like running.
Frenchman.
He is a tall son.
I know what they are like.
You know how well they do.
I have a car.
When will you come to your home?
In the evening, from 6: 00 p.m. to 6: 00 p.m., it is a time for rejoicing.
You do not have to come.
You have to stop drinking.
Have empathy for your mother.
There’s a way to look.
Where did you stop the car?
Minute between 1 hour and 2 hour.
Let the man on the housetop not come down, nor go inside to take anything out of his mouth.
Shall I wear a rat or a skirt?
Which book?
The Americans?
What do they look like?
Let me go back to the beginning.
I am reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
Not so with you!
Find us?
Where are your belongings?
What error?
Drink.
He is here!
I Will Not Forget It
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.
We are happy.
Keep it covered and fresh.
I don’t respect it.
I carry them.
Famine.
I understand.
Not really.
Learn French in school.
Why?
I want you to go home.
Asa and his mother.
Do you search for me?
Put it in your mother’s arms.
You know I have to go.
Where is the automobile?
Do you love him?
We have to put an image between outputs and inputs.
The serpent caused the snake, or serpent, to strike.
They do not come today.
Do You Know What It Is?
Open a Window!
What a dear family that is!
The son is a brother.
Why Not Go to School?
Why not go home?
Can I get in?
You know that I love you.
Researchers have found a skeleton in a cave.
Our journey depends on time.
Can I see them again?
These steps can prevent disease from escalating.
I am the factory.
We are told to eat together in the day.
Do not get angry!
Not a conversation; we simply go to the movie anyway.
I fell in love with her.
Why Not Go Home?
Come out of my room!
I am new.
I want to learn French.
I am coming to you.
I’m not my sister.
I lie down without cause.
I have a purse.
The waters receded.
If I had, I would have gone.
I try to express my thoughts and feelings in words.
What is the price?
I know where we are.
Why Do They Not Come?
I’m going to get my car back.
Why are you not in the classroom?
We are students of the university.
I don’t know his name.
I’ll have to slow down.
How do you go to school?
Forgive me!
Turn it off.
Do not put it off!
Do you know what it is?
Please forgive me.
I know his family.
I know how.
I missed my keys.
I’m content with this.
They don’t give me a chance.
What is the purpose of your visit?
Why not?
She does not speak English.
I ate eggs the next day.
Fine, isn’t it?
We know him.
I want to get some rest.
You were not asked.
It is not hungry.
I was in a state of shock.
I talked to my parents about everything.
I rise at 7: 00 a.m.
Do not open a window.
Well, do not pass over them too quickly.
Why not?
Why the heat?
Unless it is raining, he goes to work.
It is ours.
Do not look at the weather.
How does your sister feel?
Can We Get to Know Each Other?
Where are you going?
I loved the car.
Why learn French?
I think so.
I have seen them.
I know whoever listens to you.
He accused the man of stealing.
This went on for me.
I’m deaf.
I don’t know their names.
Explain your goal.
I know what to do.
They say that he is very rich.
Your lung is dirty.
Are you not a German?
Do you love him?
"Is this one popular?" – "Father."
You don’t need to be ungrateful.
When did you meet the next evening?
We want you to take them.
Asa and his mother.
Being alone, let us make sure that we have a balanced view of ourselves.
We visited you.
Do you want to, or do you want to?
It’s not my car.
I don’t know his name.
Do you want something to drink?
You do not know what has happened, do you?
I know what love is.
Not one.
The shield - bearer likely stops.
What are you doing here?
I am the factory.
I am getting ready.
We are studying in the same library.
Where?
It made me think.
Do you have rice?
Is he here?
We can find it.
We are born.
I know why you are here.
Why did you study college?
Where is your mouse?
Sooner or later, he will be confronted with the reality of those words.
When Do You Come?
I dropped off.
Thankfully, you can.
Listen to your mother!
Read this.
I will give it to you.
What news?
They were in my room!
Is the tea wrong?
Do you want something to drink?
I am the youngest.
How much is it worth?
I would like to read this book.
I left in Bresil.
I’ll take you home.
We are studying in the same library.
Do Not Forget You!
Write to us.
Do not jump to conclusions.
Do you have this money?
They are small in comparison.
It is his job.
That is what you have asked for.
He is our brother.
What do you want?
Am I Addicted to Electronic Media?
It was desire.
I want to.
Don’t give orders here!
We sometimes take them into the movie.
Are you not here?
What did you read?
Where are we?
Why do we do it?
These are extremely tall.
Do you believe that it does not matter to me?
There are gaps — missing pieces — in the layers.
He is our brother.
It is his job.
Do you know what they said?
I’m not sure.
They do not know.
American?
A cup or a tea?
What is going on?
Please, let me bring you out to the toilet.
We are alone.
I love what I do.
My voice has been uprooted from my work.
Do you know what that meant?
His Word was perfect.
When do you want to go?
I don't know anything like this.
Is that better?
The Japanese?
I’ll try.
Does he or she know that you love him?
We are wasting precious time.
Why do you not give up?
Send a meeting talk that is appropriate for you, without being distracted by other languages.
Where is his family?
Magdalena and Anita are good friends.
I’m happy and content.
We need to eat together during the day.
Consider one.
Do you have a brother?
We got back together.
I do.
I have to think.
Where is Mary?
I was devastated.
I have to finish.
I’m glad you are there.
Do you think you are happy?
Why are you not with me?
Not at home.
That is what I have said.
She fell in love with him.
She is not pregnant.
Why?
How Much Should I Donate?
What did you give me?
Stay outside.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not rich.
He wipes his face from the fire.
Not really.
Too late!
I will be a part of them.
How many nights?
Yes.
I came for a greeting.
You have to go home.
Asa and his Father.
Send me. ’
Do you know where he lives?
I don’t like it.
Why don’t you go with me?
Give me your hour.
Do you have my money?
It is a marvel of design.
I wish you could go home.
I don’t have a brother.
I don’t know.
I don’t know my names.
Can You Do the Same?
I guess you.
Do you know these people?
Is this a bad idea?
Why do I do it?
I don't understand.
This industry produces automation.
I’m not a student.
It makes sense to do so.
Do not do that again.
Position in window.
I don’t like it.
One fold is missing.
Get the money.
He is happy.
Running in the car.
Would you like to know why?
Do you want to?
Remember your kindness, and do not forget it.
I am the youngest.
What do you think this is?
We wanted talks in the language of the day.
So why bring you here?
I’m not sure.
I came to study.
He did not say a word.
We are born.
It’s too hot.
So I did that.
“ I have to learn.
Thank you very much!
Of course he does.
Does that make you happy?
You're ours.
What was that purpose?
I don’t have any more roommates.
We are students of the university.
There is nothing new.
Are you one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
Why not try a method that suits you?
No one had seen anything.
I’ll try.
I want to ask, What are you going to do?
I know the girl.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He needs water.
Where have you been?
That’s OK.
I’m glad you are doing.
How many cups of coffee have you drank?
What is wrong with this office?
This car is very beautiful.
Yes.
We were exhausted.
We’ll do that.
Your background?
I know you do.
I’m sorry I’m going to tell you something wrong.
Children.
By means of the professor.
We headed down to the mountains.
I do not remember any names.
Do you want to become rich?
I would like to read this book.
Never may that happen.
I am a university student.
These publications are designed for our consideration.
They do not want us to know.
It’s not my car.
You're on the red light.
I know what I was told to learn.
I miss you very much.
I’m hearing what you say.
I want you to go home.
We go together.
Give a chance.
I am not strong.
Nobody!
It is not something to be proud of.
Do you understand French?
They pop up unexpectedly.
1.
How large is this wine?
I have my brother.
They do not waste a lot of time.
You call when you need help.
So do I.
We got off the bus.
Here they are not wealthy.
What does he want to accomplish?
Listen to your mother!
I love mathematics.
He is here!
We go there together.
Over the next week, we will return.
I’ve always liked your recipe.
What do you do?
That’s where I don’t have to look.
Come in too?
You know that we love him.
You can separate the sheep from the goats.
I’ll have to think about that.
He listens to me.
I love to learn French.
It is possible that we can travel to the beach at this end of seven times.
Why do they do it?
You do not come, do you?
You have to go home.
How old is he?
I knew it.
I Will Not Forget It
He does not seem to be happy.
I know where I’m going.
Unless that rain falls, he goes to work.
Thank you very much!
I don’t want to quit.
What is going on?
I’ll see a game.
It seems very good.
I am reading a book.
Do you know who the car is?
That’s where I don’t have to look.
You are a good student.
Remember this.
I am sure that I was able to see him again.
Do you have time for it?
I love short hair.
Are you planning to attend the meeting?
The shower has stopped me.
Disorientation.
Allow him.
Too late!
Why do you feel that way?
I have my sisters.
He passed the tree branch by his turn.
Come with you?
He does not love us.
Not at all!
Not good.
So read a lesson in French.
It will be very good.
I have made a sworn oath.
It is a way.
Everything is so rewarding.
I had a morning of many chores.
We enjoy it very much.
Let us buy it.
I’m not a good person.
I know what I’ll do.
What would you like to know?
We know why you have come here.
My grandmother talks slowly.
I’ll try.
I love to learn French.
She is pregnant.
I wouldn’t have come.
What do you think this is?
Can I open the door?
That was the day!
I know what to do.
I am a university student.
Listen.
Where is my money going?
I see you.
Are you at home?
I know whoever listens to you.
I would like to talk with you.
I enjoy what I see.
I know what you think.
It depends on you.
I am learning French at home.
Your sister?
We are born.
They do not come today.

What do you want?
Where do you stand with me?
I am getting ready.
I do not give up.
Do not say so.
Get the money.
Why me?
I’ll be back.
Let me devour the food prescribed for you, O Jehovah.
Find us!

The bus stops but is not finished.
Do you love him?
The road is full of sounds.
I read her letter to me.
Take for example in French.

A large glass surface, or one that closes to the center?
Do not say so.
I’m the surgeon in the operating room.
We returned many times without incident.
Where do you know him?
Where do you want to go?
I have to quit.
We need not guess.
He is a good man.
I’ll be happy with you.
I want to see you again.
Banish!
I want to see you.
Are you not looking forward to that?
You are my friend.
We listen.
Why at home?
Here are your plans?
These flowers are known as roses.
You are not cramped for room within them.
We might go along.
You know that I love you.
We prepare rice for this purpose.
You are not our brother.
You will not come, do you?
They come to the house.
I’m glad you are there.
I’ll do it.
In the past, you were smoking; did you not?
You can find any color that pleases you.
It is useless.
What error?
You are a good cook.
What is the fault?
Do you know what that meant?
I was in a state of shock.
Would you like to know?
Prices go up.
My left hand had a big knuckles.
This is mine.
Smoking kills your health.
My father’s car is new.
No, I haven’t.
I can’t believe it.
Tell me, if you do know understanding.
You need a goal.
You stop me.
Are you ready to quit?
I love my family.
I don’t want to be here.
You are young people.
I need time to think.
This car is my car.
Close window!
I don’t understand French.
Remember to keep in touch.
I’m curious.
It’s fun.
I know it’s fun.
This is offensive!
I knew it.
Is that what you are seeking?
I loved you.
I don’t know your name.
I'll take a break.
Look out of your head.
He has hundreds of books.
Do not listen to him.
The shadows are mine.
What do you do?
We want the best for them.
I still suffer a little.
The book does not contain an invitation.
I don’t want to see you.
He is a good student.
You do not have to write a long letter.
Let me devour the food prescribed for you, O Jehovah.
You are a good student.
Which ones?
These compartments are in danger of death.
They were happy.
Do you want to attend?
He loves her.
Where is your father?
Read again.
I know you’re listening.
Five of them know his name.
I will drive.
You are not my brother.
Work in a factory.
That is what I have said.
Look ahead!
She is always free.
Look at it this way.
Of course not!
I knew him.
Close window.
The factory will begin its work year after year.
Prices ran high.
This year I plan to read as many books as possible.
I don’t feel quite so well.
We are born.
The hand has five fingers — the thumb, the ball, the big toes, the thumb, the back.
I have found your father.
What are you reading?
Not at home.
Where is my car?
At first, the mats were often flat and flat.
Do you have a car?
Why do they say that?
I don’t know how to cook.
Keep it cool and calm.
How do you feel about the fifth?
I’m glad you are there.
Of course he does.
"What are these trucks?" – "They belong to the Father."
I know what I’ll do.
No, he was not.
Let’s look at her milk!
Is it wrong now?
Would you please make a note of me?
I don’t want to know.
Remember to deliver a letter.
If he had, he would have stayed.
The one getting married usually does not hesitate to speak to her father.
He listens.
You must be right.
They are beautiful, universal.
What is the family like?
You want to find it.
We arrived.
Whose Study Is He?
Why do people hate me?
I spent a lot of time studying the guitar.
Not necessarily.
Please, let me bring you out to the toilet.
I was hungry.
Thank you.
Why not?
Why do you have something good?
Where is the automobile?
Now I have to go.
My car was shattered.
We are at home.
We are happy to see them.
How does your father feel?
I love mathematics.
He is a warrior.
He will likely come tomorrow.
I too am on the run.

I know how to use them.
I’m getting used to this.
Let me see.
He left the key of his car.
Are you a new student?
I don’t feel quite so good.
Why do we do this?
May I, please, curse you.
I don’t have a car.
You do not come, do you?
He is happy.
Because you face a challenge.
Do You Recall?
Awake!
He knew exactly what was required of them.
I thought it was in bad shape.
What to do?
Because I am in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I want you to know.
I know what it will mean for me.
I do not like studying.
No one can be certain.
They want us to do that.
Are you here?
Close all windows.
I want to go home.
I had a morning of many chores.
I gave up my motels.
Some of these workers are not trained to do this work.
What are you doing here?
They were not happy.
Baffled?
Make the needed corrections.
Are you not interested in knowing why?
Asa and his brother.
I listen to you.
Why are you not with me?
I don’t want your money.
A day!
I know what needs to be done.
I used to feel a pain in my throat.
I have schoolwork.
I am sure you would attend.
Do not do that again!
Let me first buy bread.
My daughter is left in the lurch.
I know.
January is the first month of the year.
I was about four in the morning.

We meet there.
Be a good listener.
I want to be with you.
Languages shape the way they speak.
In the past, there were churches here.
We care about you.
Who do you think I am?
Why do you not want to go?
Do you not want to know what has happened?
Why do you feel that way?
Why not try this thread, which is closely related to your hatred?
My sister is like my mother.
You can go there.
I want to see you.
I don’t respect it.
Why not?
Do you have a sibling?
She is not a child.
I don’t have any books to read.
We have always been playing in God’s day.
I wash my su and my hands.
What is this home?
Why are you not in the classroom?
I think it’s good.
I don’t know the amount.
I was full of anger.
We are learning French.
I want to see you.
How much time do you want to spend on it?
Asa and his Father.
Five of them know his name.
The window is closed.
Do not try again.
It is a very good book.
This book is a wonderful book.
Go to bed!
The bed is made up of several large pieces of marble.
I’m not sure.
Staying active, Timmy.
We listen.
You have to stop drinking.
“ Talk with me.
I couldn’t wait.
He nodded.
I don’t know.
She had found the very best clothes.
All I know is that name.
Asa and your brother.
Let me explain.
They are different from you.
I found it.
Is it all worthwhile with regard to travel?
I think they are correct.
I am not foolish.
I am here for you.
The student wants to see you.
Shall I wear a rat or a skirt?
I am a college graduate.
Gradually, the child’s attention span.
The environment is pleasing to the eyes, soothing to the nerves.

We headed west.
I heard some laughs at you.
How does she find her home?
I am coming quickly.
Does Your Room Have two Windows?
I have been working in this business for the past year.
They are extremely tall.
I’ll understand.
Why do you have this?
She did not read the book.
You are in Norway today.
Yesterday was all day long, for it was God’s day.
Where is your brother?
I came for a study.
I cannot wash the dirty dishes that have accumulated.
I am on vacation.
Does he or she know that you love him?
I am a baker.
It is my new car.
Get out of the car.
Look at how I do this!
I’m in the kitchen.
It’s wonderful to know your name.
Do you have self - respect?
I know what is happening.
Integrated through a fire.
Do not be put off!
Money has been lost.
What is the family like?
Where?
I love what I do.
We don’t have a car.
Why not?
I will make you happy.
I love to be here.
How do you fit in?
He has a car.
Remember your kindness, and remember what is remaining.
Don’t force me to do so.
I need to see you.
Avoid asking for money.
I know what they are doing.
Do you know how they look?
I’m glad you are there.
Your evening meal is a time of privacy.
You are a young person.
They are not interested in you.
The bus station is five minutes from here.
I don’t think I am.
You are a good cook.
Let me explain.
What Do You Want?
Why did you leave me like this?
When am I?
For refreshments.
I saw him running.
Here is a good question.
I love to read.
This girl is dating to herself as a boy.

Forgive me so much!
Do you?
You are my friend.
What kind of books do you like to read?
She is not a child.
Why do you want to move?
I wish you could go home.
A multimillion - efficient factory is also the month of the month.

I don’t know who they are.
He will love her.
You will not come, do you?
Please open my windows.
Why do I have to go?
Boy, I’ll get it.
I know it will make you happy.
Let me buy a new one.
Think of it!
You're not alone.
Too Big?
He loves her.
He enjoys reading books.
Why don’t you go in?
I don’t know how long they will continue.
You don’t know what is right?
Why don’t you go with me?
Why do you ask?
Decide what you want.
You will win.
She does not speak English.
A car breaks down.
The walls are frozen.
Why do you feel that way?
The strangers do not know their names.
Kana.
Where is your father?
I’ll go to bed.
Could I use it?
Too Long?
Do you see their eyes?
The carpenter?
The payment is, not monthly, but daily.
Come, you?
I am Chinese.
The owner of the car is my father.
Thank you!
Asa and his mother.
We know him.
Flowers and trees need fresh air and fresh water.
I too went to school.
I’m dying to you.
The next day, we will have five more reasons to do so.
By him!
We are not able to understand French.
We do not want to know.
I have money for you.
I have stomach problems.
Do not try again.
I understand what you say.
I understand why you would like to be like that.
I think he will come.
Should you be there with Tom?
Notice how beautiful it is.
No, thank you.
What do you think?
She is not a child.
No one knows where we are.
Probably not.
It is ours.
He does not love us.
It will be very good.
Frenchman.
You received a fiery sign.
Would you like me to come?
I know you’re here.
Stop reading.
They say that he is very rich.
I am sure that I have seen her again.
What about today?
Your skin is bitter with anger, and I don’t doubt that you have fever.
He understands her.
Are you a student?
A good evening!
I don’t know where they are.
Why So Long?
I think I’m sitting on it.
You must be right.
My house is next to the church.
I’m not my sister.
We are not obligated to talk with each other at this time.
I know.
I don’t want this money.
Where is the cook?
You can stay home.
Bring me two bulls.
This vehicle looks like a new one.
When Do You Study?
These windows point to the south.
Do not give up!
So do I.
Why Not Go to School?
What is this phone?
What is this phone?
We know.

He received one.
Where is his family?
What was that?

If you are sick, you need to rest.
Money spent on me.
The parts are white.
There was no one else but me.

I know what I say.
If so, you can understand it.
Last week, my friend happened to be my personal friend.
I go home.
I’ll take it.
We shall return to the beginning.
She fell in love with him.
Where is your brother?
You will not come, do you?
If he had stayed at home, there would have been no problem.
Don’t look nice.
And this is where you have come here?
He will love her.
I see him.
That’s what I’m looking for.
Yes!
I am not good enough.
Please open my windows.
I don’t think so.
My father was not at home.
Do not do that again!
Do you?
No, he was not.
The boy is standing.
The class is over.
Once more I will have done so.
Money spent.
We are students of the university.
I haven’t.
I need to take a deep breath.
I think so.
I found it.
I grabbed hold of him.
Why So Much Hate?
I read this book.
I am coming to you.
I don’t think I am.
Do you know what you must do?
Turn it off.
You are so good - looking.
I don’t think I am.
Take your shoes off.
I know that he loves me.
You are not my brother.
I’ll see.
This day is God’s day.
I know.

Why not?
Opening the window.
Do not forget to ask further questions.
It is 5: missing ten minutes.
We parted.
I know you’re listening.

He is happy.
We don’t have any money.
I don’t know what I want.
Thank you!
This day is three.
Do you know?
Ask her name.
They do not want to use it.

From whom?
I know you’re listening.
Track your progress as you complete each step.
Remember to deliver a letter.
She is a French - speaking person.
I loved him.
Please read on.
I am not a university student.
The door is already locked.
I listen to you.
I think I have the time of the cup of coffee.
We love our park.
Why do you love me?
Don’t be there.
I would like you to read them.
Clarify where you are going.
If so, you can understand it.
I don’t respect it.
The word comes from Greek.
The owner of the business is my brother.
Why do I have to do so?
Why not?
Dead?
I know what needs to be done.
Remember to deliver a letter.
You do not want to know!
I know your mother.
The word is consistently negative.
I found what I was looking for.
Array.
I want news.
Where is my money going?
Why do you ask them?
You have something inside — an inner voice that tells you what to think about and what to do.
Thank you very much.
This girl is dating to herself as a boy.
I came looking for you.
In the days of God I am no more at home.

Is goodness more appealing to humans than goodness?
Do you not sense this?
