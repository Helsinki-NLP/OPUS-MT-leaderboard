An event of the rapid growth of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15, March 2020.
An increasing event of the conditions of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows the same rates in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom to ensure that, although in different regions of the world, the COVID-19 plague is rapidly moving ahead in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals, and emergency units should be more prepared to receive many patients with COVID-19 who will need medical care, and especially care for those with a critical condition.
In 31 December 2019, an unidentified group of pneumonia persons was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the engine that causes the new coronavirus that is now called respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV2 has been named coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80 percent of the people with COVID-19 suffer from mild infections, that is, respiratory or non - pneumonia, and that most of these people are recovering.
In 14%, COVID-19 is developing into a more serious illness that requires hospitalization while 6% of the remaining circumstances are facing a serious emergency that requires emergency care.
The deaths of patients laid down for COVID-19 are 4%.
In this study, we examine the increasing stages of COVID-19 in each European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in the Hubei Province, China.
It also compares the current number of COVID-19 people in the EU/EA and UK and that of Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COID-19 Developments in EU/EA and UK
After China, COVID-19 was widely spread in terms of the environment and the change of the COVID-19 worldwide is now following what is happening in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is an epidemic.
The 5 March of the Eurosurveillance 2020, the Spierri et al. reported on the first confirmed individuals of the COVID-19 European in accordance with WHO's description.
In the EU/EA, the first confirmed individuals were reported by France on 24, January 2020 by the people who returned from Wuhan, Huei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the COVID-19 people had been discovered in all 30 countries of the EU/EA and the United Kingdom (UK), that is, between 31 December 2019 and that day, 39,768 cases of the virus and 1,277 deaths, were reported here by 17,750 people with the virus and 1,41 who have died in Italy only.
Finding a growing number and an increasing occurrence of the COVID-19
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the figures of HIV-19 persons in each country, obtained only by legal sources like the National Health Department of each country, national and provincial health authorities and WHO, are repeated each day by 8:00 a.m.
This date was used to analyze the COVID-19 stations in EU/EA and UK, compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the frequency of the COVID-19 conditions, we have listed the growing event of the 14 days of the COVID-19 conditions, thus considering the normal continuation of COVID-19, each EURO/EA and UK, during the period of 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also released an increasing number of reported conditions each country on March 15, 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with Italy in 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 rents in EU/EA and UK countries
An increasing 14-day incidence of COVID-19 conditions in EU/EA and UK countries usually follows those of the Hubei Provence (Chinese).
In all the EU/EA and the UK, the growing event of COVID-19 began to rise about 21 February and was very happy on 28 February 2020 (Supreme for reading).
This was greatly increased by the rapid increase in the number of reported conditions from Italy, but the rest of the EU/EA and the UK countries show the same rising rates for the increasing occurrence of the COVID-19 (Supreme for reading).
Photo 2 shows an increasing number of COVID-19 conditions, in EU/EA and UK countries compared with that of Italy in 31 January–15 March 2020.
It makes clear that, on March 15, 8:00 a.m., some 15 EU/EA and UK countries had already reported a total amount that could be compared with that of Italy in 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported conditions of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EA and the UK.
The stations mentioned in the increasing occurrence of COVID-19 show that the plague continues at the same speed in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are divided into different categories, differing from the general public health approach, and likely different descriptions of conditions in countries as well as different prostheses for the choice of patients to be tested to ensure the VIID-19, including follow-up examinations.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian states described a situation in which 10% of the VID-19 patients required emergency care and the press reported that hospitals and emergency units in these regions had reached their highest level.
The time of access to the COVID-19 conditions to the hospital and/or emergency unit is available in the EU/EA category in only 6% and 1% cases, in sequence (not indicated).
It should, however, be gathered in an orderly manner to conform to the current alarm clock that focuses on the number of reported conditions and the number of deaths.
A survey conducted in 2010–11 showed a significant difference regarding the discovery of emergency beds and central care facilities in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds for every 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less help than Italy (12.5 emergency care beds and public care for 100,000 people by 2010–11).
Modeling conditions related to the capacity of health care, which provides a standard for each EU/EA and UK state regarding the increase in conditions in the hospital as related to the COVID-19 risk of crossing the number of emergency beds, is provided as a sixth review of the ECDC risk against COVID-19.
As conditions accumulate in some regions of the EU/EA and UK countries, and emergency - care facilities and units often provide reading services, information about conditions and emergency beds should be available at the level of the Nominenctural units for statistics 2 (NUTS2).
Italy's experience and modern transpiration counters indicate that the CIVID-19 epidemic is rapidly growing in the EU/EA and the UK.
The countries, hospitals, and emergency units should prepare the ongoing SARS-CoV2 connection of the director and the increasing number of OVID-19 patients in need of medical care, and especially critical care, such as that in the affected provinces of Italy.
As shown in recent ECDC surveys of an emergency, a quick, active, and detailed course is important to delay the flow of SARS-COV2, by making a change from control to the slowest route, since the anticipated increase in the number of conditions may not allow decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, to accept and adapt their responses if not in advance.
Early safety tests also mean public health measures to control the cause of the plague.
There is a very small chance for countries to be able to keep control over their efforts to reduce the progression of SARS-CoV2 and reduce stress in health care.
The failure of this, it is possible that medical supplements in some EU/EA countries will meet up with a host of patients who need attention in the future or in weeks.
The spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a fever respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is currently killing over 3,000 people and affecting more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, successful in human disaster.
Like its same virus, SASS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms.
COVID-19, however, has a more serious and mortality rate than SARS, but it is more widely transmitted and affects more adults than the skin and more males than women.
As a way to respond to the rapidly growing number of prints about a new disease, this article strives to provide a timely and detailed review regarding the subject of rapid research.
We will discuss basics about epidemiology, ecology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
While many questions still need answers, we are confident that this review helps us to keep the mind and the means of dealing with life - threatening diseases.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and memorable memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to stay in their homes on vacation and then for many weeks afterward because of the outbreak of new virus disease.
The virus is much like the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of the outbreak of a TB respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CoV2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 11, 2020, and the related disease was called Cov Disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and spread quickly throughout the country and about 50 others around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed conditions of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from the hospital as well as over 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the leading public enemy" and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https:/www.ncb.m.nm. nih.gov/pubmed/), for less than two months, more than 200 pages have been printed regarding the COVID-19 issue of its virology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020, which decided a series of bacteria divided into many patients.
This review tries to speed up the progress of research on the new and rapid development.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CorV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreaks).
We will also review what we have learned so far about the nature of prevention and the cause of sickness and the rest of the important questions.
CoVs generally considered to be non-smokers, primarily responsible for 15% of normal colds 4.
In this century, however, we have had two cases of highly multiple-latons, that is, SARS-CoV and MEORS-CoV, which caused the epidemic that began in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to other countries that caused serious illness and death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third occurrence of the CoV in written human history.
As shown in Death. Year 1.1.1.1, some demonic groups with unknown roots began to be reported at Wuhan on December 31, 2019 in China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the sequence of COV was freed.
On January 15, 2020, the first incident of death in Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, it was reported that the influx of health workers suggested that human contact was a possibility.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed down and all public transport equipment was set up.
On January 24 a study of the first treatment of the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with proven conditions, only 21 had direct contact with the WUhan Sea food market that was considered the first place to be a disease from an unknown source.
On January 30, WHO announced an emergency worldwide health crisis.
By the time of the report, disease has spread throughout China and about 50 countries around the world (Unfa.2).
As the situation quickly turns, the end and the seriousness of the plague remain unclear.
On February 11, 2020, a study of a number of 8,866 patients involving 4,021 that were confirmed to be afflicted by COVID-19 showed a more revised picture of the epidemic in the following way (https:/Weix.q.s.com/s/UlX-HHHHPA1qHA2hdA).
SARS-CoV2 has sickened people throughout the years, but mainly 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50, fewer than 20, and only 14 people under 10.
SARS-CoV2 has infected more males (3.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 grew in large groups of Hubei and nearby again.
The COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average period from beginning to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic production number (R0) was 3.77 (95%: 3.51-4.05), and the modified R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of admissions rose quickly before 23 Jan.20, similar to the time of the massive transport before Spring Festival in China.
The deaths of confirmed patients were 1.44% (95: 1.10-186%), and the changed mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main features of the COVID-19 risk were sex (man), age ( most), and acute pneumonia.
CoVs are part of a family of large, hidden viruses that contain one of the nerve fibers of the RNA.
They can be divided into four parts, that is, alpha, beta, gamma, and deltas, which are known to infect people.
The Spike (S) of the glycoprotein envelope adheres to the receptive cells of an Angiotsin-converting enzyme (ACE2) and the DPP4 (DS-CoV) and MESS-CoV, respectively, and then the recombination of the membrane.
The RNA gene is released from cytoplasm; after the recurrence of the virus gene, the RNA of the gene that is associated with glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein build up the immune cells, which include plasma membranes to release the virus.
The sequence of SARS-CoV2 genes was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV2 was discovered to be a new form of meta-CoV with a 99.98% of a series of samples gathered in the first explosion, the Huananan Sead Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV2 is usually more similar to SARS-CoV than MEORS-CoV.
Using the microscopy to transmit electron transmission, SARS-CoV2 crystals were found in the most clear parts of the epithelium of the airway.
ACE2 persons were found to be SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV2 protein is associated with ACE2 more rapidly than that of SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV2 causes less serious infections than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV2 can also build a new short protein produced by orf3b and a output protein produced by an orf8.
The SARS-CoV2 might play a role in the immune system and may prevent the appearance of IFN seemed; however, the orf8 does not contain any known background or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zou, et al., reported the ACEM building of the ACE2 persons full of features of 2.9 Å associated with the Amino acid vehicle B0AT1.
It was found that this link, composed of open and closed structures, was combined as a diamond and a combination of ACE2-B0AT1 to combine two S proteins, giving evidence of both the appearance of CV and the transmission.
B0AT1 may be a set of medication treatments to suppress the SARS-CoV2 infection.
Ancient and Central Glacier
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MEORS-CoV began on bats and passed to people by civet cats and lawyers, respectively.
In contrast with the SARS-CoV2 phygenic and other Corvs, bats are recognized as the base of SARS-CoV2 as the new virus corresponds to 96% with the SARS from bats called the SL-CoVZX45 bat and the SL-CovZX2 211 bat.
However, the agent who intervened helped the virus to cross the line between the creatures so that it could join humans is unknown, and the transmission route is still to be explained.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may be carrying a virus from bats to people that involved the combining of the youth of the same characteristics within S protocol.
According to surveys, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that long-logalin - long tusks, mammals commonly used as Chinese traditional medicines - it may be the middle range of SARS-CoV2 based on 99% of the genes derived from the Sales-Cov2.
However, 1% of the widespread difference between two genes makes a big difference; hence, the proven effects of hard femininity are still left. (Death.33).
The SARS-CoV2 Physcochemic factors are not currently known.
SARS-CoV and MEORS-Cov can live without a creature up to 48 hours in a dry environment and until 5 days under 20 °C and 40%.
SARS-CoV2 may have similar features.
The SARS-CoV2 is reported to be incompatible with ultraviolet rays and the 56 °C temperature for 30 minutes; ether, 75% of ethanol, chlorine, pactic acid, chloroform, and other chemicals that melt fat, but not chlorhexidine, can make the virus ineffective.
All people lack immune defenses against SARS-CoV2 and therefore are at risk of becoming infected with a new virus.
In the meantime, no further research has been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV2.
Therefore, we can only refer to the previous research on other CVs, especially the SARS-CoV and the MESS-CoV (Unfa.4).
Usually, after the virus attacks the body, it is first seen by natural receptors (PRs) that include receptors such as electrons such as C, receptors like Toll (TLR), node (NLR), and receptor (I).
With different patterns, the virus causes the symptoms of inflammation, the form of dendritic cells, and the production of interferons of I (IFN) that accelerate the spread of the virus and speed up the macrophage phagocytosis of bacterial antigens.
However, SARS-CoV's protein can help the virus to avoid immune reactions.
Soon, the automatic reaction of the immune system joins the battle against the virus.
T lymphocytes for combining the T cells of the CD4+ and the CD8+ play a vital role in protecting.
The CD4+ T cells encourage B cells to produce antibodies against the virus, and the CD8+ T cells directly kill infectious cells.
T cells produce proinflammatory cytokine to help protect the protective cells.
However, COV can prevent T cell activity by producing an Apoptosis of T cells.
The incompetency of herol including such aids as C3a and C5a and immune systems is also important in the fight against infection.
For example, antibodies taken from a healthy patient make MESS-CoV invalid.
On the other hand, overstimulating the body’s reaction creates a large concentration of radials in an area that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other parts of the body, and, in the worst condition, multiple organs and even deaths.
SARS-CoV2, which has the first component as a group, has many opportunities to treat adults with Comorbiditis as well as pregnant women.
It is not uncommon for people who are exposed to a high level of infection or to those who have an immune system to infection, have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average factor for SARS-CoV2 feeding is 1-14 days, many times 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 persons in WUhan.
However, studies of 1,099 people show that the incubation period was 3 days on an average and had a width of 0 to 24 days.
Recent studies, as described above, have shown that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on the knowledge of 8,866.
It is very important for health authorities to change the time of self - imprisonment based on the right method of screening, thus preventing infected but without symptoms from passing the virus on to others.
As is common practice, people who are exposed, or infected, need to shut down for 14 days.
Should the curfew be extended 24 days?
The fever is usually a major symptom of COVID-19, which may be incompatible with symptoms such as coughing, loss of breath, muscle pain, depression, headaches, sore throat, rhinorhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia in one ward after the onset of the disease.
In critical situations, patients rapidly developed severe respiratory disease, Septic rock, metabolic acidosis, and the coaglopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fevers, even if there are no unusual sights in the lung image, should be screened for the virus to have a first diagnosis.
A study of human information conducted at the end of December of 1919 showed a percentage of symptoms that identified 98% of fever, 76% of the cough, 55% of the dyspnea, and 3% of diarrhea; 8% needed to breathe with the aid of a machine.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family groups as well as in a group that is led to the adoption of symptoms without symptoms.
By comparison, a study of public knowledge in 2012 revealed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), a cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed to breathe with the aid of a machine, far more than the patients with COVID-19 and that corresponds to the highest rate of MESS murder than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (2%) and a painful throat (2%) were also noted for MESS patients.
For SARS patients, it was shown that fevers (99% 100%), a coughless cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40%42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and a painful throat (13-25%) were major symptoms and machine-based breathing was necessary for about 14% of patients.
On February 14, the deaths from VIID-19 were 2% when the confirmed patients reached 66,5666 worldwide.
By comparison, the deaths caused by SARS in November 2002 are 10% of all registered cases 8,096.
With MESS, based on a research study of people in June 2012, the death was 37% of the confirmed 2,494 cases.
The first survey reported that the SARS-CoV2 was high in 6.47 with a level of confidence (CI) of 5.71-7.23, where the R0 of SARS-CoV was from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV 2 with MESS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding their symptoms, deaths, and R0 has been recommended as Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CoV2 has a far higher capacity than MESS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has less lethal power than both.
Therefore, it is far more difficult to control the SARS-CoV 2 epidemic than the MESS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The opening of a procession usually takes place in the same family or at a similar assembly or in the form of a travel vessel.
Patients usually have a history of visiting or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients in two weeks earlier.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and that abandoned patients who have been discharged from the hospital can residually carry the virus again, giving the warning to increase the time of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells perperal (especially lymphocytes) in early stages.
For example, lymphopenia has a number of white blood cells called < 4×109/L that includes the lymphocyte number <1109/L, as well as the high levels of as aparate aminotransferrasase and aviremia found in 1,099 with COVID-19.
The liver and muscle levels and myoglobin were high in the blood of other patients, and C-active protein and erythropoietin were high in the blood of many patients.
For patients with severe illnesses, D-dimmer's level, the production of fibriin’s decomposition in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes had greatly decreased.
An unusual find was in the chest radiography of many patients with COVID-19 and with characteristics of twin-size spiders or pulmonary glasity on the lungs.
Patients usually suffer from unusual pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiration disorder (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, the growth of fluid, and progressive fibrosis creates an adverse effect on the gas reactions.
I-Type and I-type pneucyte decreases the surfacant level and increases the pressure of the surface, thus reducing the lung capacity and increasing the risk of lung loss.
Therefore, the worst effects of radiography are usually similar to the most critical condition of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first tour analysis of COVID-19 showed the fall of pneumocytes, the formation of the hyyaline membrane, and the achieving of interstatic lymphocytes, as well as multicated synaptic cells in the lungs of the patient, which is associated with cyclic disorder and ADHD and similar to SAR and MESS patients.
The SARS-CoV2 discovery using reverse-trascriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a major risk factor for the COVID-19 test.
However, because of the high percentage of the wrong active risk, which may speed up the epidemic, medical appearances began to be used during a test (not only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation arose when SARS tests appeared.
Therefore, the combination of the history of disease, medical evidence, laboratory tests, and radiologic effects is essential and essential for effective tests.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang team described a strategy based on THE UNERLOCK to obtain SARS-CoV2, which obtains US-CoV2 artificial parts of the SARS-CoV2 in 20 × 10-18 mol/L to x 10-18 ml/L (10-100 copies of a cross-plantation) using a cross-stick for less than one hour without the need of a complex equipment.
Hopefully, a new approach will greatly improve empathy and benefits if it is confirmed in medical programs.
Because of lack of experience with new COV, doctors may primarily be able to provide support for COMID-19 patients, while trying various methods of treatment that have been used or promoted in the past to be treated by other CARS-CoVs-CoVs-CoV and other bacterial diseases (The Table2).
These treatments include modern treatment and possible antibiotics, emununosuppressants, steroids, plasma from healthy patients, Chinese drugs, and psychological help.
Even a suggestion is made to use plasma from healthy patients as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical firms compete to build a defense and antiviral goals.
SARS-CoV2 particularly attacks the lungs at the beginning and likely again, on a small scale, some parts of the body that indicate ACE2, such as the mastrointensum and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, incontinence and respiratory impairment pose a serious threat to patients and is a major cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential for reducing the symptoms and saving health and includes regular oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, oxygen installations, and air - conditioning being used to cause damage to the body to the severity of the disease.
Patients with critical respiratory symptoms should be based on the use of extracorporeal membrane on oxygen (ECMO), an improved surgical procedure used for cardiopulmonary therapy or life - threatening cardiovascular failure.
In addition, keeping in the form of an electrolyte license, prevention and secondary shock therapy, as well as the protection of essential organs are also important to SARS-CoV2 patients.
The cytokine storm is known to be the result of the excess reaction of antibodies to SARS and MEORS.
The cytokine storm is a reaction method of the ectokining system with features of the release of the cytokines of the cytokines including TNF, IL-1, IL2, L-6, IFNName, AFNName, and MCP-1.
These cytokines encourage the immune system to release a large number of free though free drugs that are the main cause of ARVs and multiple organ failure.
Immune stress is essential to treatment of cytokine storms, especially for crucial patients.
Corticosteroids as well as toilizub, an anti-IL6 joint, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other treatment for the immune system of the cytokine involves the control of an immune reaction directed to a T cell; the prevention of IFN-ADD, L-1, and TNF; the hatred of JAK; bunnatumomob; the stresser for the use of the cytokine wheel 4; and HDAC components.
Steroids, such as Immunununsuppressants, are widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the risk of inflammation.
However, steroids on a high level did not benefit from severe lung damage to SARS patients and COVID-19.
Rather, it may cause unpleasant side effects, especially vasular osteonerosis, which dramatically interferes with prognosis.
Nevertheless, a short program of corticosteroids in low levels to the middle have been recommended for careful use of COVID-19 patients who are seriously ill.
By the time of writing, no effective treatment had been established.
However, remdesivir transplant, nucleotide alog, was found practical for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug first developed by Gilead for treating Ebola and Marlburg viral infections.
Later, the remdesivir again indicated that it might prevent the RNA virus in the same strip that connects the MelS bacteria with SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided China a framework to conduct studies for SARS-CoV2 persons, and the results are closely watched.
In addition, bariitinb, interferon-ś, lapinavir/ritonavir, and Ribabilin have been raised as possible treatment for patients with critical respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other critical reactions may occur after a combination of lapinavir/ritonovir therapy.
The treatment of these and other medicines used in patients should be considered with care.
Plasma from healthy patients and immunologic construction
A blood collection of patients recovering from a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting a disease is more extensive than a long history.
In fact, healthy patients tend to have a high level of immunity against their blood disease.
The immune system is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight disease and other nondisposal substances in the body and is able to see different cells from disease and to render them inactive.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was converted to 10 patients in a crucial way.
Their symptoms were improved in 24 hours, which was accompanied by reduced inflammation and bacterial tumors as well as increased oxygen volume in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed to recommend that the procedure be widely used before any treatment can be improved.
Moreover, in view of the side effects of treatment, some of the negative effects associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can extremely encourage immune reactions and cause cytokines, which may be life- threatening.
The volume of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is great for patients to be treated in an emergency.
It is difficult to build and develop certain defenses too quickly to tackle a global epidemic.
As a result, it is very important and reasonable to distinguish B cells from healthy patients and to mark genetic codes that are active or that are processed in the defense of important immune systems.
In this way, we can increase immune production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
Its effects, however, are largely dependent on the combination of many different types of formulas based on the TCM theory.
Most of the working parts remain anonymous or unclear as it is difficult to pick up and confirm such better - working parts or combinations.
In the meantime, because of the lack of effective and direct treatment of COVID-19, TCM has become one of the most effective treatments for patients with minor symptoms than among those who are recovering from critical levels.
For example, Shufung Jie Du pills and Lian Hua Qing Wen were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
High rates of treatment for patients with CVID-19 were noted in many Chinese states who used TCM for their patients, including Gansu (6.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan 50%), while the province of Hubei, which used TCM for about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had a much lower rate of recovery.
However, this is a miscalculation as other contributing factors like the number and severity of patients should be included in reviews.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and her colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) alone with the combination WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time required for body temperature to recover, symptoms, and hospitalization was shorter in the WM+TCM group than only the WM group.
Most interesting, the extent of the severity of symptoms (from minor to crisis) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group only (7.4% compared with 46.2%) and deaths were much lower in the WM+TM class than in the WM group only (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, TCM function and safety still await well-controlled research at many levels and sites.
It may also be impressive to see that the method of actions is noted and is clarified that effective parts of the treatment for TCM or its combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmed as having a COVID-19 often have a high fear of a highly infectious and deadly disease, and persons confined to wards are more aggressive, lonely, and angry.
In addition, physical symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and coughing and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased stress and mental depression.
In the first phase of SARS, a number of psychological - related disorders involving chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, hyperactivity, delirium symptoms, brain attacks, and even suicide attempts were reported.
A follow-up of compulsory and closed communication, as part of a public health response to the improvement of COVID-19, may cause many people to feel anxiety and guilt about the consequences of infection, imprisonment, and exposure to family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be given to COMID-19 patients, people suspected of having them, people with whom they are connected, and the public needs.
Mental help should include the development of mental - health fields of various fields, clear communication with regular and accurate returns regarding the development of SARS-CoV 2 and treatment programs as well as the use of electrical therapy and programs to avoid close contact with others.
Practical goals are essential to break the chain of contact from animals to humans that may be exposed and are often consistent with antiviral therapy in the control of new viruses.
Efforts have been made to achieve goals based on S protocol in order to develop long-term and powerful immune systems and/or protection against SARS-CoV loss.
Self-controlled goals have been examined in animals in regard to SARS.
However, the workings of these life - forms are the goals of adults as well as the death - dealing models and their protection from the virus from animals to humans before medical research can be established.
This is because the SARS was quiet 17 years ago and no new disease has been reported since then.
On the other hand, sensitive conditions and the MelS groups continue to appear in the Middle East and spread in other regions as a result of the persistence of bacterial sources from animals to humans in disease areas.
Prevention strategies have been designed for MESS to use a nonbacterial virus, DNA plasma, virus agents, nanoparicles, bacterials, and synthetic units of protein and some have been tested in animal models.
The building of a safe and effective goal opposite SARS-CoV2 in connection with persons involved is an urgent and essential task in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to cope with difficulties because of the long period (an average of 18 months) needed to build a goal and changing forms of CV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full medical program for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover less from the effects of previous disease.
However, like SARS and MESS, COVID-19 is also associated with the high rate of disease and death to patients with serious illness.
Therefore, building a model for the cause of the disease is essential for health care in such cases that its service services are initially set up, especially in areas with small help.
Based on the medical research reported so far, the following factors may be affected or linked to the cause of the COVID-19 patients (table:
Age: The age was the most important factor in the causes of SARS, which is also true in COVID-19.
The COVID-19 developed mainly at 30-65 years and 47.7% of those patients were more than 50 in a study of 8,866 as described above.
Patients who needed attention for severe conditions had a greater chance of being affected by other disorders and disorders and were significantly older than those with no age (66 compared with 51), suggesting that age is a contributing factor in the effect on patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Already present and complex diseases: CoVID-19 patients who need emergency care have a higher chance of experiencing severe heart attacks and artythmia.
Heart-related events again became a major cause of the deaths of SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV2 can also adhere to ACE2-popive chrysaucyte, which may lead to liver failure in patients suffering from COVID-19.
It is good to note that age and illness are already linked to strength and may interfere with one another.
A rare reaction of the laboratory: C-rective protein level (CRP) in the blood shows the risk of inflammation or muscle damage and has been raised that it is a factor that may be the cause of disease, reactions to treatment, and complete recovery.
The connection between the CRP level and the crucial cause of COVID-19.
In addition, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), apartate aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely shown in many organs, especially heart and liver, and are released during muscle damage.
As a result, they are common signs of heart failure or liver failure.
The major medical symptoms: chest radiography and short-term treatment symptoms should be considered together with other problems predicted outcomes and the complexity of COVID-19.
steroid use: As described above, Immunosuppressant steroids are often used as alternative therapy to reduce the risk of inflammation.
Since a high number of corticosteroids were widely used for patients with severe SARS, the majority of the survivors were suffering from vasculosular osteonesis with life defects and poor quality of life.
As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low and short time for COMID-19 patients.
Mental depression: As described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19 many patients suffered severe depression as they had to endure long periods of imprisonment and severe uncertainty and the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Mental counseling and long - term support are essential to help these patients recover from depression and return to normal health.
In accordance with the research of human knowledge so far, COVID-19 seems to contain epidemiological characteristics different from SARS.
In addition to repeating the lower respiratory passage, SARS-CoV2 can easily multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause little or no symptoms in the first stage of infection, much the same as the CVs cause common colds.
Therefore, patients who have been involved in the first stage or during pregnancy can produce a large number of bacterial infections during daily activities, resulting in a greater difficulty in control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV infections were thought to occur when patients were very ill, while most infections did not occur in the first stage.
As a result, the outbreak of COVID-19 is more critical and more difficult to control than SARS.
There are many current efforts in China that include the Wuhan blocking and the surrounding cities and the continued closing of the whole population in the hope of hindering the transmission of SARS-CoV 2.
While these measures have severely damaged the economy and other parts of the world, the number of new cases is dwindling, marking a reduction in the rate of epidemics.
The most promising rate is that the revolution will end in March and the reduction phase will continue for 3-4 months.
Some experts are skeptical, however.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which seems to be more interconnected than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Londini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV2 may carry two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV2 was found in both the mid-turbinate tubes and the earlobes of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly discovered virus may be a double-speed category similar to the flu.
However, promising signals have come from China on the basis of the declining number of young people who are sick, which suggests that the present plans may be working.
It had been predicted at first that Ebola would hold a million people and half a million people dead.
However, as a result of strict ban and isolation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It may be possible, as in SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV2 may be weak and eventually eliminated or become a relatively healthy virus.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MEORS is given below (Unfa.55).
SARS-CoV2 is highly contagious by coughing or sneezes, and it is possible that direct contact with infectious agents.
The virus was again discovered in the wild, which presents a new chance of transmission from the wild to the mouth.
A recent study of some 83 patients reported that 41% of the patients may have been admitted to hospitals, including 17 patients who had previously been infected with other diseases and 40 health caregivers.
Hence, much caution should be exercised in order to protect individuals, especially those with health - care, welfare, family members, their friends, and even people standing next to the patient or the host.
The first line of protection that may be used to reduce the risk of transmission is wearing masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 masks respirator (range # 1860s) helps control the spread of bacteria.
Simultaneous masks prevent tiny lymph nodes from being exposed to air pressure and attaching to the face of objects, where they can be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (range #1860s) can prevent you from breathing 10 to 80 m, while only 5% of the fully passed varS-CoV2 have the same size as SARS-CoV-CoV in both about 85 m.
Since crystals can pass five surgical weeks, medical surgeons who work directly with patients must wear N95 masks (range # 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health - care surgeons have to wear well - balanced protective balloons to reduce contact with bacteria.
Microorganisms can invade the human eye.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV2 even though he was wearing N95 masks; the virus may have entered his body by entering his eyes and waking up.
Hence, health - care surgeons should also wear masks that cannot be shown or mirrors when working with patients.
In the general public in areas affected or affected, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with soaps that wash his hands more often than usual, try to sit in the house to shut and quickly communicate with those who may be approachable.
The third point is considered to be the ideal distance for people to get away from patients.
These measures are practical ways to reduce the risk of infection and to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV2 came as a new virus in the world of mankind, its status of SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 was to be a warning to China because it still remembered the SARS outbreak in 2003.
Until 19 January 2020, however, the director of the Center of Disease Control in WUhan convinced residents that the new virus has little contagious and can produce a small receptivity when it is passed from one person to another and that it is no problem to prevent and control disease.
This message kept the public safe, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and they missed the crucial time to control the virus before it was discovered in Wuhan.
Chinese disease control guides can learn from this critical lesson and make important progress in the future.
For example, these diplomats should (1) be more careful when making public declarations as each term is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) feel and respond more to unusual information from the clinic than to the prescribed reports from doctors or officials; (3) avoid more to control what may be traumatic in the first place than to try to comfort the public; and (4) to make more frequent and effective public care services so as to promote community control of infectious diseases and to improve the quality of the community's response and routine.
OVID-19 outbreaks caused by the new SARS-CoV2 virus at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world when this is written.
Since the virus is much like SARS-CoV and the symptoms are the same between COVID-19 and SARS, the recovery of COVID-19 has created a feeling that SARS is repeating.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is vital to control the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more people who are older and more male than women, and the risk and mortality rate is higher for adults than for young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared with 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they do not have symptoms while the SARS patients transmit it when they are very ill, causing an even greater problem with the increase in COVID-19 than in SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV 2 is increasing faster and more rapidly than SARS-CoV.
The general assessment of SARS-CoV2 RNA may be very severe to some COMID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated may also be more susceptible to infections.
This discovery greatly increases the risk of infection infection infection.
With the rapid progress of the COVID-19 research, there remain a few critical problems that need to be solved, including:
Where does SARS-CoV 2 come from?
Although it found that 96% of the gene structure between SARS-CoV 2 and two SARS bats, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV2 is emerging from bats.
What creature was in the center that passed the virus from the first pond, say bats, to humans?
If we don't know the answers#1 and 2, we can't successfully cross the transfer, and turning can be worse at any time.
Although the molecular models and biochemic analysis have shown that SARS-CoV2 adheres to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the respiratory cells and cause the resulting changes?
Is the virus attached to the cells that show ACE2 to other parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve immediate and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How do the genes of the virus change during human contact?
Will it turn out to be a global plague, will it end up as SARS or will it be as bad from time to time as the flu?
It is important but may take some time to find the answers to the above questions and many more.
Regardless of the cost, however, we have no choice other than to prevent the epidemic as quickly as possible and to restore our health to normal.
Sources of bacteria from animals to humans of the coronavirus population
The change and flexibility have encouraged the co-evolution (CoVs) and its liquid, which include people, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two HCoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause small cases, such as common colds.
The outbreak of eclipse respiration syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiration syndrome (IERS) has changed the situation to show how much damage HCOV disease can cause and how much life threatening.
The appearance of SARS-CoV 2 in central China at the end of 1920 again set us up on the show and surprised us with a high interest but with a reduced parathogenicity compared with her sister SARS-CoV.
HCOV is zoosis, and understanding the roots of HCOV’s zoological roots can help us.
Most HCOVs appear from bats and do not cause disease from them.
The middle-level HCoVs are also known.
Coordination of animal ignorants has a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.
Research on the behavior of the CV whale in animals may reveal an important understanding of the makeup of the CoV in humans.
In this review, it provides a summary of the already available information about the seven HCOVs, and it will focus on the history of their discovery and their zoological origins and interconnection.
More important, we compare and divide different HCoVs according to the theory of bacterial and genetic mutations.
The currentCoV epidemic of 1919 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful vacancy and the effects of bacterial inequity in the severity of the disease are also being highlighted.
Cornaviruss (CoVs) are part of the Coronavidae family, made up of a bacterial group that is closed, with an obscenities, with a single RNA.
These bacteria contain the largest geometry from 26 to 32 kilobases between the RNA bacteria called "CoVs" because of their murphic - like crown under the electron microscope.
In principle, Corvs with no geometrys have the same order.
About three quarters of the geometry have two large floating frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), translated into replipse polyproteins of p1a and p1ab.
The polyproteins were further refined to form 16 more unbuilt proteins, called pip1 ~16.
The remaining portion of the geometry contains oF proteins, including spike (S), volume (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of table proteins also has a code of different CV columns.
Based on the sequence of proteins, CoVs are classified in four categories (alpha-CoV, beta-CV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-CoV field contains a number of HCOVs and divided into four categories (A, B, C, C and D).
The evidence of phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and mice are the source of alpha-CoV genes and beta-CVs, while birds are the source of gamma Cov and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have progressively passed the limits of species and most of them have become pathogens essential to humans.
Until now, seven people (HCOVs) are known.
Among them HCoV29E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five positives include HC43, HCV-HKU1, respiration syndrome (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory disorder (MYS-COV) and SARS-CoV2.
HCoV29E, HCoV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause minor symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SASS-CoV, MESS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 recently discovered cause serious disease, causing a serious respiratory respiratory disorder in a large number of patients that causes a high chance of recovery from respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and other diseases that occur outside the lungs.
The first form of HCoV29E, B814, was divided from the noses of ordinary cold patients in the mid-60s.
Since then, more information has been obtained on various HCoV229E research and HCV-OC43, both of which are responsible for immediate symptoms.
In fact, the view was adopted that HCOV is usually harmless until SARS emerged.
SARS outbreaks in 2003 is one of the sadest in modern history, causing more than 8,000 cases of illness and about 10% of deaths.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, which occurs occasionally in other parts of the world.
The new HCoV of 1919 (1919-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV2, is the cause of the ongoing epidemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,20 and contributed to more than 91,000 people by March 3,20.
Alam has been crying and the earth should be ready for the coming SARS-CoV2 plague.
All seven HCOVs are the source of zootic from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
The majority of evidence supports the origin of all HCOV changes from bats, where bacteria adapt well to and do not cause illness but demonstrates a wide range of genes.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented serious medical, scientific, social, and cultural challenges in China and the world.
Tracking the origins of HCOVictics provides a framework of understanding of natural history, motivating forces and reproductive features of the jumping jumping off.
This can also guide or assist in considering the cause, central and production of SARS-CoV2 seals, which will have a significant impact on future transmission control.
In this review it provides a summary of the origins of zootics, interconnected organisms and HCVs.
Especially, we highlight and discuss the same unit that HCoV’s parent viruses often do not cause illness in their natural pool but cause illness after a variety of creatures and new swamps are connected.
We also reverse the HCoV revolution in which the increase in infections often occurs and the reduction of pathogenicity.
The effects of SARS-CoV 2 further are discussed in this context.
Animal Covs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first division of HCoV29E B814 from the noses of patients who had contracted the common cold, separate CVs were separated from a variety of indigenous animals, including galia, a mouse, a cow, a cow, a cat, and a dog.
Over the past decades, seven HCOVs have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCoVs respectively (page 1) may be beneficial and informative.
The first form of HCoV229E was divided into the respiratory system for upper respiratory patients in the year 1906, and was adopted to develop in the WWI 38 lung cells.
HCoV29E patients had symptoms of normal cold, including headaches, sneezes, cancers and throat, and fever and coughs were detected in 10,~20%.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 separated the organ of the tissue and the passage of the next series to the nervous system.
The medical aspects of HCoV-OC43 seem to be the same as those caused by HCoV229E, which were not distinguished by symptoms in the transmission of other respiratory infections such as influenza viruss such as A virus and rinoviruses.
HCoV229E and HCoV-OC43 are global, and it is often related during the winter season in good weather.
Usually, the incubation period for the two is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy people with HCoV229E are exposed to the common cold.
Only a few patients with stress - related antibodies showed up with an acute respiratory disorder.
SARS, also known as "unique pneumonia", was the first recorded HCOV epidemic in human history and a factor behind SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first illness caused by SARS can be traced to the end of 2002 in China’s Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic led to a report of 8,096 cases and 774 deaths, spread to many countries and continents.
With the exception of the main operators, it was estimated that each event could cause at least two more accidents, during the four to 7 days incubation period and that the rise in the virus volume appeared on the 10th day of the illness.
SARS-CoV patients initially seemed to suffer from dyalgia, headaches, fever, Malaye and flu, followed by dyspnea, coughing and respiratory stress as later symptoms.
lymphopenia, faulty liver muscle testing, and high creatine kinase are among the most common laboratory products because of SARS.
The spread of anal impact, the explosion of an epital cell, and the rise of macrophages is noted in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients need emergency care and oxygen installation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, many parts of the body that involve the tendonsel, the liver, and the kidneys can also be exposed to these critical conditions, often associated with the cytokine storm, which can cause death especially on patients who have immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung surgery of a relative of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, massive efforts have been made in connection with HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-monthly child in the Netherlands towards 2004.
At first it was found that it was grown in young children, older people, and patients with respiratory - related antibodies.
The discovery of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchioliitis is common in HCoV-NL63.
One independent study described the separation of the same virus from the liver of an eight - month - old boy who suffers from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was found in the Netherlands, it is, in fact, worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of normal respiratory infections, and its high incidence occurs in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obscruive radiation, also known as macrop.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old male who was admitted to a hospital with pneumonia and bronchiolitics in Hong Kong.
Aside from the common pneumonia and bronchiolitics, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic phaceration.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV29E and HCoV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing small respiratory infections.
All these HCoVs are found in the community and are generally less likely to change for more pathogenic diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons as in an unusual condition of the highly lethal HCoV-NL63 type, reported to cause acute respiratory disease in China.
Usually, the more HCoVs gain the ability to absorb easily and keep themselves in a constant state inside humans, the more they kill or become less pathogenic.
The MESS-CoV was first separated in 2012 from the patient's 60-year-old lung who suffered severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the guaranteed conditions from the Middle East are from the Middle East, affected conditions are spreading to local contacts reported from various European and Tunisia countries.
Another second outbreak took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed incidents.
The medical appearance of MESS is similar to that of SARS, characterized by an advanced serious pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MEORS patients suffered severe kidney failure, which is at present different from MEORS among HCOV - related diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastroinstinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases of laboratory deaths with 34.4% high risk factors, making MESS-CoV one of the most dangerous bacteria in the population.
From mid- December 2019 to its end, many patients with pneumonia known as SARS-CoV2 were diagnosed in Wuhan, Huei Province, China.
The World Health Organization called the outbreak of SARS-CoV2 respiratory disease that should afflict the World's World Health Organization and named the disease COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, it was reported that there were 90,053 persons diagnosed worldwide, and 3.4% death rates.
Significantly, the death toll in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the other outside is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV2 causes severe respiratory conditions such as SARS-CoV and MEORS-CoV, which are introduced as fever, coughing, and dyspnea.
Sufferers are also affected by diarrhea.
The pneumonia is one of the most critical symptoms and can quickly develop into a system of respiratory stress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 are almost identical because of the same high order of nucleotide as 82%, there are different groups in the branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV2 seems to be a small panhogenic but more interconnected than SARS-CoV and MEORS-CoV.
It is reported that there are people without symptoms with SARS-CoV2 and that they may be a contributing factor in its rapid spread worldwide.
A comparison and division of SARS-CoV 2 and six other HCOVs constitutes a more interesting difference.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV progress is very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV 2 follows the normal rent of six other HCOVs.
Secondly, the criticalness of the COVID-19 signals is between SARS-CoV and four HCoVs discovered in the community (HCoV229E, HCoV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV 2 indicates common symptoms during HCV infections, which include lack of clear symptoms, minor symptoms or absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a minimum set of COVID-19 emergency conditions can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV disease, although the average level is slightly lower.
Thirdly, SARS-CoV2 connections also show interesting carpets with both HCOV and SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV 2 transfer is as high as the HCoVs received in public.
On the other hand, it will still be certain that SARS-CoV 2 transfers are reduced to individuals as in the SARS-CoV and MEORS-CoV status.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV2 can be found in the wild samples.
Whether SARS-CoV 2 is playing a vital role when it comes to SARS-CoV under certain conditions will still be discussed by future research.
It is also of great interest to see whether SARS-CoV2 will indicate an appearance at certain seasons of the year as well as the HCOVs found in the community.
Nevertheless, the SARS-CoV2 features that include its contagious, passing, and sustainable spread after passing to the people will affect the final conclusion of the continue recovery of COVID-19.
All HCoVs found in the community cause minor symptoms and adapt well to people.
According to one view, it may also be true that people are well acquainted with these four HCOVs.
In other words, both might have survived the ancient HCoV plague.
HCoVs cause serious diseases in people and people with serious HCoV diseases are no longer there.
For this to happen, HCoVs must repeat to the people enough to allow the growth of changes that are counter-to-digestional.
In this way, if SARS-CoV 2 outbreaks persist and joins more people, it will be more likely that they will become more friendly.
If he adapts so well, his participation can be difficult to prevent by closing the door or some other means of getting in the way.
For many years, four KoVs have been found in the community around the public, causing a common flu among people with proper immune response.
These microbes do not need a biological resource.
On the contrary, the SARS-CoV and the IMS-CoV of the pathogenic are no longer well suited to people and their internal contact cannot be maintained.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow in their zoological source and seek an opportunity to pass on to the victims that can be exposed, with almost one or more liquid and growing the ignorant.
SARS-CoV2 has features similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCOVs found in the community.
It is as highly susceptible as HCoVs found in the community, at least the first creature.
However, latogenic is more than HCoVs found in the community and has less pathogenic in SARS-CoV or MEORS-CoV.
It is still to be seen whether it will become fully adaptable to humans and rotate around without the source or world of within the animal’s center.
Before discussing the origin of HCOV animals, it will help us to discuss the descriptions and characteristics of the random changes, natural, the source, the middle - raising HCVs.
An animal becomes the HCoV revolution when it supports a closely related cork relative to its neighbor with the homology that is high in the order of nucleotide.
Coral bacteria tend to adapt well and do not cause illness in the eagle.
Similarly, a source of liquids continuously harbors HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the innocent are naturally infected and are not natural HCoV’s or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV is reintroduced to the water in the middle or toward the introduction of humans, it is well suited to the new gouger and often causes illness.
This medium scheme may be a source of zoological transmission and may play a role in raising the whale that allows the virus to multiply for a brief period and to be transmitted to the people so that it can develop the human infection rate.
HCoV can cope with the last exposure if it is able to maintain its introduced flow within the central stream.
On the contrary, HCoVs are able to adjust themselves to a medium drink and even develop a long term of depression.
In this case, the centralized gouger becomes a natural source of water.
The data of epidemiological evidence showed that in later times a SARS patient had a history of contact with hunted animals.
The subsequent studys showed that animal dealers had an IgG against SARS-CoV as high as the average population.
Masked palm civets (papagoma larvata) and racoon dog in live animals ’ markets were found to carry germs like SARS-CoV that resemble SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS was reported after the murder of all the cigarettes in the market.
However, it has been reported that unexplods in the wild or on the open fields of living animals have been contaminated in SARS-CoV, which suggests that masted palm civets may be a central breeding agent but not a natural source of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy, that 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV defenses, we cannot ignore the possibility that many mammals are not ignorant of the development of SARS-CoV centrers.
All these appear to be the last surprise of SASS-CoV.
A subsequent study of this natural dolphin, SARS-CoV, produced a close link to a bat, called SARS-related Rhinophus Bat HKU3 (SARSr-R-BatCK3), which is found in Chinese horseshoes.
These flies are very aggressive when it comes to the immune system against SARS-CoV and the sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCK3 genes.
This together with other batnel Corvs corresponding 88-92% of the logical sequence and SARS-CoV.
These studies have led to the development of the new theory that bats are destroying new man’spagens.
CoVs like SARS (SL-CoVs) are marked on bats, but they are not except for the one called WIV1 that can be classified as a living virus.
The public is known as SARS-CoV.
The WIV1 taken from the detergent samples of bats was shown to be using bats, civets and ACE2 people as a delivery agent for the cell.
Interestingly, the AIDS epidemic of healthy SARS was capable of killing WIV1.
Until now, the WIV1 represents the closely related ancestor SARS-CoV to bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence .
Although there is a high level between the two viruses, it is generally believed that VIV1 is not the nearby SARS-CoV parent virus and bats that contained the nearby SARS-CoV virus.
The analysis of phylogenic includes MERS-CoV and a group similar to the CV-HKU4 bat and the CV-HK 5 bat.
The Cov-HKU4 bat and the MEORS-CoV use the same diesel reactor, dipypypable 4 (DPP4), in bacterial entry.
The RNA-based RNA-CoV-based polymerase is closer to the phylogenecical forces of the beta-CoV bats received in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MEORS-CoV is found in bats.
The MESS-CoV and its close relative Corv-HKU25 of the bat share only 87% of the subsectional nucleotide.
As a result, bats may not be a nearby source of MEORS-CoV.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East has shown that camel camels are seropostive from the immune defense that kills MESS-CoV directly, similar to camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
The live-CoVlike human virus was separated from the camel's motor tube, which further showed that the camel is a true source of MEORS-CoV.
It is also remarkable that it was usually seen small symptoms but large discharges of the virus to the ERS-CoV transmitted by research.
It is noteworthy, that the nimble camels not only remove the bacteria through the respiratory tract but also through the mouth, which is also the principal channel of removal from bats.
The questions remain, however, since most MESS diseases do not have a history of communicating with camels before the early symptoms of the symptoms, it may be that contact from man to man or unknown contact routes involving the unknown animals that incubate MEORS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV2 shared the nucleotide comology 96.2% with the CV RaTG13 bat separated from the Rhinolopus affinis bat.
As is the case with SARS-CoV and MESS-CoV, the successive variations between SARS-CoV 2 and RaTG13 are too large to be assigned to parent relations.
That means, bats may have had a nearby sARS-CoV2 spring except for the discovery of almost identical bats.
It is thought, the ignorance of the sub-SARS-CoV2 animal should be among the wildlife sold and killed at the Huananman Seaped Whoolesala Market, most of which were associated with the first outbreak of COVID-19, which suggests that there may have been an event in contact from animal to man.
A few recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small mammals known as barilin (Manis javanica) may be incubating old basta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV2.
These new monolon CoV geometry counted 85-92% of the nuclear sequence and SARS-CoV2.
However, they are relatively closely related to RaTG13 by about 90% in the order of nucleotide.
They combine to form two subdivisions of nearly the SARS-CoV2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares the background of the attachment to a widely similar plant (RBD) and SARS-CoV2, with a sequence of amino acid.4%.
In sharp contrast, the SARS-CoV 2 RATG13 RBDs are very different, though there is a high degree of extensive geometry in the order of Homology.
Early research of sick lalolins reported the discovery of bacterial contigs in lung samples, which appears to be similar to SARS-CoV2.
The study used various forms of construction and hand-made planning to form a sequence of partial geometry made up of about 86.3% of the total length of the micromeme.
We cannot put aside the lalolin as one of the nearby nearby SARS-CoV 2.
In the meantime, however, there is no evidence to support the SARS-CoV2 as a direct origin of SARS-CoV 2 due to a series of sequences between SARS-CoV 2 and SARS-CoV 2 of a balloon related to beta-CoV.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV2 and RaTG13 is much shorter between SARS-CoV 2 and SARS-CoV2 in the equation related to the beta-CoV.
The SARS-CoV 2 evolution cycle for bats, glolins, and other mammals is still to be discovered.
Although high-ordered RBDs-CoV2 is found between SARS-CoV2 and Galalins, SARS-CoV2 related to beta-CoV 2, SARS-CoV 2 and RaTG13 share a high geometry sequence.
There are high charges that the high rate of similarity between the SARS-CoV2 RS-CoV2 circles related to the beta-CoV and SARS-CoV2 are driven by the choice of interconnectional changes.
One proposal recommends a reunification between SARS-CoV2 of a plane related to beta-CoV and RaTG13 on the third wild animal.
Like the force that actuates evolution, reunification is widespread among the beta-CoVs.
The conclusion has not yet been reached regarding the immediate cause of SARS-CoV2.
In addition to HCOV very high-paofic HCoV29E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCKU1 are also studied.
The evidence of phylogenetic has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV29E may have been introduced to bats, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in rats.
It is reported that the ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) discovered in a North American bat showed close contact with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV29E was genetically related to another bat’s Corv, called Hipposides/GanapomKam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while the calelids have been accused of being its nearest guide.
To clarify it, current knowledge about the origins of known HCOV animals is summarized in diagram 1 and Table 2.
The analysis of phylogenetics has provided evidence of HCOV links in history.
When HCoV-OC43 moved from one animal to man from domestic animals about 1890, a respiratory epidemic was recorded.
The record of HCoV229E collisions is not very clear.
The discovery of bat-CoV-Cov related HCoV29E.
Among them is the alpha-CoV of the alphaca.
Few evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First of all, humans and not alpacas are likely to communicate with bats in the same environment.
Instead, people are closer to the Altacas.
Secondly, bat-CoVs related to HCoV29E are different and do not cause disease in bats, whereas the alpaca's alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca has not yet been found in wildlife.
As a result, we will not overlook the possibility that the alpacas receive an alpha-CoV related HCoV29E from the people.
In fact, bats are a direct source of bacteria that can cause human infections that include theabilia virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may directly pass HCoV29E on to humans.
On the other hand, when the alpha-CoVs function as a collection of HCOV29E genes, the alpacas and dromedary camels may be a central agent that transmits the virus to humans, as is the case with MEORS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of intercommunisation between bats and the camel to humans.
The origin of the MelS-CoV evolution from bats is known for its first method and strengthened by the following findings.
Apparently, bats provide a host of microorganisms that offer opportunity to exchange parts of the genes between different animals and different species.
Long - term health, cramped colonies, close social intimacys, and the ability to fly all are ideal conditions for bats to become a good 'infecter of the virus'.
On the other hand, the MESS-CoV has been introduced to the dromedary camel for centuries.
It is well - suited to these camels to convert to a centralizer into a stable and a natural source of water.
MESS-CoV causes less disease and has lower flexibility in these animals.
Its access to humans is faulty and people remain the last layer of MEORS-CoV as its transfer cannot be maintained.
In contrast with the role of camels in the delivery of MESS-CoV, the role of laminates, if available, for SARS-CoV 2 delivery is different.
Particularly, the basta-CoVs of the barilin cause severe illness in the glolins.
They may be the last available system for the bast-CoVs-CoV2 related to SARS-CoV2, similar to Civets in SARS-CoV state.
SARS-CoV2 occasions between animals and humans should be considered or not in future research.
For one thing, bats may be a source of SARS-CoV2 that is about the same as SARS-CoV2.
People may play a similar role with bats by performing animal or coal drills.
Secondly, lalolins may be the growth snail in the middle where the SARS-CoV2 virus has recently been introduced.
People are being infected by surgery and by eating meat.
It is possible that many hunting animals including domestic animals can be exposed to SARS-CoV2.
A survey of animal and animal defenses is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the reunification and recognition of SARS-CoV2 may occur in the third animal connected with both bats and glolins.
The thought of the SARS-CoV2 origin is still going on.
Besides the various kinds of animal intelligence, there are three major factors on the side of the virus that are necessary to make the CoV crossing the boundaries of the species.
First, their high number of changes in RNA repeats.
Compared with other RNA viruses with a single letter, the average number of CV changes may be viewed as "less" in terms of the "higher" changes per year for each 2 units, depending on the level of the CV coordinates to the new memory.
CoVs have exoribuscleas for finding errors, being removed results in a higher change and loss of energy or ability to develop properly.
Interestingly, nucleotide hasalogue Remdesivir is known to suppress the recurrence of the COV by preventing this choribnucle and RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV2 attacks on medical research.
Nevertheless, the number of CV changes is about a million times higher than those that are not even aware.
In addition, the number of changes is often higher if the COV is not fully compatible with the submarine.
Compared with SARS-CoV with the high rate of change, the number of SARS-CoV 2 changes appears to be low, suggesting a high level of social coordination.
Supposedly, it may already have been fitted with another female who is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV 2, this is also practical for MESS-CoV, which fits well with the dromedary camels.
It is estimated that it is unlikely that genetic mutations can cause anti-SARS-CoV2 antibiotics to be effective.
Secondly, a large RNA from the CV uses more flexibility in the transformation and reuniting of the geometry, thus increasing the possibility of co-evolution, which is beneficial for the appearance of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by many different free reading frames and the use of protein that are produced, with the end of the termome.
Thirdly, permanent Covs change codes through the RNA repeat in a different way of "copying".
In a liquid that acts as a mixer, a type of change occurs regularly during the CV RNA transscript.
Too long homologous RNAs with full height and subgenomic may reunite to build new Corvs.
The biological evidence of natural reunification has been obtained from both HCV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and animal Corvs like the SL-CoV bat and batV-HKU9.
Microorganisms with gonorrhea
In addition to the three aspects of the above - mentioned virus, contact with the whale’s hostel is another major factor that has a direct effect on the integration of different creatures.
Here, the reunification of SARS-CoV is viewed as a regular example, which showed evidence of a critical choice during cases of interconnection.
Based on relative assessment between separated persons and SARS-CoVs of Civet, it is assumed that SARS-CoV is dealing with an immediate response to a situation that is very fast to different ignorances, especially with the changes in SBD on S protocol.
Usually, RBD in the S ProV protocol cooperates with the cell transfer and is carefully selected by the immune system's immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in 398 amino acids to 510 of the S1, which is attached to the ACE2 person and its coreceptors to enter the virus.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to identify ACE2 different animals, including bats, civets, rats, and raccoons, which allow the bacterial transmission of different species.
In fact, only 6 remains of amino acid marked as separate from the human virus and 4 of which are found in a motif which adheres to an ACE2 delivery.
SARS-Cov CIV has a K479N change and an S487T in its RBD, which may increase the level of contact between the spike protein and the ACE2 station.
In other words, this transformation of two amino acids may be essential to human transmission of the virus.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV2 has the same cell-sARS-CoV distribution.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV 2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit means that the level of SUV and ACE2 people may have changed.
In fact, an examination of the cloo-EM shows a higher rate of 10-to-20-one curves than between ACE2 people and SARS-CoV's protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether another creditor is required in the SARS-CoV 2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also attached to ACE2 but with a different S component.
There are other HCOV distributions, such as the aminopides N in HCoV29E, and the 9-O-acetylated salic acid of HCoV-OC43.
They may also be viewed as a reason for the success of the impact of the CoVs in humans after contact with different creatures from their animal intelligence.
In addition to cells, the effect of HCOV interconnected organisms is also controlled by dependence on another creature and the endometriosis.
The contrast between these protein proteins between humans and the ignorances that are not a natural source of HCOV as bats, dromedary camels, and rats may result in an influx of different species.
HCoVs should take the characteristics of being dependent on the owner and disrupt the characteristics of the whale's claw in order to have effective contact with creatures.
In this regard, cell resolutions in this vital area are yet to be identified and marked.
The extensive analysis of the geometry that is unanticipated by the application of current CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCOV outbreak: return to
The variety of bat Coves provides many opportunities for new HCOVs.
In this sense, bats have functioned as a collection of HCOV genes.
In addition, rapid changes and reuniting of genes continue the HCOV revolution and function as two important stages in the process.
For example, the discovery or loss of the genes that make up a new protein code is powerful enough to change the virus’s phenotypes dramatically.
Among the helper proteins in SARS-CoV, oF8 is thought to be important to socialize, since bats related to SARS-CoV are separated but found producing different OF8 proteins.
The characteristic of SARS-CoV removal of 29-nucleotides is found in the type of sub-counterised at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal separates theORF8 into oF8a and theORF8b and is thought to be a standard change which encourages the conversion of the innocent.
Besides, SARS-CoV may have a history of recognising with the list of spirits in alpha and gamma, where a large number of subgroups were obtained from the RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Reconnections were found in Sp9, for a large part of the Sp10, and in parts of the Sp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MESS-CoV epidemic has dealt with events of reuniting among the various categories, which took place in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CoV and MES-CoV, reunification events have been noted in some HCOVs, where HCOVs reunite other animal Corvs in their unprovoked genes.
It should also be recognized that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in insect geometry, which may result in the release of bacteria from the stress of choice used, such as those of the immune system.
An example of this results is the loss of the total length of the OF4 in the HCoV229E model, due to the removal of double nucleotide.
Although the complete oF4 was seen in bats and the camel related to HCoV29E, the Alpha-Cov alpaca's alpha-Coca indicates a single introducement of nucleotide, leading to a change of frames.
Finally, but importantly, the HCOV revolutions are retroduced by the pressure to choose from its shallows.
There were no signs or only small symptoms found when bats were exposed to CVs, indicating a similar link between the CVs and bats.
It seems that bats are well suited to the CoVs according to structure and function.
For example, reaction disorders that encourage inflammation in bats can easily reduce the built - in bacteria.
Besides, the function of the natural killer cell against bats is stressed because of the increase in the response of the normal immune system NKG2/CD94 and the low rate of exposure of cells of the complex hemosomatic cell.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-inflammatory (ROS) built up by a high - food processing job may affect both the pressure of the CoV and affect the testing of error with the endorobiclease, thus giving the pressure to select the choice of the most vulnerable species when they are introduced to a new category.
Highly effective litogenic forms may also change by reuniting, leading to the discovery of new proteins or protein features for refraction gases.
As a result, it is not just a surprise that three new HCOVs have developed in the last two decades.
CoVs do not cause any disease or cause minor symptoms to their main disadvantages, such as bats and camels.
They reappear without fostering a strong immune reaction.
Here are some secrets of why carriers who have no symptoms are identified and what causes people’s plight.
The most serious symptoms are due to the increased activity of the immune system and the cytokine storm when there is strong immune reactions, the damage to the lungs is greatly increased.
In contrast, for those who do not show symptoms, the immune response has been twice divided in the number of CV.
The same tactic of dividing immune reactions may have beneficial results in treatment against SARS-CoV2.
The interferon reaction is especially strong for bats.
As a result, the use of I interferon type for at least the first stages of SARS-CoV2 access to people should be beneficial.
In addition, the use of NLRP3 inflammasomes in bats is invalid.
In view of this assumption, NLRP3 inflamsome with MC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV2 follows the general SARS-CoV crisis and MEORS-CoV.
Although the beta-CoV of a bat shared by 95% of nucleotide homology and SARS-CoV, there is also an corvette Corv, which shares 96% of the Nucleotide homology and SARS-CoV 2.
Although civets and other animals in the market have been found to harbor germs like SARS-CoV, nearby sARS-CoV2 strangers have not been discovered.
The discovery of the basta-Calalins that have the same structure as SARS-CoV2, indicating that the lalolins may be some of the ignorant middle or beta-Cobarlins that may have a hand in the genetic component in the final SARS-CoV2 version.
While the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV2 is deliberately or incorrectly designed.
The CoVs are returned to the theater because of the recent SARS-CoV 2.
The study of CoVs and other animals has greatly influenced our view of the importance of the origin of zoological and HCV animal sources in contact with humans.
The widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, the MESS-CoV and SARS-CoV 2 have a origin of bat and is passed on by middle ignorant people.
Since SARS-CoV flows from contact between people and covets in the market, closing the markets of living animals and killing civets could end the SARS epidemic.
By the same reasoning, glolins should be removed from the biological markets to prevent the zoological flow, considering the discovery of many beta-CoV columns in the balloon closely related to SARS-CoV 2.
However, how and how SARS-CoV2 is passed to people in lalolins and other mammals will still be studied in future research.
On the other hand, MEORS-Cov has been around the dreadical camel for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as the main source of meat, honey, skin, and wool for the local people.
It is widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to kill all camels to control MEORS, as did China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV 2.
In order to prevent multiple MESS outbreaks, a more thorough method must be used to build effective goals against the MESS-CoV of the camel, along with other measures of controlling disease.
Since we cannot eliminate these bacteria, new genotypes may develop to cause outbreaks.
The variety of zootic Corvs rotates in the wilderness.
In particular, bat Coves have a vast variety of zootic energy.
There are many opportunities for these zoological COVs to change and reunite, resulting in new Corvs capable of interconnecting and/or killing people in the future.
The custom of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS conditions, the MEORS and the COVID-19, there should be a better plan for preparation and response.
In fact, many microbes have a longer history.
They live in their natural habitats until they have opportunity to leave.
Although fruit bats have many contributing factors to the spread of germs, contact with bats and other wild animals can be reduced if they are taught to live far away from them.
Continued conservation of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CV and its natural ignorances, which will be useful in preventing animal transmission from humans and future outbreaks.
At the end of this article, the best way to prevent the zonosis of bacteria is to keep people away from the natural source of zoological bacteria.
A few parts of the SARS-CoV2 genus cause puzzles are not yet found.
First, if bats pass the SARS-CoV2 virus to the monolins, it will be beneficial to see what conditions for bats and glolins can share with the environment.
Second, if bats play a key role in human contact, they should be identified by the way people communicate with bats.
Third, if a mammal acts as a true medium - size whale, the way it interacts with a variety of creatures that include humans, bats, and glolins should be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals as well as pets may be exposed to SARS-CoV2, both care and access to research should be done.
If it is a bat, a glolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV 2 or its parent viruses will be found in its natural fluid in the future.
Further research in this area will explain the path of SARS-CoV 2 evolution to animals, and the important results of the preventing and control of the COVID-19 people.
A review of the case of those who are "accounted" and "confirmed" with CIVID-19 requires
On February 6, 2020, our team had published a quick review and treatment for the new colonavirus in 1990 (2019-nCoV), and this issue provided our experience as well as the proper lightline for fighting this worldwide epidemic.
However, the 1920 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and understanding increase based on the ongoing research and experience of treatment procedures; hence, testing techniques and treatment continue to be continually ignored.
In this book, we have answered one comment concerning our journal and offered a new study item for those who are "accounted" and "confirmed" that they are sick according to Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new colonavirus of 1919 (1919-nCoV) had caused outbreaks, now officially called colonavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named respiratory disease 2 (SARS-CoV2).
In 11 March 2020, WHO referred to COVID-19 as a plague.
In order to fight the SARS-CoV2 transmission, our team has established a method of rapid response and has been printed on the Miriam Medical Research in 06 February 2020.
It has received much attention since it was printed.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, the awareness and awareness of it are increasing on the basis of findings and medical experience; hence, testing techniques and treatment continue to be rejected.
For example, the Dignosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http:/ww.hc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has published seven volumes in a significant way.
Our first interpreter received a comment from Zou et al., present a simple summary based on their experience.
Their work adds a new witness to our literature and made an important reference to this plague worldwide.
We appreciate their invaluable service and express our gratitude.
However, their performance needs to be reviewed in accordance with later finding out of Dignosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Secontrace 7 research).
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to ensure the diagnosis of a suspected illness requires that any one of the aspects of epidemiological history and two of the treatment displays be performed for a general analysis, or that it needs to meet three exercises that do not contain the clear history of epidemiological:
The history of epidemiological: (1) the history of visiting or living in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other societies where the COMID-19 reported earlier 14 days before the beginning of the symptoms; (2) the history of contact with persons affected by SARS-Cov2 (by the unacleic acid examination of fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and the environment); (3) the history of contact with the environment, or other communities where the COVID 19 days before the early symptoms are reported; (4) the history of meeting with many confirmed patients (125/2 of the most patients who have been exposed to the lower schools, such as children, such as at the schools, are in the hospital, and in the schools).
Medical appearances: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) which contain features of the introduction of COVID-19 passing; (3) the total number of white blood cells that indicate the normal, low, or low number of lymphocytes in the first paragraph.
The diagnosis of a confirmed disease should be based on the diagnosis of one of the following external evidences of Papogenic or Baseological evidence: (1) the critical PCR of the real time of SARS-CoV 2; (2) the full flow of the oxygen that shows the highest level of the known coronavirus bacteria; (3) self-infecting of the presence of an Igm protection of IgGS-CoV2 and the immune body in the SAR-Complation process; or the correct transformation of the SGGV-SV 2 of the immune system from the SV, which is more than than the case of repositation.
We see that real time tests for nuclear acidPR are in the respiratory system or in the world’s blood samples (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
The discovery of the pathogenic blood sample for the world's four sets (27 January 2020) and 5 (8 February 2020); and the testoological evidence is included in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing research activity of researchers to locate a high - quality subsection of early tests, as well as respiratory samples that include the sample of blood, which increased the availability of different tissue, and supported the drawing of a specific immunologic effect on the established matter.
Besides, there is additional evidence to remind us that we are alert to patients with unusual symptoms and those without symptoms.
Hence, Zou etl pass chart. It should be repeated, since it refers to a person who has no medical symptoms as being "in a low risk".
The process of points also requires confirmation at work and in continued medical studies.
In conclusion, we hope that there is more evidence to come and we ask the disciples to observe.
In order to have a "consistent illness" as well as“ assured illness, ” we recommend that it be followed and followed by new international journals in their home.
Our host will also return our companion to offer help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths caused by COVID-19, the highest number of day
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed the five new deaths caused by COVID-19 that day.
This is the world’s highest rate of infection.
Since the previous day, the Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, the Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has reported that the reported number of cases of patients is 114 and 33 people who do not sit at home.
A total of 17 persons who died were recorded.
In an Internet news agency, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead include four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50.
Again he said that two were come out of Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a disaster in March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an Internet video announcement, the President of Bangladesh Obaidul Quader has said that public transportation will be closed for longer than that scheduled, until this coming Saturday.
This ban on public transport had begun on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of important goods -- for treatment, fuel and food -- is still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 disease in Bangladesh were on March 8, for two persons who returned from Italy with the wife of one of them.
On March 19, these three are already recovering.
The number of SARS-CoV2 cases exceeds one million worldwide.
On Thursday, the total population of SARS-CoV2 coronavirus exceeded 1 million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths were associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the colonavirus.
This happened on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first outbreak of colonavirus and Zambia had its first die of colonavirus.
North Korea has said, since Thursday, it is one of the few countries that are free of coronavirus disease.
The previous day, the World Health Organization has recorded a proven illness of 1,051,635, including 79,332 cases in less than 10 hours before a.m. according to the Central European European (800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of colonavirus have been recorded, associated with about 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports, quoting Johns Hopkins University data, that more than 1,000 US deaths occurred on Wednesday with the colonavirus transmission.
Worldwide, nations have proclaimed tough measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyenin, a city of Moscow, extended the city’s ban until May 1.
In the United States, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to be paid without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament has voted to expand the national emergency within 15 days; the vote is replaced by 215 votes, 10 votes, and one with a vote against this.
Saudi Arabia calculates the time to return from the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to continue all day; before, the time to return home was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to use the time to return home between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the province had issued its rule to stay at home until May 1.
Australia’s stores have reduced the likelihood of buying a small - room paper at each market.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian shopping network Wolweworths and Coles has reduced its borders to the sale of toilet paper so that a person can buy two packs and one pack at each store throughout the country, in order.
The ALDI again opens the end of one pack, on Monday.
These limits are locked as messages on exit, and the Facebook pages of this store.
The buyers have continued to buy their bulk because of the fear of COVID-19 if they should have to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woyeworths again caught up the purchase of toilet paper for those who were sent home to make one pack for each order.
These changes follow the front edge of the four-deckers for each purchase by Wolweworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in its March 8 news commission, reported that by the end of a set four-decker, "Many stores still lose goods about the hour of its import", and called the need "unequal"", while the ALDI, in its Facbook post on Tuesday, "uni".
"Selling "high" last week, according to a Wolweworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also doubled the number allowed to double the number last week.
In order to cope with dating, Coles ordered the largest wallets for the surgeons and announced the increase of the spraying, Oyeworths is an extra suit, while ALDI makes the packages of a set Wednesday to be available immediately.
Russell Zimmerman, senior director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that merchants try to raise a stock, but local council limits regarding truck - delivery times make things difficult.
He expects production costs to increase, as surgeons try to meet the demand, with a few fans.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the quick release of the store, some stores could not continue with the Wednesday peddling.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a marketing expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that shops fill a store every night.
Note that the small - room paper is a weight - weight product, leading to a low number of stores in terms of numbers, and, when completed, it leaves a large gap open, strengthening the feeling that it is venerated.
Coles and Wolyoworths have [the] view that if there were many things on the shelves, if a product like a small - house paper trucks and typewriters [soldiers] may be purchased and there are many, you would probably be able to reduce the fear of Russell Zimmman according to ABC News.
The manufacturer of the reproduced Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday and lost the stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Kleenex Tourit Stress, and Solaris Paper made Sorbonne, emphasized that they worked 24/7 to keep output available, according to the News.com.au report.
Domaiin.com, a home - sales website, reports that some house vendors offer free paper to the first person who is in trouble in Melbourne, where a few indulgences are held because the buyers have time off because of the long weekend of Lavour Day.
The Thursday version of NT News, Darwin’s daily printed newspaper, included an appendix with nine pages intended to be cut and used as a privacy paper.
The stores were initially hesitant about setting limits, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3 when they said they did not have programs to introduce credit limits.
Russell Zimmerman added that some products also have a high need, including masks, tassings, dried foods, soap and flour.
Similarly, except in Australia, on Sunday night the supermarket selling in the British Internet, Ocado was seen approaching the purchase of the Andres private paper so that there were two of the 12 trucks on board.
The World Health Organization calls COVID-19 a plague.
Thirdly, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV2 — plague.
"While the term "disease" refers to the extent of the disease being affected, not the way specific examples are serious, the WHO has shown concern for the need to conduct governments in taking action:"
All nations are still able to change the nature of the plague.
If nations investigate, explore, treat, separate, tracking, and acting with control of people's movements, says Tedros Adhanno Ghebreyesus, WHO Director of WHO.
We are deeply concerned about both the frightening and the difficult expansion and the alarming lack of movement.
"In the words of Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the plague "is not original."
"He said, according to the remarks made to CNN in February, "except the flu, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the beginning until it spreads around the world."
"Ghebreyesus has expressed the same view, saying "He has never seen a plague previously removed from the coronavirus."
"He continues," and "and's not checked forward to see a disaster which can be controlled at the same time."
The new epidemic situation follows WHO's January decision to call outbreaks a global crisis of public health emergency.
"The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who said, "the rest" will be worse."
Since Thursday, the Associated Press reports that there have been at least 176,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, leading over 4,600 dead.
The 1920-20 colonavirus epidemic is the ongoing plague of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the current respiratory system 2 (SARS-CoV2).
In December 2019, the eruption was declared a Concerned Public Health emergency on 30 January 2020, and it was considered an epidemic in 11 March 2020.
Since April 2020, 1,61 million accurate examples of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and borders, leading to 97,000 dead.
Some 364,000 people are mild.
The number of examples of extinctions has been estimated at 4% in China, while the globes range from 13.04% in Algeria to 1.8% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include heat, cough, and loss of breath.
Problems may include pneumonia and acute respiration disorder.
Exposure period often lasts five days, but it can take from two to fourteen.
There is no known cure or treatment that can conquer the virus.
The above - mentioned preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth during a cough, keeping a distance between you and others, and keeping a good watch and isolating yourself from people who suspect that they may be contagious.
Authorities around the world have already responded by setting limits on transportation, quarantine, transportation times, safety measures in the workplace, and land restrictions.
The plague has led to a serious global economic and social crisis, a shift or call for sports, religious, political, and cultural events, as well as a shortage of needed items that have been eliminated overnight.
Schools including vitiligos are banned worldwide or in 193 countries, which directly affect 99.4 percent of the majority of students worldwide.
Misconceptions about the virus have spread to the Internet, and there have been cases of racial discrimination and discrimination among Chinese peoples, as well as persons from the East and the tribal and regional features of Northern Asia, and others from remote communities with many examples of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in travel and totalization of large industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities of Wuhan, China (Hubei capital) reported a network of pneumonia examples with unknown roots in 31 December 2019, and the investigation was opened at the beginning of January 2020.
Many examples have been related to the Huanan Seafood Wholeise Market and so the virus is still due to having a biological origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak became known as SARS-CoV2, the first active virus that is closely related to bats' coronaviruses, consteraviruses in lalolin, and SARS-CoV. The first known person who indicated the symptoms was later diagnosed as having been ill on December 1, 2019, and that person never had a clear relationship with a large number of yetrkets.
In the first group of examples reported on December 2019, three sections were found connecting the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconventional report from the South China Morning Post noted that the pattern followed back in November 17, 2019, a 55-year-old man of the Hubei province, may be the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new examples are being reported on in China but growing in Italian, Iran, and South Korea, a number of new examples outside China and still pass the number of new Chinese examples for the first time.
There may be reports under examples, especially among those with distressing symptoms.
By 26 February, small cases had been reported among young people, who had 19 and less constitute 2.4% of the world's examples. The chief science counselor of the United Kingdom's, Patrick Valance, tested 60% of the British public will need to be accessible so that effucive herdum would be available.
Examples refer to the number of persons tested by the COVID-19, and their tests proving to be confirmed in accordance with the procedure of law.
Since March 23, no country has studied more than 3% of its population, and many countries had laws to avoid screening those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A survey published on 16 March found that in China, until 23 January, 86% of the COVID-19 exchange rate was not yet available, and this unwritten transmission is the basis for 79% of the cases listed.
Statistics published on 30 March estimated that Italian transmission numbers are much higher than reported examples.
The initial estimate of the light-driven birthrate (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that there may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
Those who cannot recover, the time from the formation of symptoms to death is between 6 days and 41, most common to 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths were designated as the cause of COVID-19.
In China, since February 5 out of 80% of the deaths were over 60, and 75% are already present with health problems including heart disease and diabetes. Official fatal rates of the COVID-19 frequently refer to dead people tested for a COVID procedure.
The true number of COVID-19 dead may be very large, since it does not include every person who dies without checking -iib. At home, in an adult home, etc.
Part of the data from Italy found that the number of extreme deaths during the epidemic exceeded the official estimate of death due to COVID in 4-5x.
"A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the mortality rate] is below the limit"", a statement corresponding to the netatal reading reports under the U.S.S.
The first death that took place outside China took place on February 1 of the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on February 14.
On February 28, apart from China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. There are several measures usually used to calculate the mortality rate.
These numbers vary from place to point, and are influenced by the magnitude of the diagnosis, the state of the medical care process, forms of treatment, time from beginning to outbreak, and social factors such as age, sex, and general health. Diath-to-case Ratio shows the number of the dead and divide them into the number of examples checked during a certain period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case Ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) since 10 April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, the ratio of death-to-catio fell from 17.3% (of those with symptoms from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.3% (for those with symptoms appearing in 1 February 2020). Other measures include Case factor rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people who have died from disease, and infection factor fatigue (IFR), which shows the percentage of infected cases (incR) who have died from the disease.
These figures do not depend on time and are followed by a number of individuals from coming in with a typical solution.
A number of academics have tried to count the numbers of people.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the general risk factor rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
A high rating of this rate is accompanied by the results of a COVID-19 survey in Germany, and a survey of statistics analyzing the results of CFR estimates.
WHO asserts that the plague can be controlled.
The exact stage and height of the explosion are uncertain and may vary from place to place.
"Miciej Boni of Penn State University said, "If left unchecked, contagious outbreaks begin to drop and begin to decrease when the disease fails to reach the survivors."
"But it is almost impossible to make a sound guess now concerning when that will be."
"The chief health adviser of the Chinese government Zhong Nanhan said "It is probably late by June" if all countries are able to move to follow the measures of WHO to prevent the spread of the virus.
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine spoke of SARS-CoV2 "SARs-Cov2" moving around, powerfully for a year or two".
"According to the Imperial College research conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be required" until the solution is found (by bathing 18 months or more)").
"U. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus" will easily disappear forever" may also "a year's disease, return annually."
The backwaters will depend on the strong defense of the flock and the rate of change
The COVID-19 symptoms may be indirect and persons affected may have no symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are heat (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The most common symptoms include fatigue, saliva and contractions in the chest (phlegm), loss of smell, loss of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, cold, vomiting, shemoptysis, diarrhea, or cynoosis. WHO has said that 1 in 6 persons is seriously ill and has a respiratory disorder.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list of symptoms of an emergency such as breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or depression, difficulty in getting up, and dark faces or lips; medical attention is encouraged when these symptoms are present. The progress of the disease is in this can lead to severe pneumonia, a risk of respiratory disease syndrome, soptics, and death.
Some of those who are infected may not have symptoms, have no medical symptoms, but their test results confirm the flow, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact with sealed ones must be alert and tied to ensure the absence of the disease.
China's estimates for those who have no ratio markers range from a few to 44%.
The usual period of warming (the period between exposure and exposure of symptoms) is a distance from one to 14 days; usually it is five days. To make an example of uncertainty, measuring half the people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and later down to 15%.
Some details of how disease spreads are still being discussed.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact with tiny droplets that develop when you cough, sneeze, or speak; when you have close contact between one and two feet [1 - 2 m] (3 to 6 g).
Research has found that uncovered coughs can lead the falls to a distance of up to 15 feet [4.5 m] (15 g) to 8.2 m.2 m (27 m).
Some promote that the virus may be transmitted by tiny droplets that linger long in the air, which can occur during speech. Breathing devices may also be built during breathing, including when speaking, although the virus does not normally travel in air.
Embryos can linger in the lips or noses of people nearby or can be absorbed into the lungs.
Other treatments, such as supplementation and cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory degeneration to swell and result in air loss.
It may also disappear when someone touches the infected area, including the skin, then touches the eyes, the nose, or the mouth.
Or there is concern that it may become more common, the danger they believe is low.
The Chinese government has denied the likelihood of SARS-CoV2 infection by touching the mouth after contacting the feces. The virus has an increased risk of infection within the first three days of outbreaks even though the outbreak may occur before and during the final stages of the disease.
People have been diagnosed with the virus for up to three days before signs of transmission can occur before the formation of key signals.
Only a few reports of instances with no proven indicator of the laboratory show, but unmarked transmission has been traced to other countries during subsequent contact checks.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it does not clearly explain how disease spreads, one person usually infects two or three others. The virus lives on for hours to days more than.
Directly, the virus has been found up to three days in plastics (polypropylene) and 304 in a tentles testel, one day onboards, until four hours in the pocket.
This, however, varies depending on the temperature and temperature. Family and other animals have become believers and have been found to have a COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, even though British gears have ordered man to clean his hands after touching animals, as after contacting areas that might be infected by infected people.
Seventeen respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2) is a new virus, which began to be isolated from three persons with pneumonia connected with the pattern of respiratory symptoms in WUhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-CoV2 virus occur in a way that is related to the nature of the coronaviruses. Without the human body, the virus dies with the hands of the home, as it melts its external defenses. SARS-CoV2 is associated with the first SARS-CoV.
This is because of the origin of the vapour from the animal.
Genetic research has revealed that the coronavirus naturally combines with the Betacoronavirus type, the subtypes of Sabecovirus (lineage B), both with tiny bits of bats.
It is similar to 96% throughout the unit of samples of other bats. (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is a single amino acid that differs from certain parts of the chemical structure between the glolins and those of the people.
All the comparison of elements to this day has found that it may be 92% of the same element between the connanvirus and SARS-CoV2, which is not enough to prove that the glolins are middle-keepers.
In some cases infections may be detected by seeing symptoms, although the certainty eventually comes by changing the transscript polymerase switch reaction (rT-PCR) of dialing on the index or CT image.
A study comparing PCR with CT in WUhan has raised the appeal that CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although its rise is less likely, since its majority of group images are in other measures of pneumonia and diseases.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology maintains that "CT should not be used for investigation or for the first method of checking COVID-19".
WHO has published a number of RNA protocols for SATS-CoV2, the first published on 17 January.
Tests use the recurrent repositories polymerase keyaction (RT-PCR).
Tests can be made either by breathing samples or by blood.
The results are often observed in a period of about a few hours and days.
This test is usually done by naso-soupgal samage, although the throat swab can also be used. The number of labs and companies improve natural practice, enabling to obtain antibodies.
Since April 6, 2020, not one of these has been outstanding as adequate to be authorized to be used everywhere.
In the U.S. a genetic test developed by Cellex has been authorized to use it in emergency situations only with licensed pages.
The characteristics of the icon in the graphs and /ormed tomography (CT) of people who display the symptoms include a symmetrical mark icons or patterns or a set of values and a set of parameters.
The Italian Radiological Society combines the netline database of the world to be discovered by verified model images.
As a result of an outbreak of other diseases, such as adenovvirus, photographs without PCR confirmation have an end in pointing to COVID-19.
China's major research has compared the results of CT and PCR and has shown that the image has a small degree of tone, very rapid and very sensitive, which raises considerations as a test tool in the case of the plague areas.
The supercolligences based on the physical connections were developed so that they could investigate the characteristics of the virus by both radiographs and CT.
Antiviral techniques include maintaining personal hygiene, washing your hands thoroughly, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing with a dry paper and putting a wash sheet directly in a pocket.
Those who may have been exposed are encouraged to wear a mask in public.
Measures of physical isolation are also encouraged to protect communication. Many governments have set limits or warn of unnecessary travel to or from lands affected by a plague.
Yet, the virus has reached a rate of widespread contamination in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is still transmitted within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how it is transmitted. Health operators who care for someone who is likely to be infected are encouraged to use a fixed care system, to watch out for contact, and to protect the eyes. Following the victims is an important way for health authorities to see the source of continued contact and stop the flow of communication.
Using space space from the State for this purpose has removed concerns about privacy, Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations are releasing a statement calling limits to this view.
There are now different cell phones installed or promoted for voluntary use, and since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen professional teams have worked on privacy solutions, such as the Bluetoth to install a user-related log.
Users can now get a message when they are connected to someone who has been tested and confirmed to have a COVID-19. There are a wandering misconceptions about ways to prevent transmission; for example, to clean the nose and mouundush does not work.
There is no solution for the COVID-19, though most organisations are working to build it.
Hand washing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least two seconds, especially when leaving the toilet or the thoughts appear dirty; before eating; and after chewing, coughing, or sneezing.
The reason for this is that apart from the human body, a virus is killed by home soap, for it explodes its protective balloon.
The CDC also encouraged the use of alcohol-based sanitizers and at least 60% of alcohol-cohol Volume if soap and water are not available at that time.
WHO urges people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Areas can be cleared of pollution with a few solutions (in one minute of exposure to the testicide), including 62–77% of ethanol, 50–100% of the sopropanol, 0.1% of the sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% of hydrogen peroxide, and 0.5% of the povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as ebalconium chloride and chrohexidine glucose, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if the example of COVID is suspected or confirmed in such locations as office or day care facilities, all places such as offices, toilets, public places, public equipment such as tables, contact screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM devices that patients have used, it must be killed by germs.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a broom or a dome when coughing, sneezing, or sneezing, and quickly discarding any moth.
Simultaneous masks are lifted off to those who may be contagious, since wearing masks puts the limit at a high level and the level of breathing drops out to speak, sneezes, and coughs.
WHO has issued guidelines regarding time and how to use masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Puting on a mask can reduce [people's] tendency to touch their faces, which is the greatest source of access without proper hand hygiene." Masks are also encouraged to be used by those who care for someone who may be ill.
WHO has encouraged that nonpatients can wear masks only if they are in high danger, such as those who care for a COMID-19 person, although they also agree that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to promote the use of masks by members of the community.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing cloth masks rather than using health services. China has specifically recommended that non-patient members use discarded health masks, especially when getting too close to one another's [1 m] or less.
Hong Kong encourages the use of a surgical mask when taking public transportation or sitting in flooded areas.
Health workers in Thailand encourage people to make masks in their homes and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia officially closed the doors to the public without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect himself and others.
The Austrian government insisted that everyone entering a restaurant should wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a government mask when in the community.
Taiwan, as it has been producing ten million masks a day since the middle of March flight, has asked city trains and bus passengers to wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made it compulsory to wear a facial mask whenever you go out, while at the same time it encourages yourself to build a mask at home for those who can afford the mask.
Facial masks have been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Sitting apart (also known as physical isolation) includes steps to control contact intended to minimize the spread of disease by reducing contact between people.
Roads include separating; travel boundaries; school blockages, workshops, stadiums, parks, and shopping centers.
Individuals can use privacy by staying at home, by getting pregnant, by avoiding crowded places, by greeting without contact, and by being physically isolated from others.
Many governments are now pressuring or promoting social dialing in those areas affected by the plague.
The high level of association promoted by the US government and health institutions was suddenly reduced to 250 persons (if there was no increase in COVID-19 in the area), placed 50 people, and later 10 persons.
On March 22, 2020, Germany officially closed a community gathering over two persons. The elderly and those with existing health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, respiratory, and immune system are faced with the risk of severe illness and problems and the CDC warned them to stay as far as possible in public areas with plague. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health branches began to use the term 'to isolate themselves physically' instead of that term 's isolation', so that it is apparent as to reduce physical contact at the same time that it is kept in contact with the same frequency, or in contact.
"Use of the term "Separating" and leading to the conclusion that people must be fully involved in staying apart, may encourage them to keep in touch with others in different ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines for sexual health that can be applied while the plague continues.
These include encouragement on having sex with a roommate alone, who is free of the virus or the symptoms of the virus.
Separating herself from home is what has been encouraged for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspect that they are likely to be infected.
Health - care providers have issued detailed instructions for separating themselves properly from home, and many governments have enforced or promoted the isolation of everyone living in affected areas.
The most difficult instructions for homekeeping have been passed on by those in high - risk gangs.
Those who may be exposed to someone with a COVID-19 and those who have recently visited the country or the most widely transmitted region were encouraged to shut down for 14 days from the time of the last exposure.
Tactics to control the plague to close or push, slow down, or slow down.
The ban is followed in the early stages of the plague and intent on searching and dividing the infected ones and that other control programs are introduced in order to prevent the disease from spreading to others.
If there is no possibility to prevent the spread of disease, efforts are in place to reduce the risk of infection: steps are taken to minimize the spread and reduce the impact of health - care and social work.
Between the two steps of closing and the reduction may be followed at the same time.
Stress requires very hard measures to reverse the epidemic by reducing the light birthrate to less than 1. Part of the control of the outbreak of infectious disease to try to reduce the height of the plague, known as a series of epidemics.
This reduces the risk that health services are found to be frustrated and provides more time for medicines and solutions to be developed.
Nonprescription that can control outbreaks includes steps to protect oneself, such as handwashing, wearing masks, covering them, closing them, community measures that are intended to be physically separated as covering schools and demanding public events; joining in encouraging the public to accept and hold a share in such such; and so on natural measures as cleaning the environment. The more stringive measures to prevent collisions were taken when the size of jumps became clear, such as closing out the cities completely, and restricting the laws that protect the visits.
Other countries have also taken different measures aimed at restricting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced public viewing and made neighborhood arrests, and it issued warnings about the movement of those affected.
Singapore has suffered financial support from those affected by it and has forced a high price on those who have failed to do so regularly.
Taiwan has raised an appearance production for weeks and has imposed a court case on drug trafficking. The U.S. model of Great Britain and the United States shows that reduction (respecting but not stopping the rise of the epidemic) and pressure (to slow the growth of the epidemic) presents significant challenges.
Basic reduction laws may reduce the serious need for health care by 2.3 and half, yet the end is hundreds of thousands of deaths and traumas of health programs.
The pressure may be better but needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to surround human society (or until the solution is found, if the solution comes first), since the exchange jumps quickly when the steps are relaxed.
Prolonged exposure to the threat of a plague creates social and economic costs.
There are no direct medications to fight COVID-19, but efforts to build them are on the way, including testing available drugs.
Taking drugs from stores, drinking liquids, and rest may help ease symptoms.
Dependence on weight, breathing therapy, constipation, and respiratory support may be necessary.
Using steroids may spell consequences.
Many of the factors authorized for the operation of other increasing diseases are examined for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
"The WHO has also issued that "some old and domestic remedies" can perform relief from these symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Developing energy and adapting health care in accordance with the need for the COVID-19 patients is raised by WHO as a crucial step toward response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO European regulatory of WHO have removed key hospital sets and health care providers by dismantling services in different categories, including placing on the web activities of the COVID-19 examinations, denying options where possible, selecting and separating the approved COVID-19 patients, and raising critical management powers by contracting the staff and increasing the number of respiratory aids and beds.
Opinions vary as to where the first example (called egg patient) came from.
The first famous example of a new colonavirus is returning to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Huei, China.
In a month or so, the number of colonavirus examples in Hubei gradually rose.
These have been closely connected with the Huanten Sead Whoolse Market, which once again sells living animals, and the theory that the virus came from another species; or, in other words, we have a genetic cause for being adopted from an animal. An unknown swarm of pneumonia was considered in 26 December and was treated by the physician Zhang Jing Ji Province Hospital, who reported to Wuhan Jiaanghan CDC on December 27.
"On 30 December, a team of physicians at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of "coronavirus like SARS".
The rioting doctors, including Li Wenling, disciplined the police by spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, were rebuked by his officers for sounding an alarm.
The Wuhan Unicipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and purchased it for WHO.
sufficient examples of unidentified pneumonia had been reported to the Wuhan health authorities to take off the investigation at the beginning of January. In the first phase of an explosion, the number of examples was repeated at least every seven and a half days.

According to WHO General Tedros Adhamun, the need for personal protection has increased by 100 times.
This demand has led to an increase in prices to 20 times the average price of buying and has been created for four to six months ’ delay of medical supplies.
It also created a worldwide need for private protection so that Who warned that this endangers medical personnel ’ claims.
In Australia, the plague has created a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The development of this has resulted in a shortage of bottle feed for children in some big stores that the Australian government was soon to close. Despite the high rate of the disease Covid-19 in North Italy and in the Wuhan region and the great need for subsequent food supplies, both areas have no major food shortage.
The steps of China and Italy against the acquisition and trafficking of the most important goods will be successful and preventing the anticipated shortage of food in Europe and North America
Northern Italy and its abundance of crops saw no great decline, but according to those representing the industry, the numbers may rise.
The absence of food rations was temporary even in the town of Wuhan, and in China, government officials have freed up live pig meats to protect the population’s nourishment.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require those who undergo fast surgery to gather emergency times.
The global economy was reported in China, according to news reports on 16 March 2020, China’s economy was seriously hit in the first two months of 2020 because of the government’s actions to stop the growth of this virus, which was purchased in stores by 20.5%

The prison in India has left tens of millions of street workers paid for a day without work. A study by the Angus Rei Institute found that 44% of Canada's homes had been affected by unemployment. Some 900,000 workers in Spain lost their jobs since the introduction of the world during March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million workers in France registered temporary resources and 1 million British workers registered a universal credit checke. The companies that may be half a million in Germany have taken the personnel to a limited social service plan called Kurzarbeit.
This short - term German project has also been adopted by France and Britain.
Caterpillaries and culture are remarkably fragile by the plague that disturbed the operation of organizations and employees and representatives around the world
Human and cultural organizations have tried to keep their programs, often sponsored by the government, open the doors to the public, and keep their employees and the community safe, as well as support the lawmen.
Then, in March 2020, worldwide at different rates, museums, librarys, clubs, and cultural sites were closed for an unlimited period of time, lots of bows and games were either removed or interrupted.
Some of the newest and most rapid degeneration of religious, sports, and other social functions, such as relatives and colleagues, were told, and technology and fashion communication programs were made.

The Ministry of Health in Iran announced the removal of fifth prayers in the areas affected by the plague and closed places of worship, while in Saudi Arabia there was restricted to fellow believers in the lands and inhabitants who could enter holy buildings in Mecca and Medina.
The plague has caused the biggest disturbance in sports programs worldwide since World War II.
Many large sports have been reduced or dropped entirely, including 1920 to 2020 UEFA Champions League, 2019 to 2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro for 2019 to 2020 NMA Season and 202020 NHLUson.
"This event has disturbed the 2020 Summer Olympic programs that had been planned to start toward the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the games would be planned for a period after 2020 but before the 2021 pattern".

Since the outbreak of COVID - 19, a high degree of prejudice, racism, and discrimination has been noted regarding people's origin of China and East Asia and against people from certain areas of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the district of Asia- Pacific, there have been cases of fear, suspicion and hostility.
February reports, when most patients were still within China's borders, noted feelings of racial discrimination expressed by various groups around the world that Chinese people deserve thisvirus or have received so-called compensation.
Some African countries have seen an increase in China's discontent.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei have reported exile for their homelands
There was support from both Chinese and personal chat rooms to those in areas surrounding the Virus.
Following the transition in some countries of this outbreak, Italians, the first country in Europe with the critical outbreak of Corvid-19, may face discrimination and discrimination.

The tests of repairy coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 and SARS-CoV2 virus include the methods for detecting the presence of viruses and those that see positive anti-bonids as a result if one is infected.
The presence of viruses in compartments is confirmed by RT-PCR which recognizes the presence of the coronavirus RNA.
This study is specially designed to examine the SARS-Cov2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or current diagnosis of disease.
An antibodies, asterology, can be used both for a person's medical examination or for the employment of a party.
A study of antibodys shows how many people have developed the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be reported or without any symptoms.
The exact number of deaths from this disease and the degree to which the general public can go can be determined by the outcome of the test.
Because of estimates, by March 2020, there were no countries that had no reliable statistics on the number of Virus transmissions in their communities.
By March 23, no country has studied more than 3 % of the people in its countries and there is a significant difference in the number of surveys done in various countries.
These differences may have a profound effect on reported deaths that may have exceeded the borders of certain countries.
With the use of re-time repositories transfer transfer to purgatory reaction, rt-PCR, this test can be done on respiratory recovery in various ways, including nasopathy zipb or spoutlem.
The results are usually observed between two and two hours.
RT-PCR tests with throat swabs can only have confidence in the first week of infection.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continues to grow in the lungs.
For people who have a second week of testing, some temporary metamorphosis can be removed from the depth of the smell catheter or by coughing the metabolic, sputum, can be used.
Some of the early PCR tests were developed in Berlin in January 2020 by using re-time translation specialisation service service in action, the only basis for the circulation of 250,000 cases by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a method of testing on 23 January 2020. The South Korean Company dedegenbiotech developed PCR-based SARSCOV2 kit on 28 January 2020.
"The "Egenic" similar to all the beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene available only to SARS-CoV2. In China, the BGI Group was one of the companies that gained access to the National Protocols Administration Administration of China by using the PC-based SARS-CV2. In the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, distributes 20-Nvel Corvirus, 2020-Nive Development-19, by means of the National Development of the Departments Development.
Three of the genetic test systems of older test methods resulted in a poor response to the regants of the CDC and a little research in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day that they succeeded in February 2020.
The two studys were not found reliable until February 28, 2020 and until that time when provincial and local checkpoints were allowed to begin a study.
This method of testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Action. The independent laboratory began to examine in early March 2020.
In March 5, 2020, LabCop proclaimed international discovery of the COVID-19 survey based on RT-PCR.
The Quest Dignotics similarly made a COVID-19 investigation of the date from 9 March 2020.
No statistics announced, collection and processing of specims should be done according to the CDC's requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 surveys were developed and produced the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
On 11 February 2020 this test was registered by the Federal Service for Survival in Health Care. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test version of COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnotics obtained a DD code of research within 3.5 hours and thereby allowed one device to do a 4128 test in 24 hours.
In March 2020, the FDA released the Abbot Laboratories permission of crucial times, the EU, to investigate the Abbott m2,000 policy, the FDA had already given the Hollogic, Lab Corp and Thermo Fisher Scientific permission.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheiid similarly received a EU with a FDA test type of testing that lasts about 45 minutes.
FDA has allowed a test type that uses an amhermal subcryc acid aflification strategy instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of cold and heat cycles, this type may provide results in postputation in five minutes and negative every 13 minutes.
Currently there are some 18,000 devices in the U.S. and Abbott is expecting to increase its efficiency so that there are 50,000 tests per day. A test using the monocloneal antibody that adheres to nucleopsid protein, Nprotein, nonvel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan in the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes such as influenza.
"A review of the March 2020 text concluded that "" chest radiographs are of little help in early stages and that the CT, computer tomography, may occur before the symptoms of the disease occur.
The normal CT factors include the Bilateral volcano regressors with peripheral, peripheral, ammetricand posterior radiation.
Subleumence, crazy paving and consoledation increase as the disease reverses it.
A survey comparing PCR with CT at WUhan on the site of the epidemic suggested that CT is more sensitive than the PCR but does not contain details, most of it is associated with other pneumonia and disease procedures.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radio urges "CT not to be used for the first analysis of COVID-19" according to March 2020, the CDC encourages the PCR on death."
Part of the immune reponour in disease is the production of antibodies including Igm and GG.
These can be used to check the occurrence of the disease since the last 7 days or more began the symptoms of disease, in order to indicate social integration and employment. Assays can be made up of major screening, CLTs, or point-of-caring, POCT.
The high rate of automated Systems in most medical research centers will be able to work with esys, but their availability will depend on the speed at which each one is produced.
With CLT, only one perpecimen of perperal blood is used normally, although separatians can be used for immune reactions.
With PCT, one blood specim is usually diagnosed by taking a closet of the skin.
In contrast to PCR methods, an escape route is not necessary before the essay. On 26 March 2020, the FDA launched the words of 29 coded words that reported this Agency as necessary and is now able to distribute their antibody testes.
On April 7, 2020, only one method of research permitted by the FDA under the supervision of emergency conditions. By the end of March 2020, the Euroimium Medical Laboratory Analysis and Epitome Dignotics obtained approval of its European testets which could be able to detect IgG and IggA antivirus against bloods.
The check capacity is a few hundred samples within an hour, so it is much faster than the inner PCR assy of the VALNA.
The existence of antibodies is usually tested after 14 days of infection. In April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody testts they had bought could be effectively useful.
"Hong Kong has a program in which suspects can stay at home, "" for the purpose of emergency conditions to give the patient a spleen tube", to breathe in, get back and get results after a short period of time. The British NHS announces that it starts a home - check program to removes the threat that the patient will be able to get his medical care or the need to clean up the person's transport if it is used. As for those who are informed of the diagnosis of COVID-19, the health officer is the one who takes the appropriate assistance to use".
In Germany, the National Association of Statistical Health Physicians spoke on 2 March, said that it contained some 12,000 tests per day on the blackout system and 10,700 studies were conducted the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance when a doctor calls out.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to include 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19 a survey of over-speed driving was given in many large cities.
Since March 26, 2020, a German survey score was not known, since only the correct results are reported.
"The first survey of the laboratory showed that from the week of the calendar 12/20,995, a total of at least 483,95 samples tested until it included the 12/2020 checks and the 33.491 samples (6.9%) in the survey confirmed SATS-CoV 2.7. Israel, researchers at the Technion and Ram Hosspital and their own and tested systems for the samples of 64 patients once, by including more samples and research only when the composite sample of the Windisification of the 2.2-sphere was called "Umpa" and "Ump" for "Us" 2.2" and "2" 2.2" "Tutil" was known as "2" for the case "2-day" and "2-day" "Usa".[21]
Since the building is still controlled by the BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, modeling shows that the Hubei examples would be high by 47% and the necessary cost of meeting closed could be doubled if the capacity to include a test did not be found at the time.
The Lieb of Wuhan is soon followed by the Huo-Yan cables in Shezen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities throughout China.
From March 4 2020 the total transfer of the day is an experiment of 50,000 tests per day. The opening, intricate drawings released by the Origami Assays are opened to enable them to examine more patients' samples from CVID19 to use only 93 assys. These simulations can work in small webs without the need for hydrologic reactors.
Since March, the lack and limited number of sharks has become the number of objects in surveys between the EU and the UK and the US.
This led to some writers ’ studying the policy systems to prepare samples involving burning samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free the more examined RNA elements. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now studying the number of their increased populations looking at Coronavirus each head than any other country, and they were walking on a good foot to raise a higher level for a larger population.
"This was a combination of a combination of a combination of the power power of the motor passing through, and the purchase of pop-scale mas-throupupumum in Group 42 and BGI (based on "Huo-Yan"" emergency destruction in China).
It is built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of directing tens of thousands of tests on the RT-PCR daily and the first in the world of this active level outside China.
Various research techniques for the different parts of the coronavirus elements were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose a German system for building chain pumps that were sent to poor countries without their own resources.
The German policy was published on 17 January 2020; a policy founded by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not found until 28 January, delayd by the research available in the U.S., the China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of laboratory tests at the beginning of outbreaks, and these countries and Australia were unable to build and issue facilities to meet the need and encourage health experts.
In contrast, experts say that the widespread discovery of studies in South Korea has reduced the spread of the new coronavirus.
The ability to absorb tests, especially on independent laboratorys, is developed over a period of years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for the use of screening methods as the best effective means of fueling the plague of COVID-19. The increased demand for screening for the extent of the spread of the virus caused a buildup of hundreds of thousands of workers in the U.S. private clubs, and the removal of babs and chemical reages became oppressive.
In March 2020 the Chinese reported problems with the accuracy of its check tanks.
"In the United States, CDC scans were found "typed")" the government removed law walls which had prevented private investigations. Spain purchased tickets from the Chinese company Shell Biotechnology Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results were not correct."
The company explained that the wrong results may be due to the judgment of collecting samples or the proper use of kitchen facilities.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would remove the kitchens to produce faulty results, and it will put in its own room different kitchens that have been cultivated for Zbigniew Bioasy.80% of the Czech Republic checks purchased in China produce faulty results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million checkpoints in China that were found to be wrong.
"Prime Minister Matovič recommended that they be rejected by installing the Danube. The Ateş Kara of Turkish Health Ministry said that Turkish checks were found to have "the highest number of errors" and was not "used." "UK ordered 3.5 million checks in China but at the beginning of April 2020 reported that they were not used."
A test followed by the arrest of those who were found to be tested on tests and followed by those who had made contact with persons who had shown evidence of SARS-CoV2 tests, and the results were confirmed as well.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vą, the first place of COVID-19 in Italy, headed a total of 3,400 persons, at least ten days away.
At least half of the people who went to the extremes on the tests did not have any symptoms, and all the examples that were found were locked up.
As the visits are completed, this removes completely new connections.
In keeping with the enthusiastic, inflammable visits, testing, and blocking, the 2020 plague of Coronavirus in Singapore has continued to be more milky than other developed countries, but without such severe restrictions as forcing closed restaurants and other commercial stores.
Many cases have been proposed, and Singapore began to advise citizens to stay at home on March 28, but schools opened in time after holiday on March 23.
A number of countries have also been able to care for the disaster with a wave of follow-ups, logging, inspection, and closing, but to a limited degree, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics have found that nations are more studied, in contrast with the numbers of the dead, have lower mortality rates, which may be due to reason that they are in a better position to investigate those who suffer from poverty or who have none at all.
WHO recommends that nations that have no access to surveys and national albums have limited experience with VIID-19 sending the first five and ten new reliable samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO's reliable Web pages to ensure research.
Among 16 reliable, 7 Asian, 5 European, 2 African, 1 North American and 1 Australian.
In the next chart, column "Certification" is affected by the global survey method.
A world that checks only people accepted in hospitals will have more guarantee of % of a survey than a country that checks all its citizens, whether they show signs or not, other things are the same.
Hand washing (or washing hands), you are also known as hand washing, hand washing with the purpose of removing soil, ice, small items, or unwanted forks.
Cleaning hands with soap without delay in those "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are related to the nervous system Truly.
People can also be exposed to respiratory diseases such as cold or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, the facts that still bother us).
The five critical periods during the day when soap - washing involves: before and after removing the eggs or changing the diapers, before feeding the baby, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or domestic birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization encourages hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the child using the toilet.
After a cough, a cough, or a sneeze.
After touching an animal, an animal’s diet, or an animal’s pollution.
Sanitation of the hands of the patient refers to sanitary practices that are associated with the medical process.
Cleaning the hands before offering medication or medical treatment can prevent or slow the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands by cleaning the hands of bacteria (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is of great importance to people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is an important procedure even to the common community.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the contagious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
to reduce the risk of infant mortality in the home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing may lead to less progress during children under five years of age.
In developing countries, young deaths related to respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple lifestyle changes, such as detergents.
Simple action can reduce the mortality rate with these diseases by about 50%.
Interventional methods that promote soap - washing can reduce diarrhea’s portions by three parts, and this can be compared to the cutting of clean water into poorer areas.
The reduction of hip fragments by 48% can be linked to the use of soaps and soaps. Soiling with soap is a useful and inexpensive method for protecting diarrhea and schistories (ARI), such as natural behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
And pneumonia, which is large ARI, leads alone as a cause of infant deaths under five years of age, loses an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia are both responsible for about 3.5 million infant deaths a year.
According to UNICEF, switching hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet to become a fixed routine can save more health than any single cure or medical intervention, it decides to die for at least half the cause of diarrhea and death by respiratory diseases in one half.
Hand washing is usually combined with other garbage transfers such as part of the water, sewage and sanitation (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against emphysema by direct contact.
A minor accident as a result of regular washing of the hands is a result of skin damage caused by dryness.
The Danish study of 2012 found that hand washing too much could result in bites, and a covered leather condition known as hand iczema or Hand dermatitis, which is the most common practice for non-work health workers.
Cleaning the hands is also seen as one of the most common behavior signals of OCD (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when soap washing is important to reduce the transmission of the disease by oral control: after using the toilet (suspending, rinsing), after cleaning the baby's limbs (consuming the diapers), before feeding, before eating or or after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or domestic birds.
Sometimes a proper hand - washing process must be followed to avoid passing the disease before and after handling the injury or injury; after coughing, coughing, or coughing; after touching an animal’s nose or handling animals; and after handling waste.
In many countries, there is a low rate of soap washing.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 1915 found that, on the average, 38.7% of families follow a soap - washing program. The 2014 survey showed that Saudi Arabia had a high rate of 97 percent; the United States near and within 7 percent; and China at a low rate of 23 percent. The few practices are now in promoting the practice of hand washing at special times.
The "E Essential Health Care Program" launched by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the act of encouraging the health and educational health of children.
Removal dislocating twice a year, coupled with frequent soaping, daily brushing with fluoride, is the key to the world's program.
It was successfully begun in Indonesia too.
Removing microorganism from the skin is better done with the use of soap or water cleaning.
The main function of soap and cleaning is to reduce the solutions, and increase soluty.
Water alone is not enough to wash the skin because the oil and the proteins, which form the soil, do not easily dissolve the water.
But cleaning helps the flow of water to the extent possible.
A pot of soap, since it is capable of repealing itself, may store the bacteria that remain in front of it.
A small amount of research into the transmission of the virus from the reactor of a contaminated present concludes that it is impossible to do so when bacteria are cleaned up and foamed.
The CDC continues to say that ‘ liquid soap and control without hands is better.
Gifts that eliminate germs are highly advertised by health - care members of the community.
To this day, there is no evidence that the use of suggested antisensics or disinfectants prefers natural antibiotic-resistants.
However, antibacterial soaps have common agents for antibacterials such as trilosans, which have a long list of organist movements.
Thus, even if the antibacle antibacterial antibiotics are not selected, they may not be able to function properly in the way they are sold.
Besides the surfacant and aurfacant, complex structures may contain acids (accetic acid, acorbic acid, anticcic acid) as a ruler of pH, antivially benocyic acid and other skin carers (aloe vera, an organ, annotol, plastics, plastics). An extensive analysis of the U.S.
Hot water with which you can wash your hands does not burn to the proper degree to kill bacteria.
Viruses grow greatly when the heat of the pit is (37 °C).
Yet, warm, soapy water works better than cold water, which contains soap to remove the natural oils that trap soil and bacteria.
Contrary to belief in multitudes, scientists have shown that using warm water does not contribute to reducing microbial lead.
The Hand santizer or anti-suptic is a representative of non-water cleaning hands.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, non-water-water cleaning agents (also known as alcohol-based rubs, antiptic black rubs, or handizers) began to gain popularity.
Many are based on the proppyl alcohol or ethanol that has been added to a heated agent such as Carbon (polymer of acrylic acid), or amucant as a glycerin, or foam, to make it easy to use and reduce a calculation of alcohol.
Immerated hydrogen-prexide raises the role of an antibacterial activity more efficiently. Sandnitizers have 60 to 95% alcohol - effectively kill bacteria.
Alcohol rub sanizers kill bacteria, multi-drug restitutional bacteria (MMSA and VRE), tubiculosis, and other microbes (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rSV, rvvirus, vinovirus, vicinia, enfluenza, and hepatitis).
Alcohol rubs with 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log less, similar to 35 decibel) bacteria in the hands in 30 seconds after anointing and 99.99% less than 99.99% (4 to 5 log) in the hands of bacteria in 10 minutes after anointing. Handnitizers operate fairly well on germs and operate less on certain microbes.
Nonrovirus (or Noral) types of bacteria, the main cause of interconnected gastateritis. The non-antizertic and alcohol rub must be used in order to soften completely or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the fluid, foam or stream is dry.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands rather than rubbing them with sandnizers, a lady when it is clear that the hands are clean.
The rise in the use of these symbols is due to their simple action and immediate ability to kill micro-organisms; however, they should be used to replace appropriate hands washing unless soap and water are not available.
Always using alcohol-based hanitzers can cause dry skin unless you are fitted with emontants and/ or skin creams in combination.
The alcohol - dry process can be reduced or eliminated by installing glycerins and/or alcohollints in combination.
In medical studies, harnitizers based on alcohol with almonds produce a milder and dry skin effect than soaps or amphibials.
Allergic contact dermatitis, joint rather thanricia syndrome or hyperactivity to alcohol wells or advisives that are present in alcohol hard rubs are rare.
The low position of causing the critant contact to be attractive when compared to washing your hands with soap and water.
Regardless of their effectiveness, unregulated advocates do not wash their hands from nature, but they simply kill germs.
This is because the hannds do not function properly as soap and water to prevent the spread of more and more pathogens, as the parathogens continue to be in the hands.
Success of non-alcohol can be attributed more to ingredients and combinations, and they are historically more embarrassing than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, the combination of ebononium chloride has shown the persistence and increase in the operation of an antichemical function after applied, in contrast with alcohol, which has been shown to reduce the effectiveness after repeated working, may be due to further skin reactions.
Many people in economically poor communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or soil in place.
The ash or soil may work better than water, but it works less than soap.
One concern is that when soil or ash receives micro-organism pollution, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also an antiviral agent because when mixed with water, a mixture of alkaline is formed.
WHO encourages ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
The proper hand - washing process recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for Prevention of Transmission of Disease includes these steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
Flowing water is encouraged because standing coconuts may be contaminated, whereas cold or hot water does not show the difference.
Wash your hands with proper soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap raises germs in the skin, and studies indicate that people usually clean their hands better when soap is available than when they use water.
Disconnect for at least 20 seconds.
Sugarcane produces heat, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and prolonged diarrhea removes more germs.
Clean well under running water.
Cleaning on a bed may defile the hands
Those who dry with a clean towel or allow it to dry with air.
Wet and mummified hands take away waste, which are easily forgotten by the thumb, event, space between the fingers, and under fingernails.
Nail polish nails can harbor microorganism.
A wet watch is often encouraged to keep your hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can raise the exposure of the disease.
A variety of inexpensive programs can be made to meet up with hand washing when water is piped and/or soap is not available. To pour water by hanging up a container or drum with appropriate holes and/ or using ash if required in developing countries. In low - water conditions (such as schools or rural areas in the developing world), there are also low - water - saving processes, such as "tippy-laps" and other types of saving.
The tap is a simple technique for using a rope-laid drum, and a foot whip that carries a little water into the hands and a bar of soap.
Manually dry dryness is an important part of the hand - washing process, but there is a disagreement about how best to dry dry in public cleaners.
An increasing level of research suggests that the paper towels are better clean than the air - conditioned dryer found in the laundry.
In 2008, a study directed by the University of Westminster, London, which was also supported by the European Tisue Sympium, to compare the sanitary levels found in paper towels, hot - air dryers, and fresh - air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with hot gas, the total number of bacteria was found to rise on average to the fingers by 1941 and at the hands of 254%.
The dryness of the rapid wind has succeeded in rising by a total amount of bacteria in the hands of 42% and in hand net 15%.
After cleaning up and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of the virus is dropped on average to 76% of the fingers and handprints by reaching 77%. Scientists once again took the chance of contact with the cleaner operators and cleaning as a result of each method of drying.
The fast-wind extinguisher, which detects the air from it at the 180 m/s set (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to ward off micro-organisms in the hand and to join some users and cleaning up to a distance of about 8 feet [2 m].
The use of hot air can spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 feet from dry.
Paper towels did not display significant micro-organisms. In 2005, a study directed by TśV Produtk und Ullt, different methods of drying were examined.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after handmasing were observed:
There are a lot of manual manufacturers present, and handmills have been compared to dried to hammers.
Cleaning hands with sanitics is another way to take a trip in soap and water.
An alcohol-built cannitzer should have as alcohol 60% at least.
Medical hand washing was long forced after a Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis obtained its work (1846) to protect the disease in the hospital area.
There are electrical operators who suffer with a note reminding hospital workers to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a reduction in disease levels through their function.
Medical hand washing takes 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or stream to anoint or rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed together by pressing the fingers.
If there is contamination under the nails, a blue shell can be used to remove it.
Since germs can stay in the water of your hands, it is important to clean and dry the soil with clean towels.
After drying, a sheet of paper should be used to fill the water (and open any exit door if possible).
This avoids repeated contamination of hands in those areas.
The intention of cleaning the hands in a state of care is to remove microorganisms ("germs") and avoid passing them on.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that letting go of hand washing continues at unacceptable levels in many medical areas, a large number of doctors and nurses continue to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus transfer microorganisms to them.
One study showed that hand washing by way of other simple processes can reduce the level of the catether-related blood transfusion in cases by 66 percent. The World Health Organization printed a sheet that shows the policy of hand washing and rubbing hands in the field of health care.
Organization’s updated instructions on hand can be found in the Web site for the public opinion.
The correct review was guided by Whitby etl.
Shopmarkets can measure and ensure hand hygiene if they are required to show and comply with the law.
The World Health Organization "has five times" hand washing:
after exposure to blood/ plasma
before the performance of the financial statements, and
and after the care of the patient. Applying detergents to a gift ("in medicine" or gifts "a microbes") empowers the kill in that hand washing.
That power of death may be required before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are plentiful. 'Arson' for the purpose of operating, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without hand contact, chloxidine or iodine wash, handwashsters towels after washing, and white sprush for cleaning and other testing equipment under the noses.
All jewelry must be removed.
The procedure requires cleaning the hands and arms to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
Long periods of pulling (10 minutes) are not needed.
When rubbing, the water in the arms must be stopped and not run back into the hands.
After the completion of washing the hands, the hands are dried with sterile cloth or the surgical gown is worn.
In order to reduce the spread of the virus, it is best to wash your hands or use hand antibiotics before and after tending to a patient.
In order to control scaphylococcus diseases in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from clean hands comes from 20% of the first to clean, and that there is very little more compensation available when repeated hand washing is raised than 35%.
Cleaning with pure soaps results in a three-size rate of infectious disease compared with cleaning with detergents. Contrasting the hand-rubbing with alcohol-based soil solution with the antibacterial atmosphere for a media of 30 weeks followed by the alcohol-d last-ductive circuit.
But soap and water do better than alcohol-based rubs in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clotridium cry in the hands. Interventure to improve hand hygiene in health care conditions may include training workers by hand washing, raising the availability of alcohol-based dand rubbs, and keeping and comments on workers.
There is a need for further research to investigate which methods of intervention work best in different health - care conditions.
In developing countries, soap - washing is recognized as a means of obtaining health benefits, an important instrument for achieving good health, even physical nutrition.
Yet, lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or hand washing facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces presents a challenge to the practices of hand washing the earth’s hands.
In many African villages, for example, hand washing taps and private toilets are missing, even though there are inexpensive methods to build hand - washing facilities.
However, low hand - washing levels may be the reason for more deeply ingrained habits than those of a lack of soap or water.
Displaying and representing soap - washing can also contribute to making legal decisions, promoting awareness of the benefits of hand washing and leading to a change of traditional life - styles.
For this to be effective, caution and follow along is vital.
A review of some 70 studies found that social programs are useful in promoting hand washing in the LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One example of advertising in schools is UNICEF's "The Three Starway" of which encourages schools to take simple, protective steps to ensure that students clean their hands with soap, among other requirements of hygiene.
When small levels are reached, schools can move from one to another and eventually go to three stars.
Creating hand washing can be part of a hand - cleaning campaign in an effort to minimize disease and infant mortality.
World Day for Cleaning the Hands is one of the examples of vigilant effort in trying to achieve a change in habits. As a result of the 2010-20 epidemic of colonavirus, UNICEF declared the widespread use of the automation engine.
A few studies have considered the total cost of hand washing in developing countries and cooperation and the prevention of DALYs.
One review, however, raises the point that advertising soaps save more expense than other flooding and cleaning.
The importance of cleaning one’s hands in a person’s health – especially in people under the most delicate conditions such as the mother or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first observed in the mid - 19th century by two hand cleaners: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English "The founder of modern medicine."
At that time many people still believed that disease was caused by bad odors called maasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks from diet and medical - related diseases led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand washing as an important way to prevent the spread of disease.
The outbreak of the flu in 2009 and the plague of COVID-19 in20 led to a high awareness in many countries regarding the importance of soap washing to protect oneself from this type of infectious disease.
For example, posters with the label "the proper hand washing process" are hung up near a washroom in public toilets and private rooms at the offices and airports in Germany.
The saying "Cleansing your hands" means clearing someone who does not want to take responsibility for something or to be involved in it.
Its origin is part of the Bible in Matthew when Pontius Pilate cleanses himself in making a decision to impale Jesus Christ, but it has become a very general term in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth's Macbere, Mrs. Macbeth begins to force us by washing our hands in an attempt to cleanse ourselves of supposed uncleanness, which represents a guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and persuaded her husband to do.
It was also found that people, after either remembering or thinking about the wrong actions, are more likely to wash their hands more frequently than others, and they tend to appreciate the value of handwashing.
Moreover, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward, they are less likely to participate in “cleaning ” acts, such as volunteerism.
Religion encourages hand washing with both the purpose of hygiene and the symbolic. A typical symbol for washing hands, using water but without soap to clean hands, is part of a system of hand washing of many religions, including Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and untilat diamonds in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu to Islam. Religions also encourage hand washing, especially after certain practices.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam force hand washing after using a toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force the washing of hands before and after meals.
COVID-19 Work Area Management
Risk management in the workplace of COVID-19 is the use of Occupational safety and Halth operations to protect the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The proper management of an accident in the workplace depends on the work environment and the type of activity, based on testing the risk of exposure sources, the difficulty of the disease in the community, and the hazards to individual workers who may be weak in preventing COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low - risk occupation services have a lower rate of social contact with other employees, which means that simple precautions are encouraged, including hand washing, homekeeping, air - conditioning behavior, and maintenance procedures in the workplace.
Activities that can be exposed to internal risk include those that require regular and close contact with people unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but they may be infected because of ongoing social transmission or international travel.
This includes employees who can contact the common community as schools, overcrowded jobs, and crowded trading conditions.
The risk controls in this group, in addition to simple immune measures, include protection using high-efcientious airfills, sneezze guards, and a personal protocol available in cases where a OVID-19 person is found.
The Osha views health and cold personnel who are exposed to the public or who are accused of having a COMID-19 as a high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of being exposed if workers make aerosol-regressions, or adopt or carry out appreciers from individuals who are known or accused of adding COVID-19.
The safety controls that are suitable for these operations include building controls such as joint pressure processes, and proper personal protocols.
The outbreak of*COVID-19 can have serious consequences within the working area.
Workers may be absent from the job because of sickness, the need to care for others, or the fear of being exposed to it.
Marketing practices may change, both of which are needed, with ways of getting the goods (such as shopping in leisure times or by getting in the way of transportation or driving jobs).
Finally, the transfer of goods from the affected areas of COVID-19 may be disturbed. The preparation for infectious disease and response systems can be used to monitor protective action.
Programs consider the risks involved in different workplaces and types of work, including the type of exposure, the risk factors coming from home or social conditions, and the hazards of individual workers as well as conditions of advanced age or illness.
They also highlight proper control so that such accidents can be met, and the following programs of situations can develop as a result of an eruption.
The readiness for a infectious disease and response programs may depend on the motivation of national or provincial legislation.
The goals of responding to an explosive situation include limiting sexual activity between employees, protecting people at high risk of serious health problems, keeping a business, and reducing the heavy effects of other businesses and consumers.
The weight of the disease in the community under which the business is involved affects the reactions taken.
Risk-control steps are a general use of the Occupational safety and health control by the effects.
When the dangers of COVID-19 are not removed, better control of the construction control is followed by control control, and ultimately self-responsures.
Construction management involves separating workers from work - related dangers without relying on the worker’s routine, and it can be a step toward greater expense when admitted.
Management of changes in business policy or procedures that require the action of an employee or an employer
Personal protocol activity (PPPE) is a less effective than management and management controls, but it can help prevent exposure.
All PPE types must be selected based on the worker's risk, properly dressed as appropriate (y.i., indulgences), worn regularly, checked regularly, stored, and altered, required, and cleaned properly, and kept or disposed for pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OtherA), low - risk activities have little social contact with the community and other peers.
Simple measures to protect the virus in all workplaces include repeated and more thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, good breathing habits including coughing and sneezing, performing throats and dishcloths, preparing to work around the home or on the refrigerator, encouraging workers to avoid using tools and equipment, and keeping on cleaning and killing bacteria in the workplace.
Early detection and quarantine of infected people may be a vital step in protecting employees, customers, watches, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with a risk risk disorder stay at home until they are unable to heat, and some symptoms for at least 24 hours without using antidepressants, and that the rules for day care of the sick family member, allow workers to stay at home to care for these rules.
According to Osha, jobs that are present at the center include those jobs that require regular contact or close to six points (1.8 m) with non-viD-19 patients, who are considered to have SARS-CoV2 virus due to ongoing human interference in a nearby working community, or because someone has recently returned from a foreign land that has a widespread link with the COVID-19.
These include staff members who can contact the public as schools, high - rise jobs, and high - level market conditions. Creating control of these high - risk groups includes installing high - risk groups, setting up high - speed airfellers, raising the level of operating system, setting limits as security barriers, establishing a window for traffic control over the client’s maintenance system. Maintaining a high level of the task task task task task force includes encouraging patients to stay at home, setting up a path - management system, creating high - speed control system, creating high maintenance systems, controlling behavior skills, controlling behaviors, controlling behaviors, holding routines, holding behavior skills, and management skills.
Employees in this contact group rarely need to use ambulances.
If a person becomes ill in a plane, proper control programs for the workers and other passengers include separating the patient from another person by a distance of 6 points, putting one member of the crrew to care for the patient, and giving a face mask to the patient or to ask him to put his mouth and nose on his throat when he coughs or sneezes.
The cager must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or in contact with body makeup or areas that may be contaminated, and there may be additional precautions if the patient has a fever, persistent cough, and when it is difficult to breathe.
Gloves and other items lost should be disposed of in a biohazard case, and the exposed areas should be cleaned and contaminated later. In connection with passenger ships, including travel ships and other passenger transport vessels, control the anchor includes stopping the journey when you are ill, and identifying and informing the local medical center as soon as someone begins to start a fever or other symptoms while riding.
If possible, medical follow-up should cause damage to a separated person. In schools and day - care facilities, the CDC recommends temporary removal with the purpose of cleaning and disinfecting if an infected person has been inside the school building regardless of the prevalence.
If there is little or no room in the community, permanent separation schemes may be introduced as an invitation to thefield trip, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as natural education, schoolrooming or meals, increased space between desks, visits to half the return times, marriage of less important visitors, and the use of a different office for children with flulike symptoms.
When the virus spreads significantly in the community, despite efforts to keep people away from it, it may be considered closed schools. In law enforcement workers who perform daily activities, the health risk of this time is considered low by the CDC.
The law personnel who must contact people who are confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as those of medical emergency workers, including appropriate personal safety products.
If there is a close connection between contact, workers should clean up and remove germs from their work belts and clothing before reuseing them with spray or house cleaning cloth, and follow the usual procedure to prevent the spread of the virus and the disposal of PPE that has been used and by keeping and washing the clothes.
The Osha suggests that certain medical and cold personnel are at greater or greater risk of exposure to the disease.
The services of the most vulnerable include medical, relief supplies, laboratorys, and medical personnel who are exposed to known patients or who are suspected of having COVID-19.
These become the greatest risk of exposure to disease when workers develop procedures that develop aerosol, or that they collect or handle samples, from known patients or suspects that they have COVID-19.
The processes that develop the aerosol include abrasion, processes that cause coughing, bronchoscopies, procedures and examination of the teeth, or the collection of samples of the body.
The colding activity of the most dangerous disease includes personnel involved in preparing bodies of persons with known risk or suspects that they have COVID-19; these become the greatest danger when studying corpses. More engineers of these risk groups include private rooms for known patients or suspected cases of COVID-19, including the procedure for the creation of aerosol.
Special ventilation by a high pressure pressure may be appropriate to other health - care and cold units.
Samples should be handled by the Biosafity Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients be classified in separate waiting areas for the possibility that they have a COVID-19. In addition to PPE, Osha encourages respirators to those who work apart from the noted, or suspect, patients that they have the SARS-CoV2 virus, and those who develop the mechanisms that develop aerosol.
In the United States, NIOSH - approved or better - approved NIOSH crystals must be used as a complete system of self-respirators, which includes physical screening, exercise, and medical examinations.
Some types of respirators can provide more protection and development for the worker's well-being. WHO does not encourage moldals, since COVID-19 is an invasive disease rather than through body fluids.
WHO only encourages the surgical masks of the crew who are cleaning the entrances.
To those who collect the samples of smell, care for, or transport the COVID-19 patients without the development of aerosol, WHO promotes surgical masks, mirrors, or facilitants, lemons, and gloves.
If aerosol is developed, N95 or FFP2 respirator is replaced by a surgical mask.
Because PPE is not available enough in the world, WHO encourages reducing the need for PPE by telephone contact, physical deterrents as showing about it, which only allows those who are directly involved in treatment to enter a room with a COMID-19 patient, use only the necessary PPE for a specific job, and continue to use the same password without taking it out while caring for many patients with the same disease, guarding and controlling the access to PPPE, and restricting the use of masks to people without symptoms.

PRESENTATION: [Covid-19] To reduce the burden and to prepare for the future
PEAK NUMBER WITNESSING: 14, March 20, 00:24 UTC
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: CC0: No licensed rights
We find ourselves in a unique position this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a factor that makes it clear how people in the world are connected with our responsibility to one another.
We have never been in a situation like this, but we know that how we react to it depends on the kind of empathy that exists in the world, the good cooperation, and the built - up of the community.
The cooperation and consideration we have seen in all our workers by e-mail, telephones, and chats is a remarkable guarantee that we have good people to work with.
I am truly happy and proud to work with you.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
He reminded me how logical it is for the earth to be able to open up Wipedia right now, and this is a powerful sign of this vital resource to remain accessible to the Internet and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep access to social networking sites or whether your employees are being paid for it or our communities.
The earth needs the information that is available on Wipedia, now more than ever.
That is when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a powerful impact on the earth.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make significant changes in the way we deal with them, starting with the next convention.
Changes in our work and termites
As Robyn had said earlier, the mambac had assembled the previous evening and discussed how we will work with our host for the days and months to come.
In the course of the conversation, we considered what we felt would be a fine response to our situation and how best to keep the organization going during this time.
We should not expect to eliminate stress and support our long - term goal.
If you need to drive again, that is fine.
For all employees, contract companies, and contract workers:
Our expected daily work will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the change is announced.
We do not announce vacation - if we can work longer hours, the company can use them.
Now, however, things are uncertain in the world, and whether you need to care for loved ones, buy food, or go to a doctor, your health comes first.
We cannot follow you in the first place.
If you are sick, don’t work.
There’s really no need to say that, but we’ll say it.
You do not need to install sick days or PTO - you will simply tell your manager and help your fellow party to reprogram calendars and hangouts to ensure that the major parts of the work are being accomplished.
( If you are diagnosed with the CVID-19 virus, please tell Bryan between the T&C Ops so that the T&C can assist with support and ensure that your condition is properly cared for by the administrators).
Part - time workers will be paid to the full.
We have already said, and we are committing ourselves to fulfilling our obligations to our labor force and to those working hour hours.
Everyone will be paid on his regular working hours.
This includes when you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we have our support.
Many people use work as a means to bring their stress into harmony with the things around us.
What we do can be a unique reward, especially in times such as this.
Again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your supervisor, so that we can know what we can expect and plan in accord with it.
Some jobs are taken as an important profession.
There are some things we must keep on doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fudraing (among others) are performing a critical task that may require more support.
We will begin the process with all the doors to review current goals and adjust our focus to support what is essential to our goal.
There is much that all of us can do, but we will focus on the more important programs.
Losing pace now will not harm us later.
We don't plan to "work frequently to catch the termites" when the epidemic is over.
You will not be expected to work longer hours in order to complete an assignment at a time that is very unusual at this time.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and times when they are appropriate.
What happens with the AP (Annual Planing)?
To change to our new circumstances and hours of work expected every day, we intend to change our Annual Plan delivery period of 2020-2021.
Our aim is to suggest the expanding of our 2013-20 edition that allows more time for the work force to take priority, take care of themselves, and care for their loved ones while assisting those who need or wish to work a reduced term of the term used in the next few weeks.
This stretch of work greatly reduces the current organized activity and pressures the rest of the organization.
We will introduce what we suggest to Bodi about the coming week and will reward the representatives and crowds for the next steps as soon as we have the assurance.
Thanks for the APP team for taking the lead in this regard.
Office shape, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we read that another of our SF workers may be exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we sent a cleaning crew to clear out germs from all parts of the San Francisco office.
Use a microorganism soap to remove germs everywhere, as well as to the reception area, and to laboratory areas that enter our area.
A building uses its own immune system by using products that support the safety of its supply.
We feel that the office will be right when we decide to return to it.
Our DC office is in We Work, which shared with us its COVID-19 protocol with all DC staff.
Since last week, our DC office has moved to a remote area that has been fully occupied in accordance with the direction given to San Francisco.
As our other staff of the NYC knew, we have been discussing renting property in Brooklyn.
These conversations continue but may last for some time.
Some of our employees work longer hours than we did in the first place.
Our long - term employees know that great changes can be made, and they want to give you advice:
Reduce the length of the meetings by at least an hour or two.
If longer meetings are needed, consider how you can arrange for them over a period of days.
Explain clearly what the meeting is about, keep a goya, and send things to be read in advance.
Do this regularly with video, using such tools as Google Docs and Zoos to work and communicate privately.
Take the lead in conducting all the meetings, someone who will look up the interviews and follow up the list of speakers, and someone who will help write notes (or make notes for all of you).
Send e-mail to network servers if you need a good headset.
Use your social money to buy chewing products.
Check the #remories on Black to chat with your colleagues about the sent task
The HR Operations team needs guidance from Internet departments in effective operation to support the increase in the activity sent to the entire Company.
This past week we have asked all middle - class middle - class people to announce events supported by Wikimedia, such aseditatorons, WHO, until the epidemic is over.
We will tell them that we have come to understand that our request for a loan and that other restrictions would prevent them from completing their work on the approved backs and that no one will be paid for delays or change their goals.
This coming week we will follow another direction in Wikimania and other provincial and regional councils.
The general feeling of the world’s population seems to be a loss of frustration but freedom from explanation and opportunity to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and so forth.
In time, the CRT works to filter a page on Malta-Wiki so that it will be provided a public space to look for the impact and follow our discussions with them.
Conservative information related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar on next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special meeting of the workers.
We will use the time to exchange further comments, to answer your questions, and to spend time with each other.
We work together and will help you wherever we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information in this email, with all the other major COMID-19 related information, from the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages locked with all information in the same location.
We also work to keep regular contact with the workers living in countries that are now seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a major job route, the average challenge, or anything else you may need to help, please be quick to tell you and work with CRT.
We are here to help support and communicate when needed.
If you have a confidential or critical account, please send an e-mail to the Bryan Judea -HR International Operations director.
None of these changes should be viewed as a personal decision, such as leaving a job or an assignment.
Instead, they recognize that at this time, our work and our obligations will likely need to be adjusted as never before.
These steps are believed to be necessary in order to support one another in order to carry on the work, to give our team support that they need, and to the world to which you trust.
Our scheduled work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
In the meantime, it is a time to support and create an opportunity for meaningful activity that may exist in the weeks and months to come.
We all need to do so, so we all need to care for ourselves and our family in order to be fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, please take your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Anma K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan, M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leaders (Grant I, Mother W, Jaime V, Jane V, Jane U, Lisa S, Rosa S, Robyn A, Ryan, and Toby N).
The b'Angiotsin-converting enzyme (ACE2) is an external enzyme (in the cell membrane) in the lungs, the arteries, the heart, the kidneys, and the intestines.
ACE2 combats the operation of angiotsin-convening enzyme (ACE) by reducing the number of angiotsin-I and raising Ang(1-7) to make it a promising medicine for treating heart disease and blood. ACE2 also serves as a place for entering cells into certain coronaries.
An amme type is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotsin-convening enzyme 2 is a metabloenzyme with tarin that is found in the face of other cells.
ACE2 protocol contains the N-terminal terminal configuration M2 and the C-terminal terminal terminal terminal renal amano acid exporter.
ACE2 is a protein of the membrane I is one-type, with its enzymes exposed to the face of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer cells of the ACE2 cell are separated from thetransmembrane unit by a enzyme known as shedase, and the active protein contained is extracted from the blood and eventually leaks into the urine.
ACE2 is present in a number of body components: ACE2 is associated with the cell membrane mainly with the cells of the 2 types of alcohol, the submerities of the tiny intestines, the arterial and the venous endorial cells, and the tissue cells that are free of disinfected from most of the body.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainsem.
The main function of ACE2 is to function as ACE register.
ACE divides angiotsin I hormone into vasectomy annotsin II.
ACE2 splits the carboxyl-terminal's acidic alphabet from animotsin II (Asp-Arg-Arg-Vyr-Yle-Hil-His-Pro-PE) and divides it into a vasodator anaotsin (1-7), (H-Arsp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Yle-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also separate several other peptides to include the [des-Arg9] bradykin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, andghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the movement of autral amino acid transmitter SLC6A19 and is linked to Hartnup disease.
Like a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as the primary entry area for certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Directly, the combination of SARS-Cov and SARS-CoV2 enzymes in ACE2 molecules on the face of cells results in endocytics and in the passage of both bacteria and enzymes to the intercellular unit.
This login procedure also requires that Sprotein be operated by sterone proteas TMPRSS2, a barrier under the current diagnosis as a cure for the disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing ACE2 messages, to cells, may help fight the virus.
However, many major organisations and operating bodies have encouraged continued with the general ACE barrier and ARV therapy.
"A review of the plan and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "Use of ACE protection was associated with a major reduction 34% in the pneumonia risk of "the rulers."
"In addition," the risk of pneumonia has been reduced to patients treated with ACE preventers who have been at high risk of pneumonia, particularly those with strokes and heart.
"ACE prevention prevention has also been associated with the reduction of pneumonia, although the effects have been less serious than the damage pneumonia can cause."
The human component ACE2 (rhAC2) is thought to be a new treatment for acute lung damage, and it seems to improve the pulmonary hemodynamics oxygen output from the popolilysaccardide-inced acube respirory syndrome.
Half of rhACE2 persons take 10 hours to work and starts working after 30 minutes more than 24 hours (time).
One study shows that rhACE2 may be a safe drug for those who cannot take an anti-angiotin system system (RAS inhibitors) that are common or in cases when anginin II rotates. RHACE2 is being diagnosed in a medical study on a risk management of respiratory disease.
"BOVID-19 Apps are programs designed to help find numbers in connection with the 2010-20 epidemic of the colonavirus, such as the process of access ("virals") that may have been contacted by an infected person."
A number of programs have been developed or considered, with governmental backing elsewhere.
Stencil frames have been developed for building touchapps for the contact.
Privacy concern has been expressed, especially regarding the poster-based behavior of the tap users.
Other methods that do not require confidential information include the use of signatures in Bluetooth to replace the user’s position with other youths.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would build the way to support such vehicles in Bluetooth directly on the OS in the Androd and the OS.
In China, the Chinese government, collaborating with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check whether they have had contact with the COVID-19 people.
It is used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an App is used by Trace Together.
"This was started by local IT staff, released as an open spring and to be issued by the government. In Northern Macedonia a "Stop Corona!" App worked on Bluetooth to track exposure to people who may be infected and given immediate response to health authorities.
The App was developed by the Institute of Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, this application was expected to be approved by Google Plagley Store and Applet AppletStore.
"On April 12, the government said that the search-up was in the advanced stage of development, and it was to be available for discharge in a few weeks. The same App is prepared for Ireland, and in France ("Stop Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand consider the App based on Singapore’s Trace Tourer and BlueTrace protocol. Russia aims to create a showdown when one crosses the prescribed limits of the COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they are not displaced.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has listed a number of possible problems with the advisorys, which include misleading warnings and the chances of not receiving a warning if the ability of theapp is limited to a small number of people.
"To resolve the problems related to the goings of " " "e-coronavirus"" are misleading or dangerous, the Apple placed limits on the various types of organisations which can include the club-coronavirus access to its App Square, which said it would be the only "law" or the trusted organisations.
Googles and Amazons have established similar boundaries.
Conservatives express their concern about the problems of detection by the mass of people using coronavirus Apps, especially about the development of a research program designed to handle the coronavirus epidemic will be traced once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement that limits this type of search.
These organizations have imposed nine restrictions on government projects:
"A search should be "Legal, necessary and proper"").
the passing of the period of caution and observation must have a matter of sunsets;
The use of data should be limited to the COVID-19 purposes;
the protection of a tower and unknown names will have to be protected and proved to be protected on the basis of evidence;
a simple examination should avoid lessening the vices of racism and reducing the value of property;
any sharing of the time with other persons shall be required by law;
there should be caution against misuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
"A helpful participation is all" who have "particular" and which includes public health experts and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and the Sports Without Borders (Reporter one with Ghenden) (RSF) will also present the test lists.
The Google/Applied program aims to correct the follow-up problem by releasing the search function from OS viss when you no longer need it.
Some countries are using global explorations rather than the Apps, which eliminate both the need to dye the App and avoid tracking.
In Israel, coded follow-up was approved.
Solutions based on the network that can reach the length of the unexploded area can have serious privacy problems.
However, not all masks have major drives to get to the length of the person’s territory; the number of privacy masks has been built using large networks to communicate only (see paragraph below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based movie was used to follow a person's order.
Instead of using the selected App, the stamp collects information for research from different sources involving the tracking data for the young violet and card counter, and combine this to send text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to warn people who might be infected, the government has also made knowledge of the environment available to the public, which is permitted for many changes in code codes after MERC outbreaks in that country.
This knowledge is available to the public by means of Apps and satellites. The countries involved in Germany have considered using both the main pillars and those that protect privacy.
Since April 6, 2020, the data has not been published.
Tracking that protects privacy is a highly designed method, with many research books starting at least as early as 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than 12 teams of experts have been looking for solutions that accept privacy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to get closer to the user and other young people.
PPP-PT, however, is an effort to communicate that contains both major and varied systems, and is not a single protocol. Various protocols include Dcentralized Development-Preserving Policy Policy (DPPT/DPPP-T3T), TTCN (TCN, FSCA CONCN, Contivalt Numbers, CN), Pritication Protocol Protocols, and Plenisms for Movieing (CT).
In these physiologists, the average human dial never leaves the disk, and all the connections take place in the exchange.
The Province Group of MIT Media Lab has been developing Safepaths, a platform to use privacy protection schemes when it collects and uses the space or space of a channel to follow the advance of COVID-19.
"Based on research from the white paper" "Apps Gone Rogue: Communicationing Personal Development in an Epidemiic" published in March 2020. One similar attempt is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that developed a secret technology first developed in MIT Media Lab.
Safety uses secure musical technology to allow users to communicate with one another on a critical local and health and with other users and legal personnel, without endangering the privacy of the party.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was formed by groups connected with what has been the same way as diverse physiologists, with the goal of reducing the division, and allowing international use of the search and warning vehicles, an important factor in universal acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they were making the call of a Blue Traffic protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple firms, young Adroid and OS platforms, announced how to search people, and declared that they would protect privacy, based on the Bluetooth Low Energy technology combinations and cryptography.
They also published technical features used in symmetry.
In accordance with Apple and Google, gum is intended to be extracted in three categories:
government access to grant access to legal access to the coronavirus protection
the direct application of this factor to the OS and the Android Google and Apple systems to correct further development and care problems by sending the stamp first with OS returns, and later to remove it in the same manner after the threat has passed.

Since April, the main products of the CEPI project are rapidly faster, faster, modified, produced, and accessible to the world.
In April, CAPI scientists reported that 10 different technical platforms had been studied and invented in early 2020 to create a practical goal against COVID-19.
The large platform projects that advanced to the security research of Article I include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (start of Section I and target number: Modernna, MRNA-1273)
varol vector (The founder of Chapter I and the chart of the goal: Can Sino Biologics, Adenvirus type 5 vector)
As scientists of CEPI reported in April, 115 clients are in the early stages of the goal, and 78 are confirmed as bacterial terrorists (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 have been reported, but there is very little public knowledge (may be organized or invented).
The III research checks the safety prior to the use and combating of the virus, usually not planned, is controlled by counterfeit medicine, and is still in many locations, while more accurate, active bites are considered.
The study of Article III usually involves more role models, which include the control team, and the operation of a test to prevent disease, while the most severe results are taken in the right amount.

Since March 2020, there has been one goal (DNA) for MERS that completed the I course of medical research on people, and the other three are still being studied, and all are the objectives of vil-vectors (HAdAAx1-MERS, BVS-GamVAC). Two MVA-vectors).
Primates promote the idea that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and that the goal is already being achieved.
The tips quoted on various communications stations refer to the already present sequences of genes and the goals of some coronavirus relatives like SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a bacterial infection caused by the sextant respiration syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and asthma.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, nausea, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to the beginning of the disease is usually five days but from two to fourteen days.
While most of these events result in symptoms of disease, others result in increased pneumonia and death of many parts of the body.
Since April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is primarily spread among people who are connected, usually by tiny droplets that come out when you cough, sneeze, or speak.
Although the droplets leave in the air, they usually fall to the ground or onto objects rather than become germs in long distances.
People may also be infected by contacting the infected area and touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive by as much as 72 hours.
It takes a lot during the first three days after the initial symptoms of the disease, although it can spread before the appearance of the symptoms and later cases of the virus. The normal method of diagnosis is the transscript polymerase function reaction (rT-PCR) through the look.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who suspect that they are infected and their caregivers.
Opinions vary, some authorities say that they cannot be used, others are not used, and still others dictate that they be used.
At present, there is no specific goal or treatment against the COVID-19 virus.
Virus transmission has been found in many countries in all six areas of WHO.
Those who are infected may not have symptoms of the disease or have such symptoms as colds, colds, fatigues, and asthma.
The symptoms of emergency include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty in waking up, and blue faces and lips; encouraged to get a doctor’s help as soon as these symptoms become manifest.
Strange as it may seem, such symptoms as sneezing, coughing, or sore throat may appear.
The symptoms of disease in the mouth from the waist down to the waist like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been demonstrated by a variety of percent.
Some events in China started only with chest clumsiness and a heart beat.
In some, disease can spread into pneumonia, kill scores of organs, and kill.
This is also called the age of symptoms.
The period of outbreaks of VID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
7.5% of people with symptoms develop during 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these without symptoms in transmitting the disease to others is still not fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of infected people who do not show symptoms of disease is now known and is currently being investigated, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people have been without symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include cases of symptoms of disease in its daily figures on 1 April 1; of 166 infected patients that day,30 (78%) had no symptoms during a survey.
Both the cough and the saliva can spread the virus.
Clarity comes in a number of paragraphs instead of just regular expressions.
A study in Singapore has found that uncovered coughs can lead to about 15 feet [4.5 m] of collapsible joints.
Although the virus is not normally transmitted to the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted by inhalation, and air - conditioned air storage units outside the rooms released contaminated samples of the RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures, such as the installation of tube and cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the production of crystals to be pumped into the air and result in the increase in breathing.
While there is concern that the risk may be spread by pollution, the risk is thought to be relatively small, and the virus is highly contagious when people have symptoms; although outbreaks may occur before symptoms of disease appear, there is little danger.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not fully clear how easily the virus spreads, one person usually joins two or three persons. The virus lives for hours through days.
In particular, it was found that the virus lives on the board for one day, about three days in plastic and iron (ASSI 304), and about four hours in a bullet 99%.
This varies, however, according to humidity and temperature.
Soap can also be effective if it is used properly; soap products reduce the protective layer of infected fat, kill it, and remove it from the skin and other areas.
Other soaps, such as betelconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconte, do not function properly. In Hong Kong research, saliva samples were taken two days after hospitalization.
In 5 out of 6 patients, the first sample showed the number of high infection, and the sixth patient showed the number of the highest infection on the second day after diagnosis.
The ecrate respiration syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the worst - serious scissory respirary syndrome, which begins with three cases of pneumonia and was linked to many severe respiratory infections in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV2 virus are from the coronavirus.
When outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which explodes its protective balloon. SARS-CoV2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected in a COVID-19 because the virus enters the primary cells of the enzymes called angiotsin-convening enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in large numbers in the two types of alveor cells in the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called "" spike" (peplomer) to connect ACE2 and enter into the primary cell.
The worst heart damage was found in 12% of hospital infected people in Wuhan, China, and is most likely to occur in serious illnesses.
High levels of Cardiovascular disease, cause swelling of the hip and immune system during the rise of the disease, but severe heart attacks may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are most visible in the heart and involved in heart activity.
The risk of thronosis (3%) and venous thromboemulism (25%) is found in ICU patients with the CVID-19 virus and may be related to a weak prognosis. The discovery of COVID-19 people killed by a COVID-19 showed diffuse alcohol violence (DAD), and swelling with lymphocycyte in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV 2 contains ACE2-expression respiratory electrical activity, patients with COVID-19 critical have symptoms of systemic hyperflammation.
In particular, latogenic GM-CSF-secreing T-cells appear to be consistent with the discovery of IL-6-separating logins and the causes of serious respiratory infections in COVID-19 patients.
Immphocytic infiltrates have also been reported during autopsies.
The WHO has published a number of lab tests.
The usual method of testing is to convert a polymerase Chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests are usually done in respiratory samples obtained from a palm tube; however, a nose tube or a sample of a sputum can also be used.
Results usually come after a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but this requires two sets of blood that are taken during two weeks and are of little significance at the time.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate part of the coronavirus and record the sequence of the elements so that the world’s laboratory cells can develop the polymerase keyaction (PCR) test to identify the virus by disease.
Since April 4, 2020, a study of disease elements (which can be found to be active and if man has already been infected) has been developed, but it has not been widely used.
The Chinese findings in survey show that accuracy is 60 to 70% only.
The FDA in the United States approved the first medical examination on March 21, 2020 that was used at the end of that month. The testing guidelines published by Wunhan University Hospital suggested ways of detecting the virus on the basis of medical and risk of disease control.
Bilateral multiary circles opaities spread with peripheral, ammetric, and posterior are common in infection.
Subpleumal dominance, crazy paving.
Small amounts are available from the microcopic sexts and the COVID-19throphysiology.
The key factors found in research are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, percarditis, feeling console and pulmonary edema
The four types of pneumonia’s weight can be seen:
common pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneucyte hyperplasia, general typical pneumocyte, interstatic inflammation with lymphocytic infrails, and mulnicated liver action.
acute pneumonia: diffuse an alveor daimage (DAD) and diffuse anlveor exhudates.
AD is the cause of acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and the hypoxemia.
biodegradable pneumonia: a mixture of exidates in alcohol caviries and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: dissimilar environment (DIC); lekorythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowds, washing hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds, getting used with oral hygiene and nose, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC encourages to close your mouth and nose with a cough or sneeze and encourages the use of the snail's inner core when the moth is missing.
Good hand washing after coughing or sneezes is encouraged.
The CDC encourages the use of masks when in the public, in part to reduce infection from people who have no risk of infection. Social isolation programs are intended to reduce contact between infected people and large groups by closed schools and workplaces, preventing travel and attracting large gatherings.
The precautions of isolation include being kept separate by at least 6 fathoms (1.8 m).
‘ No known medication is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since the goal is not expected until 211, at least, the leading method of controlling COVID-19 to try to reduce the number of those who are infected, called "to make the line flat".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before eating and after coughing, coughing, and sneezing.
It also encourages the use of at least 60% alcohol-spacing, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In places where hand - to- hand tires are not readily available, WHO provides two ways of producing it in the environment.
In these ways, the work of antibacterials comes from ethanol orisopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help rid the bacteriapores from alcohol; "" is not killing the virus in hand washing products."
Glycerol is fitted to create moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include fluid treatment, oxygen supply, and support of other important organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those with suspects that they are infected are wearing normal facial masks.
The extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to solve the respiratory problem, but its benefits are still considered.
Hygiene, life - style, and healthful food have been encouraged to prevent infection.
Physical therapy can help those who have new symptoms of disease. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published suggestions to care for hospital patients with COVID-19.
Intensivists and U.S. pulmonologists include methods of treatment from various contexts at free source, IBCC.
Since April 2020, there is no cure for COVID-19.
When the symptoms of the disease appear, some doctors encourage paracetamol (acetanophen) rather than ibuprofen.
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in medical facilities where techniques can produce aerosols, such as invasive or hand ventilation.
For doctors who care for patients with COVID-19, the CDC encourages a person's preservation of Airborine Infection Device (AIR) in addition to taking simple steps, to avoid contact and inhaling the virus. The CDC defines the guidelines for the use of personal protocol equiptive activity (PPPPE) during the epidemic.
Qualifications: PPE, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and gloves. When available, repirators are encouraged.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use but the FDA authorizes to be used under Emergency Use (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air as dust, but protection from a certain body general is not guaranteed for its use.
If masks are not found, the CDC suggests using masks or, if there is no other way, automated masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so bad that they may need radio navigation or other means, but some are needed.
A form of air - breathing support related to COVID-19 is still being studied by patients in the hospital, and there is some evidence that an invasive condition can also be avoided by high flulow and sal cannonoula or bi-table polysis apressure.
Whether these two conditions result in the same positive outcome for people who are seriously ill is not clear.
Some doctors prefer to live with an invulnerical ventilation when it is available because this method reduces the spread of absorbed particles compared with the high light and salnula. The worst conditions are common in adults (over 60 years of age, especially more than 80).
Many developing countries do not have adequate hospital beds, which reduce the number of cases that make it impossible to handle the sudden increase in the number of patients with CVID-19, which require hospitalization.
One study in China found 5% in the emergency area, 2.3% in need of intervention, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30 percent of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually installed into the ICU.
Prevention machines become more complex as acute respiration disorder (ARDS) is developed in COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
Interteraters with high pressure-depressants and high PEEPs are needed to increase the availability of oxygen while reducing the risk of the lung damage associated with theventilator and pnemothorax.
PEEP may not be found in old hostators.
Medical research began on January 2020, and a number of antiviral drugs are on medical research.
Remdesivir appears to be the most effective one.
Although with the introduction of new drugs in 1921, several of the tested drugs are already prescribed for alternative or already advanced studies.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people who have a serious infection.
WHO encourages volunteers to take part in research on the effectiveness and safety of drugs that can be used for treatment. The FDA temporarily prescribes convalescent plasma as a treatment that is studied in cases where serious side effects are involved.
It has not yet entered the medical research needed to prove that it is safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, a youth's touch-infrastructure process was developed in China.
Users are asked to enter the name and ID number.
This app is able to see 'if you are close to a person' using a detector that could be a risk to infection.
All users can monitor the situation of three other users.
If a potentially dangerous situation appears, the App not only encourages isolation, but also warns health authorities. A lot of data analysis on the age of a youth, the ability to monitor the face, the following youth's phone and acquired information is used to transport infected people and infected people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, Israel's government authorized safety ambulances to track the phone record of a young person who was thought to have coronavirus.
This is done to keep them away from society and to protect those who may have contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, the Deutsche Tekokom shared the data of the telephone area with the German government’s Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia developed the facial expressions to find out who broke the laws of social isolation.
"Advisor of the Italian province of Giulio Galla said you had been told the youth's staff that "" "40% of the people continue to go around"".
The German government has run a 48-hour - a-day federal computer competition for 42,000 winners on the weekend.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulad, has issued a national declaration of resolutions against the spread of the colonavirus.
People may experience withdrawal symptoms, loss of mobility, side effects of medication, or fear of being infected.
"BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as "The ongoing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, depression and economic collapse is a storm damaging the minds and well-being."
The virus may have fewer or less side effects, similar to other common respiratory infections as a common cold.
Common cases have been healed within two weeks, while those infected with a serious or serious virus may take from three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at greater risk for the critical coviD-19 virus based on the spread of other common viruses, such as SARS and MEORS, but the level of COVID-19 is missing. For some people, CIVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
For those particularly affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop a risk of respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and cause damage to the respiratory system, the sprock or multiple organs.
The problems associated with COVID-19 include sopsis, bnormal clocking, heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Cloting anomaritises, especially the increase in prothrombin time, are found 6% of those who are admitted to the hospital because of COVID-19, whereas kidney defects appear in 4% of this group.
Almost 20-30% of the people with COVID-19 show high liver enzymes.
According to the same report, the rate of time between the onset of symptoms of disease and death is ten days, and five are taken to the hospital.
However, patients who are transferred to ICU have about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early events, the average time from the first diagnosis of the disease to the death was 14 days, totaling 6 to 41 days.
In a National Health Commission (NHC) survey in China, the average mortality rate for males is 2.8% while the mortality rate is 1.7%.
The molecular molecular molecular pathways for autopsies show diffuse anlveor damage and cellulular fibroxoid ehutics in both lungs.
The change of the viral cytothics was seen in the pneumocytes.
A look on the lung showed acute respiratory discs syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart injuries were noted in the high levels of thetroponon or heart condition.
According to the March calendar from the United States, 89 percent of those hospitalized already had diseases. The discovery of medical and economic and regional factors can contribute to death.
Estimates of human deaths from infectious diseases vary from region to region, but they are also due to difficulties in methods used.
Fewer cases of worse conditions can cause an unexpected death rate.
However, the fact that death is the result of events already infected can mean that the mortality rate is now low.
Nonsmokers have 1.4 times the risk of detecting the critical symptoms of COVID-19 and are nearly 2.4 times as likely to receive emergency care or death compared with non-smokers. Concerns have been shown about long before the virus.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a 20 - to 30% drop in the working of some infected people on the lungs, and lung scans that indicate that it is likely to be injured.
This can also lead to severe postoperative infections after recovery.
By March 2020, it was not known that the previous virus could contribute to effective and long- term protection for people recovering from the virus.
Protectment from infection seems to be possible, based on other coronaviruss, but circumstances have been reported in which recovery on COVID-19 has been followed by a critical examination of the coronavirus.
These conditions are thought to be a rise in infection rather than a reemergence.
It is thought that the virus is natural and that it evolved from animals, then from humans.
The exact origin is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost entirely guided by transfer from one person to another.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published on January 2020 in Lancet, showed that the first day of outbreaks of disease symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official documents of WHO reported that the initial symptoms of the disease occurred on December 8, 2019.
Several methods are widely used to calculate the mortality of people.
These numbers vary from region to region and depending on the degree of diagnosis, medical science, medical practice, time from the beginning to the aspects of age, sex, and health.
Toward the end of 1920, WHO distributed urgent CD-10, U.S.1 that was killed by the SARS-CoV2 confirmed laboratory virus and U07.2 killed by COVED-19 by doctors and screened surgeons except for SARS-CoV2 verified laboratory tests. The rate of deaths shows the number of those killed in the process of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the rate of deaths worldwide is 6.9% (153,822/2.240,191) on 17 April 2020.
A number vary from region to region. Other methods include case factorality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of infected bodies, and input factor radiation (IFR), which represents the percentage of people infected (we are infected and not infected) who are killed by the virus.
These figures are not based on time and are followed by a number of individuals from infection to problem solving.
Although not all infected people become infected with the agents of the disease, the presence of the disease factors can tell how many people are infected.
In an area where the most infected persons in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small area of 4,600, 80.7%) are already dead.
In the Gangel, the virus was spread by Carnival conferences, and it was introduced into young people, which caused lower mortality rates, and not all who were killed by COVID-19 were officially recognized as infected.
Furthermore, the German health certificate has not yet large numbers.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may be infected, as blood donors are examined.
669 (0.004% of the population) were assured that they had been killed by COVID-19.
The toll of the epidemic and the mortality rate differs from that of men and women.
The mortality rate is higher for males in China and Italy.
The biggest risk for men is by 50 years of age, and the gap between men and women is limited to 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The underlying reasons for these differences are unknown, but genetic and moral factors may be the reason.
The variety of sexually transmitted diseases, the lower number of women who smoke as well as men who have other conditions such as hypertension at an early age than women can contribute to a higher rate of dying males.
In Europe, 57% of infected people are male and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government does not follow the sexual profile of the COVID-19 virus.
Studies show that increasing infections such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health - care workers, mostly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be infected.
"World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus would be "COVID-19".”
WHO prime minister Tedros Adhanno Ghebreyus explained that CO represents the corona, V stands forvirus, D stands for the disea, and 19 refers to the year marked by the first outbreak: December 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen not to be named a specific region (such as China), animal or group of people, in accordance with the proposals of different countries intended to prevent discrimination. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2).
"The WHO also uses "" the COVID-19 virus" and "" the virus that causes COVID-19" in public conversation.
"Both disease and virus are often called "coronavirus".
"During the first outbreaks in Wuhan, China, bacteria and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan' coronavirus."
In January 2020, WHO suggested that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov acuvi respiratory disease as names to be used for infection and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines against the use of sites in terms of disease and germs.
The official terms COVID-19 and SARS-CoV2 are published on 11 February 2020.
Because of the lack of goods in the production industry, some manufacturers print medical products such as clubs and parts of movies.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needs theventitor valve, and the surgeon cannot send it when needed, the local company used its equipment and printed 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, speculations, false and misleading news came about as far as the origin, the spread, the ban, the treatment and other aspects of the disease were immediately spread to the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to other animals.
Studies have failed to provide evidence of the spread of pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no prescribed medication or therapy.
International research of the goals and medicines of COVID-19 is conducted by government agencies, school teams and industrial researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization started "AUGH" to examine the results of treatment for four available anti-bacterial drugs with high hopes that it will work."
There is no vaccine available, but various showers are used to develop vaccines.
The previous SARS-CoV function is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 both use ACE2 receptor to gain access to human cells.
Three effective vaccines are examined.
First, researchers are planning to develop a vaccine.
The purpose of the use of a virus such as this, invalid or dead, is to develop the body's reaction to the new OVID-19 virus.
The second method, subunit vactines, is designed to set the goal that the immune system will respond to certain aspects of the virus.
If SARS-CoV2 is, such research focuses on S-spike protein that helps the virus get into ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third method is the goals of nucleic acid (the goals of DNA or RNA, a new method of building a goal).
The goals examined in any of these ways will be considered for prevention and activity. On March 16, 2020, the first study of this goal was started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The goal contains an unimpaired gene code copied from the disease-oriented virus. Development based on the properties of disease has been suggested as a challenge to the development of SARS-COV2 goals, but this is not guaranteed.
More than 300 medical studies have been underway since April 2020.
Seven studies have been studying the already prescribed treatment for malaria, including four studies of hydrooxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reinfective drugs make up most of China’s research, and a nine study of remmusivism III in a number of countries will send a report toward the end of April.
The powerful recovery of the medical goal of COVID-19 and alternative medicine had begun, in April 2020. A number of available antibiotics are studied in the treatment of COVID-19, including removivir, chloroquine and hydrochloquine, lopinavir/ritonvir and lapinavir/rionvitar are contaminated with interfersta.
There was physical evidence of remesivir activity, in March 2020.
The progress in patient treatment that has been manifest to the full use of re-desivir.
The medical study of Sage III is conducted in US, China, and Italy. The chloroquine, previously used for malaria treatment, was studied in China in February 2020, with unauthorized results.
However, research results are being proposed.
Health officials in Korea and China recommend chloroquine to be used.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while promoting one gram of day per day, notes that the figure is twice as high as and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued permission to use in emergency conditions for hydrochchloroquine and chloroquine by seeing doctors treating viD-19. The 7 codes of China included interferon, Ribalin orumiphenvir in the COVID-19 treatment.
The unenforced date indicates that high Ribabilin levels are essential in preventing SASS-CoV2 from inviro.
Nizzoniide has been suggested in the ongoing lab study of SARS-CoV 2. Research shows that the first increase in protein priming by transmembane protea sister 2 (TMPRSS2) is the key to SARS-CoV2 entry by contact with ACE2.
The research of chloroquine and hydrochloroquine, together with or without it, has large limits that hinder the health community from obtaining this treatment without further research. Oselmiavir does not prevent SARS-CoV2 from Vitrotro and has an unknown role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The Cytokin winter can be a problem in the later classes of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can have anti-cytokine testum. Tolicimib has been added to medical guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after the small research has been completed.
An unpredictable study of paragraph 2 was conducted in Italy after showing serious results for people with a serious disease.
Combined with a semferritinal blood test for cytokin weeks, it is designed to prevent the occurrence of this, thought to be responsible for the death of some affected persons.
The interleukin-6 receptor notagonist was authorized by the FDA based on previous research on treating steroid cyctory cytokine reease, CAR T, in 2017.
So far, there is no unplanted, controlled evidence that toociliumb is effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of contaminated and powerful antibodies produced by those who are treating them in the COVID-19 people in need is examined as a means of non-protective protection.
This method was tried in SARS and the results are unknown.
Rival andulation are the recommended means used in which mild treatment of disease components can cause protection against SARS-CoV2.
However, other options, such as cellular cytotoxicity based on the elements and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Other treatments, for example, with the use of antibodies with the same cells, are introduced.
The production of convalent serum, which contains a blood - plasma component from healthy patients and that contains the antibodies associated with the virus, can be elevated to faster use.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenling, a physician at the Central Hospital of WUhan, who later became infected and died as a result of COVID-19 after helping to lose consciousness about infection.
