There are several basic services and different integrity keepers, so these creatures have come to live where they will need a variety of other needs or to tolerate different weather conditions in order to produce more energy than they once needed.
Living things in themselves have not turned out just a matter of chance. They need to be adjusted to the physical universe as they once were.
With the passing of time, these new creatures start to adapt to new surroundings, becoming less and less plants than any other living thing.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two organisms will come together until they are called the same species.
We call this process evolutionary, namely the creation of new species. The creation of species is the most inevitable and important biological impact.
