Members of a Welsh convention are concerned that they appear to be stupid
There are AMs that are concerned because they are being lifted to be MWPs (A member of Parliament of Wales).
This has been done because arrangements have been made to change the name of the Welsh Parliament.
The Ams in every political sense is concerned that this will lead to their being washed.
One AM Labour says that his group is concerned that the pronunciation of this new name is close to the terms "Twp" and "Pwp."
To the student who does not live in Wales: Welsh upup means a stupid one and rap doesn’t.
The AM of Wales's organisation has said that the whole organisation is not interested in this, and has suggested other names.
A member of the Conservative college in Wales said that his team had no problem with the change of name, but he has seen that it would be easier to call MWP in the way you call a fool.
In this case the English form of the letters w is the same as the letteru in English.
The Assembly Commission, engaged in setting up a policy to change the name to this new one, saying: "The decision of how to call the Members of the Assembly will be taken by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly permission to change its name.
By June, the Commission has issued results in public answers and has found that many have supported the change of the convention to be called the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the Ms, the Commission prefers that Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMPs, but people support the MWP.
The AMs are said to recommend otherwise, but that it is difficult to agree on this matter must be the problem with Ellin Jones, the Executive Officer, who is expected to make a change in the weeks to come.
This policy of change will include other changes that will be made in the function of the conference, including the rules against the AMs and the structure of the committee.
The Ms votes that will be read the last time the rule is discussed on the question of how to be called.
Macedonians will vote to change their country name
The voters will vote on Sunday even if they have changed their country's name into the "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The vote is made to resolve a centuries - old conflict with neighboring Greece and a province of Macedonia.
The Athenians once claimed that the name of their neighbors in the north made them an encumbrance in their area, and they have long been against their claim to be members of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjoge Ivanov, who is opposed to the change of the name vote, said that he ignored the vote.
However, supporters of the vote, including Prince Zan Zaev, say that this change of name is the price they have to pay for to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin Beats as They St. Harlem
Mr. Adams said: "The old people I talked to said that there had long been a bar and a church everywhere."
"Today, not one of them."
He explained why the barley offerings had come as no surprise.
He said: "People are having a different way of life" these days.
"Bari is no longer the living quarters in the neighborhood where people regularly go."
You are concerned about the churches because you think that the money they have received from selling their goods will not last as long as the leaders think, "and they will soon return to their original position."
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by people who will never help to retain the still - left local holy areas.
He said: "Most people who buy these labels are white people; therefore the day will soon come when the churches are closed, because they don't seem to be members of these churches.
Both churches were white churches before Harlem became a black place, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, in St. Martin a decade later.
The first White Weles Congregation arose in the 1930s.
The black congregation she served around was the very one that was built.
St. Martin became a black congregation under the Death. John Howard Johnson, who led a merchant exchange to 125th Street, the best street to be purchased at Harlem, against unemployment and lack of support from black people.
In 1939 the building was badly damaged by fire, but as Tat' Johnson's Church was preparing to rebuild it, it was ordered to be struck with bells.
F. David Johnson, son and successor of Tat'Johnson in St. Martin's, called the bells "the bells of the poor people."
An expert on metal drilling, he called it another way: ‘ A cultural treasure" or "a historical instrument that will never be replaced.
This expert, Tiffany Nq of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first time in the world if this metal instrument was played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the Richside Church with a lot of it 18 years ago.
Mr. Merlyweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
The main feature here in St. Martin's in the past few months has been the founders of drafts and builders, some of whom were introduced by non-teacher church leaders, others by the Rabes.
A congregation - board consisting of private administration, made up of nonteachers - penitentiaries, wrote in July to the mob that a mob would not be responsible for the congregation, although it did not contribute to the employment of drafts and underground builders.
Some members complained that the corral does not count things.
A shark injures a child with 13-year diver to obtain lobsters in California
The officers said, the shark has attacked and wounded a 13-year boy on Saturday, when he was drowned to catch a lobster in California on the day it was opened at the season of the lobster season.
This attack took place just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Echritas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB- TV that he had been swimming with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help. Then they went swimming to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said, at first I thought it was fun to hold a lobster, but later "he realized that it was shouting, ‘ I’m bitten! ’
‘ I'm forgiven!'
The bone below the neck is over the breast breast of the whole breast, "Hammel noticed this when he reached the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' until Hammel said.
The boy is flown to the Lady Children's Hospital in San Diego where they are in critical condition.
It is not known which species of shark remains.
The marine survivor, Larry Giles, said that when talking about the news, the shark had been seen there in the past weeks, but it was said that it was not a dangerous form of shark.
Giles adds that the victim is totally injured in the body above.
The officers have closed the sea from Poto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Zenitas for 48 hours to check to ensure safety.
Giles says there are more than 1535 sharks in the area, but most of them are said to be harmless.
Rainsbury's plans to move its products to the UK installation market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debehhams by having stores that have cosmetics and professional people to help.
As an important way to enter the UK's cosmetics market that earns about £2.8bn, which continues to grow while fashion and household products are down, these large tracts with makeup will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country, and will be available in more stores the next year if they do well.
The stock market is created because these stores want to use empty shelves after they are charged with TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's will expand the products you have twice as much as 3,000, including names like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. Paw Paw for the first time.
Already, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and But's Bees, will have more room to place them in places with names like those in stores like Boots.
The store will also inform the Boutique products so that many are more suitable for non-saturated people - a demand for new buyers.
Also, the Fragrance Shop vendor will test the requirements for two stores in Sainsbury's, the first open at Croydon, south of London, this past week and the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the course of the year.
Buying on the Internet even though people now buy only a little food a day at a nearby store, this requires that big stores do more to encourage people to go to them.
Mike Coupe, chief director of the Rainsbury's store, said, these stores will look like big stores with various products, as they are trying to combat expensive stores such as Aldi and Lddl for more services and other non-food products.
Sainsbury's puts the holds of the Argos in many stores and starts with Habitts because they have bought them both over the past two years. This has increased the purchase of food and bought them for profit.
Efforts at the early market to improve the benefits of cosmetics and medical facilities have failed.
His Sainsbury's tried to contact the Boots in the early 2000s, but they broke apart after fighting in a way that could distinguish the profits of the drug store from its stores.
This new plan was made after the Sainsbury's sold Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, has been its 281 drug company by £125m, three years ago.
It says Lloyds will also take part in this strategy, by increasing the high - quality solvent products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy at four stores.
Paul Mills- Hicks, merchant commander of the Sainsbury's, said: "We have altered the appearance of our passports in order to improve our customers.
We have invested in specially trained employers to be effective organizers.
The different products we have are designed to be suitable for each item, making it look for where it is readily available, is now an interesting place of makeup, and that is not exactly the same as the old method of shopping.
Peter Jones's anger is' because Holly Willoughby has stopped the business £11million
Peter Jones, famous in Dragons Den, goes's anger' after System Administrator Holly Willoughby stopped the £11million industry of the life - style product so that he can better deal with the new agreements he has with Malks and Spencer and TV.
Willoughby has no time for their products of household and jewelry such as Truly.
The business of this couple was compared to the Gwyneth Patrow's Goop product.
The driver of the This Morning program, who has 37, puts it in the Instaggram that he is moving.
Holly Willoughby left the famous Dragons" Den, Peter Jones angry that he left the last minute of a life- style product factory - to take his new connections well with Marks & Science and TV.
The sources say that Jones was “angered" when the important young woman on TV admitted to a hot Tuesday conference at her shopping center in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - reaching £1.5 million - deprives her not enough time to pay attention to household products and decorations like Truly.
This business is compared to the Gwynth Patrow's Goop product and has earned twice as much money as Willoughby's estimated £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, put in the Instaggram to leave Truly, Jones went to one of his vacation homes in Britain.
The source said: "Truly has been the most important thing for Holly.
It is worth a long time behind him for the next ten years.
The decision to leave her alone is a personal one.
Nobody believed what was happening on Tuesday, close to the celebration.
There is a store filled with goods at Marrow HQ for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the Third Morning broadcaster, among the most affluent in Britain, would cost the company millions of dollars for planting large amounts of goods from pillows to furniture and household items, and things that could delay its development.
And this may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s three mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
'Willoroughby founded Truly with Carpp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two go together on vacation, and Jones has 40 percent of its share in the Baldwin's television company.
Willoughby will be the commander of this M&S calendar and will take the place of Ant Mcpartlin as pilot of the TV program I'm A Celebrity.
The source near Jones said last day "We won't talk about his business affairs."
We said rather ‘ we love each other ’
She has made fun of criticism in the press by saying what some consider to be "disrespectful" and by speaking well of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a sacrifice?
Trump said in his mortification of the “disaster on the subject."
"I don't deny anything."
He noted that Kim’s interest was that they would meet again after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which the Trumps had been crowned as a major act of nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the nuclear threat has come to an end.
More than three months after the June conference in Singapore, North Korea’s senior ambassador, R Yong Ho, told world leaders in the United Nations on Saturday of the Universal Assembly that the North does not see the "a similar answer" from the United States to North Korea with anti-armour activities.
Rather, he said that the United States continues its focus on suppressing it.
Trump has given her hope in a talk he gave her at his wedding feast.
"We are doing well with North Korea," he said.
"We're not against North Korea."
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we get better acquainted.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim and to produce good fruitage resulted from the testing of submarines, which have brought relief to the American victims and the bones of the American army.
And she has protected her against the unusual way in which she communicates with Kim.
"It is very easy to be president, rather than 10,000 people on the outside attempting to enter this crowded stadium we would have about 200 people standing here," Trump pointed to the crowd standing right in front of him.
Indonesia's Tsunami and Mukima, destroy the Isle, kill hundreds of people
After an earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign agencies were told that they were not needed.
Even though 10 percent of the Lomboks had been removed from the area, the site did not appear to be a disaster spot, resulting in a world aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it is clear that they are not asking for world assistance, so this is a temptation," Mrszn Sumung said.
While Save the Children includes a group to Palu, there is still little doubt as to whether foreigners can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster center, said that Indonesian officials are studying the situation in Palu to see if the world agencies will be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Because of the constant quakes that hit Indonesia, the country is not always ready for an earthquake.
While tsunami shelters in Aceh are being built, some beaches are rare.
The absence of a tsunami in Palu, despite warnings, may have contributed to the death of humans.
Even in relatively minor periods, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel more difficult.
A hospital ship came out of Lombok to treat earthquake victims to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches the new disaster area.
President Joko Widdi laid the groundwork for improving Indonesia’s deteriorating developmental development while cutting down on election support, and he has spent a lot of money in repairing railways and rails.
But poor funding has afflicted Mr. As it will be reemerged in the next year.
Mr. Jono is faced with the stress of Indonesian sectarian strife, where many Muslim members have been involved in the most serious issue of this service.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their homes as groups of Christians and Muslims fight in the streets with machetes, spears, and spears, as well as other dangerous weapons.

Cromwell’s last statue to find the conflict that ‘ rewrites history ’
The removal of them will be the justice of the cosmos because of his destruction, such as that of Tabalan in the numerous traditional and religious images of his zealous Puritan followers.
But Cromwell described the advice of Mr Crick as "foolishness" and "Try to write history again."
... John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It would be inevitable if in this discussion the removal of images is taken away if the image of the Oliver Cromwell is outside the Palace of Westminster was a target.
The destruction of images in English wars was not ordered or done by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell will be offered for the actions of his great - grandfather Thomas of the first century.
The outstanding way in which Sir William Hamo Thornycroft described Cromwell is the evidence of the 19th century and part of the history of many who still think his life should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than at present, as a representative of a parliament against external pressures, largely in his case a pressure from the empire.
Whether this description is correct or not depends to a large extent on the discussion of the ongoing historical controversy.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century has influenced the development of our country in the next, and Cromwell is a person who has distinguished himself on the same side of the conflict.
What they accomplish as the Chief Protector must be celebrated and remembered.
The Deadly Zebra Attacked a Chinese Farmer and Killed
A farmer has been attacked and killed by pigs at a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
A man, described only by his figure "uuan," was found wanting with a broken bone, covered with blood near a pig in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post to report on the Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to milk his pigs at a hammock on May 30, 2005, at Xining in the Minghai Province, China.
It is said that he was accompanied by his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her lost, and he found that the door to a nearby herd of pigs is open.
He relates that in the case of a cock crowed, there was a large male goat with blood in its mouth.
Florming research confirmed that the zebra’s 550-pounder weight wounded her mother, according to the report.
"The father's legs were blood and twisted," said the cousin named "Wu," as quoted by Guinging Evening News.
Security cameras showed Yuan entering the market by 4.40 am on Thursday for feeding pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig killed neither Yuan nor his cousin.
The manager of the shopping mall told Evening News that the pig had been locked to keep it from attacking others, while the police had gathered a witness in the poor area.
Yuan's family and the local authorities are said to have talked with each other about compensation for his death.
Although rare, it is the situation in which pigs will be recorded in early contact with humans.
In 2016, the pig attacked the naked man and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, a man of serious injury.
Ten years ago, a 600-weight pig caught a Welsh farmer from a tractor until his wife drove the pig away.
After the Oregon farmer had eaten by his pigs in 2012, one of Manitoba farmers told the CBC News that the pigs did not seem to be angry but their taste of blood could cause them.
Make it a matter of play.
They are sharp - eyed, keeping watch over you... with no thought of hurting you.
You need to present the correct cause, you say.

More than 20 million people watch the attention of Kavanough Bret.
More than 20 million people who have been observing the physical evidence of the Fourth Tribunal, made by the High Court's election of Brett Kavanough and a librarian for sexual abuse which took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political state still continues, with a broadcast that interrupts the routine of the fifth practice to change at the last minute: a treaty made by the Sen of Arizona Jeff Flake to carry out the investigation of one week into a trial case.
Ford told the Senate Committee to make sure it was 100 percent that Kavanough placed his finger under the influence of alcohol and tried to free him from the high school party.
Kavanough, on the physical evidence, said he was sure 100 percent that it did not happen.
It is common to have been more than 20.4 million people who had been watching the report by Nelson on the fifth.
The company counted the number of followers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and the MSNC.
The numbers were not available at this time to appear on other networks, including the PCS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And nielsen has the desperate task of comparing people who have seen it in offices.
To put the situation, the size of the followers is the same as when viewing the major conclusions of the ball game or the Study Games.
The Fox Channel of the News, which, in view of its having a system to support Kavanough's election, leads all the other network by having followers of a rate of 5.69 million per day, says Nielsen.
ABC was in the second position with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million and CN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The interest remains high after the admonition.
Flake was the main character in the fifth drama
After the Central Branch office released a vote for Kavanough, the CNN and CBS Cameras were met on the fifth morning as they tried to climb the detective to the administrative order of the Governing Body.
He has stood his ground for several minutes in a state of shock as he criticized, speaking for the moment on CNN TV.
"I am standing here before you", said the man who is in the parable.
"Do you think you are saying the truth in the country?
He was told, "You are strong when the majority of the parachutists are powerless."
Flake had his office set out the stage and said that, before the closing of the post, there was much he could do to speak to the counseling committee.
with its broadcasts and cables all are spreading at the moment of the next hour, while the Governing Body would vote to continue the election of Kavanough to the full vote.
But Flake said he would do so only by agreeing with the FBI where he would look at charges against election in the coming week, where the Democrats were only a few groups advised.
Flake has advised this by speaking to her relative, The Democratic generator Chris Coos.
After a discussion with the Coons and other satellites, Flake makes a decision.
Flake’s choice is powerful, for there is evidence that Rilibrchus do not choose to accept Kavanauh without research.
President Trump opened the FBI for investigation of the charges charged by Kavanough.

Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-prointercence sponsors had participated in police riots, and thousands of protesters joined the protest against the enemy to mark the early Italian memorial of the separation from the vote.
A group of protesters who were caught by the chiefs of the police attacked by their eggs and sank with a powdered paint, making dust piles on the streets that would disturb tourists.

"This past year we have remained happy with some of the fun we have been to us.
I have watched my parents shed tears of joy because they were able to vote, but now we cannot continue, ’ you say.
Unless they are able to control the widespread election of the provinces during the last December, the National Pro-independence groups have had difficulty keeping that situation in this year because their best-known leaders have kept themselves in exile or under police custody waiting for a trial due to the role they played in the pursuit of the ransom and following the successful proclamation of freedom.
Joan Puig, an 42-year-year-old contractor who has recorded a proposal to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was caused by the politicians on both sides.

Try inserting an article that gave Livingston 1-0 and then succeeded in Rangers
The first article of Dolly Menga and victory in Livingston
The promotion of Livingston shocked the Rangers by passing by Steven Gerrad twice on 18 games to be made by the Ibrax director of the clubs.
The attack player Dolly Menga has confirmed it as a difference as the Gerry Holt's side rose up the stage with the Hiberian in a second.

Earlier, the FRangers had met Rapid Vienna in the European League of Europe by the Sine.
Livingston, at present, described their failure rate in this section to six games, where the principal instructor Holt was about to experience victory as he replaced Kenny Miler in the past month.
Livingston missed the opportunity for illegal tourists
The Holt group should have led to the pre-quoting, in particular, which causes the Rangers to have all types of problems.
Scott Robinson has demonstrated that he draws your efforts in the face of an article, Alan Lithgow can point out his efforts directly to open up after entering
Restaurants have been pleased to see Rangers playing in front of them, knowing that it would cause problems for the interested visitors.

Scott Pittman has been ordered at the feet of Allan McGregor, a barmaid of the Rangers and Lithgow who has thrown a ball from one of Livingston's players.

Working with the marvelous level and outcome of Livingstone.
To the man. They were outstanding, they continued to admire them for all the expectations they were expected on the neglected route.
Their performance and control have rarely changed since they returned from a standard aircraft, but their reputation is accorded Holt by the way he has played the team as soon as he has arrived.
He had many powerful men.
The guide Halket's crew has had a shape, which is running for the subblysoft, while Menga keeps the Conor Goldson and Joe Worral in their tiny feet all the time.
Rangers were in need of encouragement.
Although they have played well at times under the rule of Gerrad, they have fallen short of the decks.
Their last ball was only short of where they had planned their home-of-in-and-a-in-and-aggregates, which have found them at the center of the table.
Eldogen received a mixed reception in Cologne
It was full of smiles and blues on Saturday (29 September) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany assembled in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of the visit of President Erdogan that can be opposed in Germany that is aimed at correcting the relationship between NATO connections.
It is more than a matter involving human rights, the freedom of the newspapers and the Turkish treaty in the EU.
Erdogan then came to Cologne to open a large moque.
The city is home to most of the Turks again.
The police presented security reasons to prevent 25,000 strong people from meeting before themosque, but many of the supporters have moved nearby to see their president.
Hundreds do not comply with the Erdogan public-most of them are Kurdish-and make their voices ravaging, destroying the operation of the German government and decisions so that the national government will accept them.

Hurriline Rosa interrupts Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with high-water flooding (the drought areas may benefit"
Tropical pressure rarely attacks Arizona, but that may happen directly at the beginning of the next week as Hurricane Rosa plans to travel through the South East Coast, which transmits the dangers of high-water floods.

In some areas of the Southwest Desert, including the centre of Rockies and the Great Basin, it may be possible to gain 1-to-2 inches, and ranges alone to 4 inches if possible.
In these floods Rosa’s rain can be a blessing as it surrounds us with drought - stricken areas.
Although water flow is very important, some rainfall is hard to cope because the Southwest suffers from drought at the same time.
According to the U.S. Dreadnought, more than 40 per cent in Arizona have a much greater drought problem, which is the second highest level. Weather.com

Hundreds of Indonesia were killed by an earthquake, the seemingly constantly - moving Tsunami
There are 384 people killed, many of them being swept away by the surf, where great earthquakes and tsunamis have hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities say on Saturday.
Hundreds of people have been assembled at the Palu Sea station on Friday, where the waves were six feet [6 m] high (18 feet] high in the dry ground, wiped out people because they killed many people and destroyed anything in their path.
The tsunami follows a 7.5-submarine depth depth.
"While the tsunami promised the appearance of yesterday, the people were doing their duties at sea and did not immediately run away and were the victims," Sutopo Pulo Nugroho, the administrator of the Indonesian Ministry of the BNPB Service spoke to him when he gave a comment on Jakarta.
"The tsunami has never gone out alone, to drag motors, blocks, houses, towing everything on earth", said Nucroho, adding that the tsunami had gone through the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before it reached the shore.
Some people climb trees to avoid tsunamis and survive, so to speak.
About 6,700 people have been discharged from their homes to 24 Palu centers.
The Aerial photographed by the minister of emergency services has already shown many buildings and stores destroyed by tsunamis, munitions and fallen bridges and swamped mosques.
The tsunami’s fruitage continued to move the city’s coastline on Saturday.
A number of earthquakes are confined to areas with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Ministry of Test of Technology (BPT) said that in its speech the largest quake was 200 times as powerful as a nuclear explosion dropped on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
Science is native to the City, which dwells at the end of the length, the bottom of the harbor, and may increase the size of the tsunami, the saying.
Negrono described the damage as a "big" and had thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims are reduced to close below the level of the collapsed buildings, they say, and they have said that there are more than 240 persons injured and 29 still are not seen.
Nugroho has said that the victims and damage can be 200 miles [300 km]) to the North Pole, at an area called Dongga, which is near the quake's epicenter.
The connection was completely disabled without details" from Dongga, and Negroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, said the Red Cross in their speech, added that their crew and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It is already a disaster, but it can be more," he said.
The Ministry on Saturday was criticized in the country as a general lack of a Palu tsunami, although the officers had come with a wave during the delivery of the warning.
Photo pictures have been shared on mobile pages in which a man was above the heard building level calling for a desperate warning when a tsunami reaches people and the streets below.
Within minutes the water bank has hit the shore and taken the buildings and cars to a great distance.
The Reuters could not move the picture immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis have caused great electric power to break up the link in the Palu area and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue missions.
Forces have begun importing cans and aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities have said, but those discharged have been desperately in need of food and other necessities.
The city aircraft station has been reopened for only the purpose of helping together and will remain closed until October.
Mongali Yoko Weddi was arranged to visit the services of those who had their homes set aside in Palu.
The All Soars of the Indonesia of Tsunami are over 800.
Some of the Biggests.
While the Dongga World Vision staff in Dongga are safe in the city of Pallu, where the workers are housed in their offices in Tarpaulin, they are past the most anxious events in their area, says Mr. Doba.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
Too bad
And like rescue teams who begin to express strong feelings of trouble, some complain that some of the world’s high - tech aid workers have been banned from driving to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financial support, staff and employment of overseas workers can only begin to travel if the emergency site is declared as a national disaster point.
This is not yet done. has not been accomplished.
"Declaration of the province," says Aulia Arriani, the speaker of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"The President once said, "YACCO., this is a State disaster," we can open it to the Government but still have no degree at present.
As it is the second night in Palu after the fifth earthquake and tsunami, the surviving friends and relatives are still hoping that friends and relatives will appear and that this miracle will leave an unsaid story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was released from the uniform.
The rescuers, in turn, rescued a woman who had been caught in a coma for two days and found her mother’s body in her private yard.
Gemon Subandono, an instructor of the Indonesian national team of paragliding, trained two paragliders on this invisible team for Asia's games, which are scheduled at the beginning of the next month in Indonesia.
Some of those imprisoned at the Hotel in Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandag, were his disciples.
"As a paragliding field, I have a feeling that is heavy to me," he said.
Mr. Gendon has re-counted the way, in the hours following the news of the hotel Roa Roa and traveling among the people, who were busy sending whasapp messages to the Panagadians, and who were taking part in the sea captainship.
His messages, however, are limited only to the gray character, instead of having two corresponding characteristics that indicate reading of the message.
"I think this means that the messages were not sent," he said.

West: Irapper has changed its name, Ye
Rapper musician Kane West has changed my name.
In describing his name change, he wrote to Twitter on Saturday: "It has been officially known that he is One West."
The West, 41, has been called the nickname Ye for a long time and has been using Moniker as the title of his eight-discover, which has gone out of hand.
These changes were made before they were seen on the Light Live on Saturday, where they were expected to continue his new sheet, Yandi.
You have entered the soloist Ariana Grande who has resigned for "for her reasons", says the songwriter.2]
Since this is an adjusted term in the current name, West declared long ago that the name has a role in religious values to him.
"Nindian believes that 'ye' is the most common name in the Bible, which in the Bible is "you", West said that at the beginning of this year, when discussing the title of his recording with DJ radio Big Boy. It is the host general term that was shown in the Bible.

Mexico's AMLO had promised that he would not serve the forces against citizens.
President Andreas Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use private security forces as the country has reached the 50th anniversary of the injury and recompence of students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatolco Plaza that "he will never use forces to oppress the Mexicans."
The forces began shooting at the pre-packaged show on Oct. 2, 1968, killing more than 300 people during the student-based classes in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youths by giving them monthly support to their students as well as to open up a number of open universities to the public.
He said that the lack of recognition and the failure of educational opportunities made young people join gangs.
U.S. funded A.I.
China is becoming more active in uninterruptible intelligence, the U.S. must repeat the time spent in research sections, says the sponsor with the AI projectivationer Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These commissions will come after various sections of the U.S. government have made announcements for AI, such as the U.S.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan this past year: it was aimed at No.1 on the AI plan in 2030.
"The repetition of an AI research college will be an appropriate starting point, as all other countries are later in the U.S., and look at the next design of the AI," says Lee.
Repeating funding may multiply the chances of the next major AI success that will be done in the U.S., says Lee in an interview with the CNBCs this week.
Lee, author of the book "The Supernatural Power of AI: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CO of the Signation Ventures, supporting one of the largest AI companies in China, the Face+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, she worked on an AI policy that struck the most prominent American nobleman Othello plantyer, who was the manager of the Microsot Research Project later, and who had been head of Google at the China branch.
Lee has accepted the previous competition of the U.S. government technology as a Rocket for the Best Security Project Project Projects and has asked when it will occur next, to determine the following criteria.
U.S. researchers must work hard to win government funding, says Lee.
"It is not China to take the leadership of education; it is a joint entity," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technical firms hire qualified university personnel to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that the change of foreign travel police would help to support its AI efforts
"I think the blue card will be automatically given to those who make PhD's on the "AI", I say.
The National Council of China released its Non-Tactical Intelligence Plan in the Next Generation in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation of Nature provides the financial support of students at similar educational institutions as do the National Institute of Natural Science and other government institutions that contribute money to U.S. researchers, but it is lower than China, says Lee.
Early this year in the U.S. Department of Security established the Non-Tactical Intelligence Center, which was designed to involve cooperative groups from production to education, and the White House announced the establishment of the Non-Tactical Intelligence Committee.
And this month the DARPA announced $2 billion as the start of a trial called AI next.
As the NSF, it now has more than $100 million a year for research on the AI.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation intended to create a National Security Commission for the Non-Naturity Intelligence has not yet begun these months.
The Macedonians have voted into repheredom to change the name of their country.
The Macedonians have voted to rephere in the Cape to change the name of the country into the "Ceddonian Northern Region," a movement that will resolve a long ten-year dispute with the affected members who have called values in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, wants its territory around the North to be heard in its own place and closes the entrance to NATO and the EU.
Two governments have agreed on June on the request for a new name, but the Nationalists object to a change of the name that they say undermines the origin and culture of the majority of the Macedonian's Slavs.
President Gjoge Ivanov said that he will not vote for referendom and the company that refused to cooperate is uncertain that the votes would meet the requirements for the 50% of the minimum required to carry out the recommended referundum option.
The question on the refeving ransom reads: "May you be a member of NATO and the EU which accepts a concordat with Greece."
Supporters of word change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price paid is due to the adoption of boards such as the EU and the NATO of Macedonia, which are one of the countries to meet in the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote the future of this country, working for young people here in Macedonia so that they can be free under the protection of the European Union, for it will mean a safe life for all of us," says Olivera Georgijska, 79, Skopjeje.
Although not legally binding, members of parliament have said that they will commit themselves to the results of the vote so that they can make it necessary. 2]
A change of word will require two thirds of the parliament.
The country’s election commission said there were no unusual reports on 1 p.m.
Nevertheless, the present people stood 16 per cent, compared with 34 times the last 2016 election of Parliament, where they were 66 per cent of the votes.
"I am here to vote for my children, our place in Eurpe," said Gjose Tanevski, who had 62, and who would have been in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia for a change of word that would open the way to join NATO and European Union in Strumica, Macedonia in September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament at Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, of 54, repaired a small platform and dragged the chairs that had been set up against the integrity.
"We are both NATO and EU, but we want to join actively, not according to door services" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but are virtuous.
If they don't want to accept it as Macedonia, we can convert the Chinese and Russian countries into a part of the European-Asian union.
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO will bring in the most needed currency in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
‘ I believe that many people will like that because there are more than 80 percent of the people who like Nato and the EU," says Zaveve after vote on the chart.
He said that the "Yes" will be the result of "make sure of our future."
List of votes will be printed on the last Monday by the Macedonian Police Station, between 30 per cent and 43 percent of the votes to participate in the ransom- below the number required for the polling to be successful.
One list of votes, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, was found 57 percent of the people who planned to vote on Sunday.
The majority of participants indicated that they would vote in "Yes".
For the election of refection to be effective, 50 percent of persons and one person above are required.
The failure of the retina will bring the first powerful blow to the pro-Western government police since its taking of the rope in May this past year.

Scherzer wants to play on Spoil vs. Rockies
when the Nationalals sub-conversion was made in a conflict of platoffs, there was no reason to force a re-start.
But a former rival named Sherzer hopes to find a rise in the Cape when he plays with the Colorado Rockies, but only when the results have been drawn on Rockies's bats, which manages the lead level in the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Hemisphere.
The Rockies finish a little with a row-card post where they graduated on 52 Nationals on the 5th night, but they still look at their tag in the first section.

Trump trucks in West Virginia
The President points directly to the position of the person he has chosen in the High Court, Brett Kavanough, while speaking about the importance of the discharge of the Republicans will vote with the medieval choice.
"All we have done can lose it in November.
The remaining five weeks of history are ones that are crucial to our time.
This is a big choice, largely "survivors" and I really don't run, that is what I am everywhere striving to find the right kind of people to make up for it," says.
Trump went on to say, "When you see the bad things of the Democrat class, you see them happening right now.
And they are determined to take over their authority by using whatever means seem appropriate, cruel, unfeeling.
Neither the carer nor the one who has hurt them, who will go over them, to gain the power to control and control, nor the only thing they need in the power to control, will we not give them."
The Democrats, he said, are in the machines on a mission to "responsure and disturb."
"You saw what happened four days ago," said, calling the Democrats "because you are angry with being cruel and callous and not honest."
He is referring to the Senate Committee of the Democratic Sen of Democratic Dianne Feinstein by his name, where he has received greetings from onlookers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you moved in?
Uh, h, what is it.
No, no, I'm waiting for another – it's bad to say about the body that is so bad I haven't seen.
The still special Labour was a double one.
It is not easy to speak up about such talkers
While the Momentum's anticists in my local group voted against me, it was surprising.
After all of that, I am the top of the Labour class to be told that they are not all expressing what they are thinking.
My minister at the parliament received similar treatment from Joan Ryan, who was rather independent of the Jews.
In my case, the situation of criticism and opposition to me was Jeremy Corbyn’s disapproval.
To the important police of the working economic system, the national security, Europe, by looting similar matters where Jeremy disagrees with former leaders.
The Public Meeting Notice With Tittingham East Friends wrote that "We want the meetings to be included and have a proper effect."
For almost eight years with Labour in my community, the five GC meetings on the 5th night were always that way.
Where it is bad today, this modern meeting is not the masterpiece of a meeting that normally has "humane and soft," the political party is forgotten or, therefore, never started again.
It seems to be an increasing variety of opinions that differ with the acceptance of the Labour group and that the whole opinion is checked before being accepted by the pollster.
This begins after Jeremy entered the leadership seat, such as my co-oper and former ex-constitutions, and I was expected to change quickly and take places I would not agree with; either by national security or trade or even by one of the EU.
Whenever I talk openly-and I don't care about what follows the harassment on the man pages is said to be lowered on the seat, not to be accepted by the local politics, I'm told I'm not worthy to be in the Lavour party.
And that is my experience.
Likewise, I know that I am more fortunate than my colleagues as the parliaments direct to me and want them to become political activists.
I respect the skills and commitments of my colleagues who are faced with the daily struggle with sexual or racial harassment but who are unable to get away from them.
One of the most controversial features of politics is its social status.
Jeremy Corbyn explained this past week that the Labour team had adopted the culture of tolerance.
The fact is that it is no longer big and that by the form of "mutchy" or by changing the principles of the group that have become very thin.
I have many suggestions over the past two years asking me to let go, not to speak of the way I talk and then "the whole thing will be good."
But this is no longer a political threat.
Since I joined Labour in the 32th year of the school, being stirred up by the Thachcher government, not being concerned about neglecting the room in which I have been studying, since then I have vowed to fight for the best of the public and those who need it, especially if I have been a rich or executive.
I did not hide my involvement in politics, including the previous election.
No one in the East of Nottingham can be confused by any way about where I stand in my police station, in places where I disagree with current leaders.
In these high conditions now on the fifth, in all cases when Brexit influenced injury to you in homes, businesses, and our public services, I don't understand his desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Body.
Be sure that the one message I have does not go to Nottingham Momentum, to my people, whether they are members of Labour or theirs: I take pride in working under you and promise that there is no value to be exempt from the threat or political help will prevent me from doing what I believe are your best interests all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr ascending
The two later triangles are inclined towards the end of the mains leading to the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves this fine victory for the Tennet's Premiership Day sport.
Now they increase the rate, the main part of the division.
In the end, it was their high - quality protection, as well as their opportunity to take a better chance, which led to the betrayal of the family side and the instructor Peter Murchie.
"We have been tested in our games up to now, and we are not beaten, therefore I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose, says: "Respecting Ayr, do better than we have done."
Grant Anderson was 14 minutes on his try, changed by Frizier Climo, and put Ayr ahead, but, the Scottish Scottish cap card, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the notes for himself and Jason Bagot and tried to change them.
Climo outlined Ayr's leadership with thepenty, before, the half-time of the game, she put the article in it and then changed that try to form 17-5 in Ayr during rest.
However, Melrose has started well over half and the Patrick Anderson' car, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the chance of five points.
It has been said that a long time since Ruaradh Knot, who has had seizures, was replaced by Ayr, has increased rapidly by Stafford McDowall, translated by Climo.
Ayr Captain Blair Macpherson has been given a purple card, and again, Melrose has fined another man with Bruce Colvine’s untranslated truck, under intense pressure.
However, when Struan Hutchinson is given a yellow card because of Climo without a balling line, MacPerson goes to sleep back as the Ayr struck him.
Climo has changed, as it has been almost since it was started again, after Kyle Rowe had packed David Armstrong's balls into the box and sent the flameger Henry until he installed a fifth course.

According to the official record, he is the ruler of the Adriftmorn Limited.

Our sea: Bolivia with hope that the road will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors lie in the cathedral of La Paz.
Public floats wave a blue flag.
The navy's masts from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are bound up with the words: "Our sea is our official sea.
To regain it is our duty.
Throughout Bolivia's closed world, the memories of Chile's coastlines in the war of great wealth and abundance of blood in the 19th century are as vivid as their desire to make their way back to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes have been higher over the centuries, as Bolivia is awaiting a federal court judgment on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bil Bolivia has power, a spirit of solidarity and stability, and wait in a good spirit," says Roberto Calladilla, Bolivia's ambassador.
Many people in Bolivia will hear the judgment of the World’s Constitutional Court on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand up in Bolivia’s four - decade after further discussion and again in Chile when he is forced to consider giving Bolivia a more impressive land into the sea.
Evo Morales, a life - and - descent president of Bolivia who is faced with a severe reelection year - also has much to do with the Monday sentence.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean," confirm what it says towards the end of August.
But some analysts say that no court case on the Bolivian side of non - kento will make such a drastic change.
The United Nations Committee located in the Netherlands-has no power to remove Chile's land, and claims that he cannot know the results of any speech.
The fact that the judgment of the World’s Constitutional Court was issued only six months after a discussion indicates that the case was "free from question," says Pez Zárate, a Chilean legalist.
And instead of supporting Bolivia’s desires, four years may have made them turn back.
"A matter of sea access has been seized by the existing Bolivian government," said Zárate.
Morales ’ defense ended any kindness they still had in Chile, namely.
Bolivia and Chile will talk again one day, but it will be hard to hold discussions after this.
These two countries have not been joined by diplomats since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative of The Hague, has denounced the court as having made an unusual decision.
Monday will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to unveil the new friendly friendly paper with Chile" and the opportunity for "ending 139 years of conflict with profit," he said.
Calcutta also denied the fact that Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - uses this sea as a political base.
"Bil Bolivia will never cease its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," and stop it.
"This judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome things that happened in the past."
North Korea says it will not dispose of nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
Northern Korea High Commissioner Ri Yong Ho says that his country will not be separated from its nuclear weapons first if he does not trust Washington.
Ri was talking about Saturday in the United Nations Constitutional House.
He has asked the United States to follow up the promises made during a conference in Singapore among the top - minded leaders.
With these words, President Mike Pompio seems to be about to start a nuclear exchange that had been dropped more than three months after that of Singapore and Kim Jong Unun, from North Korea.
Ri says that the continuing rise and refusal of the United States is a proposal to end the Korean War will even cause the North to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to this agreement before Pyongngang takes steps to break off these weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump were looking for a second conference.
But many doubt that Pyongyang is willing to give up what the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the following month to prepare for the convention by Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion display shows the latest variety of hats you will see on the streets of a nearby town
If you want to increase the hats you have or want to block the sun, then don't go anywhere else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have begun creating a collection of the most unusual large hats of the SS19 exhibits that have fallen off the deck set in the Paris Cane Week.
These impressive hats have filled the Instaggrams this summer, and the designers have sent their awesome hats to the fair.
Valentino's lone hat is a broad-hand pin and covers the whole head of the captain's clothing.
Other overloaded hats included jewelry, a coat of jewelry, and even a tin - butn, but it was not designed to warm your head.
Then Thomas Browne came in with a series of impressive masks during the course of the Nohepen era.
Many of these colorful masks are more flavored and are more like Hannibal Lecter than are styles that are not worn out.
The other hat is as if to enter the water with a breathing material and throats while the other is like a cylindrical ice cream.
And if you like fashion, you are fortunate.
Those looking at will say that the hats may come from where you live.
These outstanding hats are at the feet of La Bomba', a two-footed sun hat worn by people like Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The book that made these unusual hats that had filled the communications pages has brought another big display of a green bag carried along the coast that is almost as large as a showman in your swimwear.
The Raffia orange bag, with the top ends of the jacquemus - La Riviera SS19 in Paris's History Record.
The famous designer Luke Aritage has told FEMAIL: ‘ I expect to see large hats and beach bags reach people in the next type - as the designers have set them up' will be difficult to ignore the people who will want these extraordinary things.'
John Edward: Important speaking skills of the world’s people
Scotland's private schools have a reputation for academic achievement, and this has continued in 2018 with some of the outcomes of the pre-going examinations, strengthened by individuals and the success of the sports team, art, music and other social projects.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer a high - quality service to both students and parents.
Independent schools endeavor to prepare their students for higher education, private education, and their environment.
As a school curriculum that can design and install a suitable school library, we see the available languages going on as a preferred and required courses at school.
Nelson Mandela himself said: ‘ When you speak to a person in the language he understands, he reaches his mind.
If you talk to him in his language, you reach his vocabulary."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and mutual trust with immigrants.
From the recent results of the test, we can see that languages are high on the table at the highest level of secondary schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign-language students have received the titles of the Higher Grades A.
The data gathered, in 74 SCIS schools, indicated that 72 percent of students had received High-grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students received A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign - language skills that children and young people surely need in the future.
Now languages, such as the study being selected, are equally valued as STEM courses (Science, chemistry, engineering and metematics) in private colleges and other schools.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Promotion and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons given by employers for the problem of hyperactivity, 17 percent is associated with the lack of language skills.
As a result, more and more language skills are needed to prepare young people for future responsibilities.
As more work opportunities require languages, these developments are vital in the working world.
Regardless of the type of employment you choose, if you learn a new language, you will have a future in your life with the same potential.
Being able to communicate with people from other lands has opened up a new possibility for a person who knows many languages.
According to the UK test of You Gov for more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent could speak another language well enough to communicate, and only French is spoken more than 15 percent.
That is why investment in language is now important to children.
A knowledge of many languages, especially those in developing lands, will equip children for a better job.
In Scotland each school will be divided into our mother tongue.
A number of schools will concentrate on the current language of the past, while others will teach languages thought to be of great importance in the UK when viewed in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
No matter what your child likes, there will always be a number of languages that you choose from private schools, and there are also professional teachers in this section.
Scotland’s independent schools are willing to provide an education environment that will equip children with the skills needed to succeed, no matter where they go in the future.
There is no denying, in the world’s business world, that languages continue to play an important role in the future of this world, so this must be seen in education.
In fact, modern languages must be viewed as a "synthesis of the world."
Free schools will continue to offer these choices, separation and resignation to young people in Scotland.
Il free bien lefile.
John Edward is the Director of the Convention for the Independent Schools

Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, You Tube Channel
President Donald Trump begins his long - standing conference this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
The first of Trump’s five scheduled meetings for the next week include a visit to friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As a certificate certificate is established until he is selected to present him to the Supreme Court, Trump tries to cancel the second election support since the Republicans are in danger of losing the Congriss ruling by Nov.
When will the Trump convention in West Virginia be held this evening, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump convention of Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ATT this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the West Virginia Trump convention on the Internet with the film film at You Tube.
Trump is considered to speak at the meeting of this week of the High Court athlete Brett Kavanough, who is in a difficult situation because of charges of misconduct that will be proposed for a week of confirmation while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to withstand the election of November.
As a result, the President Trump’s campaign stated that these five conferences the following week are aimed at "in the strength of volunteers and sponsors as the Republicans try to protect and increase their number in the Legal House and President House," the Reuters report.
‘ Control of the Congres is so important to him that the president will go to as many countries as possible as we approach a busy coffeehouse," the speaker of Tupmp who didn't want to know what the Reuters had.
Written at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this modern fact at night can provide support from "Ohio and Pensylvania and is known in Pittsburgh for its subject," says West Virginia City News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, which the state section defeated by 40 percent over 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia’s Republican Conservative Patrick Morrison, who is behind this election.
"It is not a good sign for Morisey that the president is obliged to refuse support," says Simon Header, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: An American team shows that if you are hungry you will continue to fight as if you were going to go to some kind of game on Sunday.
After three games alone, play as the first four people was the demand for the Ryder Cup.
The top position in any group has given the impression of sports in which the participants believe it, and in the competition like this.
Who is thus described as moving ahead in the meantime?
‘ Pay them six points and now four, so I think we're going ahead," says Jordan Spieth while she goes the same way that day.
Europe took this opportunity, in fact, with 4 points over and 12 others that have not yet been verified.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they are doing well and that they can get a lot of attention, including how Spieth and Justin played well all day and that the couple have three to four notes.
Spieth has always played well since the beginning and paid by example.
When people shout in applause while he roars, he puts the ball in the crucial moment of winning the game after both he and Thomas have been beaten with two notes.
Beating a ball in a win - win hole at 15 causes people to shout the same way, telling you that the American team is losing.
"You have to worry about your game at all," says Spiegel.
They have left behind.
18 holes to mark them.
Players with the top score above Spieth and Thomas in the past two days by Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleet, the opposition story of the Ryder Cup
Europe’s roads make it unique to men and women, and they cannot do anything wrong.
"A couple called "Moliwood" is the one that doesn't beat the bogey on Saturday afternoon and Saturday morning on Friday afternoons and Backs Wine on Friday mornings.
That cooperation, along with their interest, seems to be as beautiful to the crowds as they are for the church to win, and no other popular player can conquer Europe when the sun sets at the Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood and Minnari.
It is best for both to play together at the same time in different places.
The report on European success is still not available, however.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson did the work of Sergio Garcia, a veteran of four balls in the morning, when he got collaborators with Alex Noren.
The Bogey and other two-screw points along with a Spanish hole and a Mudite that they could not get out.
On Sunday, though, no one can help you get out of that hole.
Four footballs and four players are happy to watch them close together because of the interaction of the participants, the advice they give, the advice they give, the advice they give, and how the schedule may change in a short time.
Europe has played better as a group until now and is leading up to the last day, but four players have shown that the American team is hungry for an unlikely, especially Stestide.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take the lead well on the last day of the Ryder Cup after four articles and four sports events that have paid 10-6 Americans.
It is held to the interest of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary to change the game to win the poor Tiger Woods to advance the Gulf National in four steps.
The European case of Thomas Bjorn, seeks to win the rod that defeated them at Hazeltine in the last two years ago, conquering the morning American case with four points, winning a series of games by 31.
America did not accept the four games, but the games, although they had not been able to do so.
Jim Furyk’s side requires 8 percent of the 12 individual sports to receive this gift
Fleetwood was the first European to draw four points and be new at the same time as Munari, called the "Molliwood" after the weekend of the first couple winning four points when the Ryder Cup was opened.
Woods and Patrick Reed are further defeated by Woodsn and the American district of Brysin Dechambeu in 5 and 4.
Woods, who has drawn himself to two Saturday games, showed there and interest but divided 19 of 29 games into four balls and four characters in a row.
Justin Rose is retired in the morning of the four four hours of the morning and with his partner Henrik Stenson in Foursomes and 1 in contrast with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world’s leading leader
Europe did not conquer France any easier.
Three times their father, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas did the best for the Americans to receive two articles on Saturdays.
They gained the victory by 2 more than 1 when playing with the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter to these journalials, and then divided the Poutter and Rory McIlroy by 4 and 3 of the four four sets of the four four four fo'c's crosses.
Twice in the Ryder Cup the team returns from the division with four notes going to individual sports, although Fulyk’s role requires playing without one to win the game.
Two days later, the Sunday attack was over.
The North Korea says that ‘ he will never complete his weapons before he can gain protection.
The director of an international institution in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that these sentences made it unreliable among America and there was no way that America could complete its Nuclear equipment if she could obtain security certificates.
Ri Yong Ho has told the board of those present to take positive steps last year, such as to stop the tests of equipment and to drop the Nuclear installations, and to promise that we should no longer make Nuclear equipment.
"We don't see the corresponding steps from America," he said.
"No promise from America will have any confidence in the security of our country and in this situation we will never lose our weapons without speaking to America."
While Rin reviewing what has been said by North Korea about American refusal to complete the Nuclear armaments by subsections and then rewarded by North Korea for the minor measures they have taken, his report did not deny Pyongyng’s action to eliminate the adverse materials.
R Ri told of a joint report by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first conference between the president of the United States and the North Korean emperor which was held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim offered to work for "Declear equipment instead of Korea" while Trump promised the security of Korea.
North Korea wanted to end the Korean war of 1950-53 in terms of justice, but the American said Pyynyang should first eliminate Nuclear instruments.
The Wahington appeals to reduce the harsh international sentences facing North Korea.
"America forces "the completion of the Nuclear instruments first" and increases the pressure level by orders to accomplish their purpose in a forced manner, against the end of the war," says R.
"The idea that the judgments can frighten us is a false dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that these sentences increase mistrust.
RR did not discuss the plans of another conference for Kim and Trump, of which the American leader spoke before the United Nations this week.
Instead, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean emperor Mon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the team in this case of Nuclear is South Korea and not America, is it possible to complete the Nuclear equipment instead of Korea."
Even so, Ri’s speech sounds different from last year, when speaking to the general U.N. conference that the targeting of North Korea's flying equipment in the United States was inevitable after the "Mun. The Evil President" called Kim "the flying instrument" for suicide.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "put an end to" North Korea, has courageously given Kim a praise for taking action to eliminate the weapons, but says that there is much more work to do and the penalties will remain far away for the Nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no fixed time for that, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongngang for the measures he has taken.
Even so, American secretary - general Mike Pompio told the U.N on Thursday: "The violation of the judgment of the Security Council does not continue with increasing force until we see the total loss of Nuclear equipment."
The Security Council has passed sentences in accordance with North Korea since 2006 for the end of the budget of Pyonyang's flying equipment systems.
Pompeo met Ri over the U.N General Assembly and said that he would visit Pyynyang again for the second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his final visit has not come without success.
She left Pyynyang in July saying that there was some progress made, but North Korea took it off and said that she did "the same needs as the thieves."
The North Korea promised to meet Moon this month so that they could break up the space of the flying Nuclear if America's "actual steps."
When Kim told him that the "intermediate measures" that Trump was promised in Singapore and the development of normal relations with Washington
Harvard students take adequate rest courses
A new study at Harvard University this year enabled all the uncared students to sleep enough to fight the habit of learning throughout the night with caffeine.
One expert found that students at the university do not know anything about their basic needs.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep specialist at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigham and Women's hospital, took this course, they believe that this is the first such type in America.
He was encouraged by his talk about the consequences of lack of sleep during the course.
'When one of his classmates finished the class, one girl came up and said: 'Why am I told that now, will I finish school?'
He said that no one told me the importance of sleep - that amazed me, ’ he told The Telegraph.
This study started this year, explains the benefits of sleeping in connection with the development of education and sports, including improving their general health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a university director of medicine, said that the university has decided to bring this lesson to the student who does not sleep well.
This one - hour study involves a series of delightful activities.
In one section there is a picture of a university bedroom room, where students click coffee cups, curtains, training clothes and books for the purpose of explaining the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects the development of sports.
In one section, participants are told how sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The school map, with its attractive features, encourages its participants to focus on their daily activities.
'We know that it will not change the conduct of the students 'at once.'
Even so, we believe they have a right to know - as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking drums," says educator Czeisler, adding.
The tendency to be hyperactive is still present, he adds, that modern technology and pressure among students is a growing problem.
Maintaining proper sleep should be a device that is not known for combating stress, fatigue, and anxiety, and even avoiding weight gain, as insomnia weakens the brain, making it ever more hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old resident of California who studies in chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler to make a study of the class after attending his first year in Harvard.
He says that the class opened his eyes and encouraged him to make the class available to the whole school.
He hopes that the next step will ask the mobile students to do the same reading program before they enter the competition center.
Czeisler suggests that students think that they make a sleep alarm, as well as waking, and that they should be aware of the dangerous effects of the light on the electric light and the LED light, which can interfere with your daily routine, which can pay for sleep problems.
Rivingston 1-0 Rangers Men Men of Gerrard
The Rangers also encountered a problem while playing on the way while Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrad with one point on an egg (1-0) in Livingston.
The Ibrbox's side of the Ibrex was at first on the way after St Johnstone struck 4-1 February. But the Gerry Holt's team struck Gerrard for the second time in the 18 games, which began to be the commander's being healed of eight points except the running order at the Ladbrokes Premiershipsships, the Heats.
Menga received an article a few minutes old before the half-time and the Rangers's players were not interested.
While the Rangers came down in the sixth place, Livingston rose to the third after it, the Hibernian left it with one point.
Then there were problems coming to Rangers after the Lienesman was treated with head injuries after being hit by a thrown object from the side of the players on the way.
Gerrard has changed a number of old-time players with Ayr in a game before the last of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt continues with 11 of Livingstone's same players who took the same point to the Hearts last week and rejoices in the way his team has beaten their opponents in all manner.
The Rangers have not controlled the game, but Livingstone does more while finding the ball.
He must have played a score in the second minute when a Menga player allows Scott Pittman to pass to the Alllan McGregor stops but the middle player has not found them.
Keaghan Jacobs stole the ball found by Craig Halket, but his partner, Alan Lithgow, was able to open up on the rear plates.
The Rangers did not get the rule, but there seemed to be more hope than beliefs about the third game before the last one.
Allredo Morelos feels that he should get a pencil in half an hour's mark as he and Steve Lawles collided with each other but Steve Thomson did not listen to the complaints of the Colombian athlete.
The Rangers had a chance to kick a ball near the fields before the end of the first stage of the game, but the barmaid of Ibrix Liam Kelly had no problem with the ball picked up by Lassana Colibaly and also by Ovie Ejaria.
When Livingstone got the first article in 34 minutes that was difficult to find, no one would deny that it is truly worthy of them without any effort at all.
Again, Rangers who failed to prevent Jacobs ’ soccer.
Scott Arfield did not act like the Declan Gallagher who passed a ball on to Scott Robinson, who did not feel anxious to succeed Menga.
Gerard made the first change as he turned Coribally into a change for Ryan Kent and introduced results as soon as the player opened the door to Morelos but the star ran away from him.
But Livingston continued to make the crew play the same thing they wanted, and Lithgow and Halket were throwing the ball away again.
The Holt team could get an article at the start of the game, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow put it on the wheels by the head.
One recent gangster, Glenn Middleton, had another case of sentence as he met Jacobs, but he too turned his back on Thomson.
Almanac: Geiger County developer
And now a page from "Send Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, some 136 years ago today, and SATA ... the date scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of observation and measurement of radiation, which was developed by this development of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has also been used in pop culture as well, as it was shown in movies in 1950 known as "Balls of Colonzao," whose curious characters are impossible to become scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?
Rogers: "It is Geiger County, used to search for precious stones.
When you put these things in your ears, you will hear the results of the Atoms emitted by radios.
Evans: "Speak, it really happens now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 36th birthday.
But this declaration bearing his name will live on.

Kane West withholds Trump’s Support in Speech, Carrying a RA-A Praise, After it appears in SNL.
Not Very Good
Kane West received no headway support during the Saturday Light Live after a synopsis brought praise to the American President Donald Trump and said you would enter the election in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, the Grost Town, which he sang with a cap written by Makke America Great, he called a speech against Democrats and repeated his support with Trump.
"Many times when I talk to a white person when they say: "How can you love Trump?
And I say, if I were concerned about race, I would have walked long ago, I said.
SNL began its program with a video presentation in which Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanough’s testimony before the Committee on sexual harassment claims from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not distributed, this West video is in a chat room by humorist Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock was trying to laugh at this video West.
Also, West is angry with viewers by encountering difficulties before he enters near his hat.
"They have used me back.
When they stand, ‘ Don't enter there with the hat that you carry.'
They have abused me!
They were in a submersion area," says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "Do you want to see a sink spot?" That you will wear "superman's garment, since it means what I want to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try to show love.
His talks received no support from the viewer and the SNL staff, said Variety, and someone who said: "All the slides are quiet."

West received support from the head of the TPSA class, the Canance Turner, who wrote to Twitter: "I talk to a very courageous person: I AM AWI SUFFER.
And rector Karen Hunter wrote to Twitter that the West has just "he behaved as if he really isn't there and it's something strange."
"But I have decided not to pay for a person (by buying his music or giving him support for his "ability" ability) which I believe he accepts and produces harmful ideas in my community.
He is free.
We, however, are also," which says we should add.
Prior to the program, this rapper informed his followers in Twitter that he had changed his name justly, saying he was known as "Born West just now."
He is not the first performer to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Peddy.

Light Game of Thorns Kit Harrington speaks of trying to make a man in a dangerous way
Kit Harrington is known to carry a sword as he simulates Jon Snow in the old violent film HBO, Game of Thrones.
But this 31 - year - old preacher spoke out against what many believe about this powerful man, saying that such roles make boys feel obliged to show their strength so that they can get the respect of others.

‘ I feel very difficult, according to my own side, so long as we didn't go well in masculinity?'
‘ What have we taught men as they grow up, about the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that he is responsible for the problem of trying to make himself a man in a dangerous way because of his male role models.
He adds: ‘ What is taught?
What is taught in television, and in the streets, that boys think it’s unfair for them to become men?
What do I think is the most important question at this time?
Because there is clearly something wrong with our boys.
In this interview he even admitted that he would never play the movie again when the coming version ended, saying that ‘ he has finished with wars and horses'.
Since November Kit will be prominent in the animated film Sam Sherpard's True West in the story of the producer of the exhibition industry and his brother, who is a robber.
He says that he thinks that meeting Rose is the best thing that comes from the Game of Thorns.
"I met my wife in this manner, and she helped me find my family and my life from now on," he says.
Rose imitated Ygrette, whose boyfriend, Jgrette, and Kit’s personality as a character character.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new patients
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 82,000 people were affected in the country, says medical authorities.
An estimated 40,000 people were infected in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
Often people are sexually affected, which is different from what is common in the past.
Naturally, many people in China are affected by blood transfusions.
But the number of victims reduced in this way was completely lost, the health officials in China said at the Yunnan summit.
Every year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted to HIV is a real problem for the people of the LGBT in China.
Homosexuality is no longer a factor in China since 1997, but discrimination against the people of LGBT is said to be difficult.
Because this country has such negative views, research has made it clear that men who have sex with 70-90% will marry people.
In most cases the effects are not sufficiently safe in this relationship.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised access to HIV drugs as part of the treatment.
The Maxine Waters attacked information about GOP websites issued by an employee on the basis of custom, there arose a ‘ heavy lie ’ and ‘ to speak non-subsubmarine'
American representative Maxine Waters once a Saturday accused one of his employees of adding personal details to the Republican’s United States toilets in Wipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat suggests that the charges are advertised by experts and Web sites that take their side.
"A lie, a lie and a lot of lies," says Waters in the report to Twitter.
In reports the data released are home addresses and phone numbers of these Americans. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee include Orrin Hatch, Utah.
These findings appeared in the Internet on Thursday, introduced by an unknown person at Capitol Hill at a time instead of the council’s speech about the lack of self-control and the accusations of the lack of proper conduct by the High Court’s chairman Bret Kavanough.
After some time these satellites have cast off Kavanough by means of questions.
Wise Web sites such as the Gate Pindit and the RedSite reported that the IP addresses indicate that the source of the input is from Waters Office" even released Waters's staff, says The Hill.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false," added Waters.
"A member of my staff - at risk because his personal information has been published because of these false charges that are not available - has no responsibility for the removal of these defects.
This groundless charge is absolutely false.
Waters report received a quick criticism from the Internet, including the former secretary of the American executive, Arischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"That indicates that he does not have the degree to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he need not feel angry.
He does not have to fight.
He is not obligated to inquire about the accused’s motives.
Must be calm and calm.
Fleischer would have compared Waters ’ reply with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanough, accused by critics of being so angry with the Thursday blow.
The Omar Navarro, the Republican weeks in line with the election of Waters during the year, also announces his opinion to Twitter.
"Matter stories if true this is," wrote to the Twitter.
In his noise, Waters said his office had introduced the "right authorities and law institutions with false charges.
We will make sure that suspects are exposed," he added, "and they will pay officially for their risky actions to my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Against - defeat truck pocket of Ron Atskissos
For days it is common to look at objects about Brexit when you watch an English - related spectacle and similar to the famous old comedy and warship of the Johnny English - from 2003 and return in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Will you tell the news that we can no longer sell foreign products?
This papal legionist named Johnny English received his license to renew his name, identifying him as a dainturity for non - English observers.
It is indeed the most powerful and varied government activity of the State in contrast with the minority of Clousau, and Mr. Bean, as well as at least one boy in the Chariots of Fire at the opening of London's Olimpions in 2012.
He even becomes the international confidantist Atkinson who has ever imitated the television commercials of the Barclaycards, leaving the controversy where he went.
There are one or two hours on this show that you can watch JE.
I liked this time Johnny English came to the helicopter dressed in front of the security suit while the helicopter struck his hat.
Atkinson's generous sense of humor is interesting, but it is not strong compared with such heavy products as 007 and the Mission Amosssins model that include the current laughter.
These jokes may be seen not for children but for adults, when I speak my part in making fun of Johnny English does not show how much skill compared with Atkinson’s quiet gestures when playing Bean
News in this video shows whether the English are in serious trouble
The Internet dweller had illegally entered the Internet chain of goods, having seen details of all the English achievements that work, until the challenge at work - the relatively small role of Kevin Eldon.
The news passes through a proud high - ranking high official, who is facing a political crisis as follows: Emma Thompson tries to do what is right as he plays Teresa May but the author of the film did not do well when he wrote it.
Her wise counselors tell her that, like all of them, there is danger in getting back on time.
And that is what little - known Englishman Johnny English himself, who has assumed the position of principal teacher in school, is, however, taking the classes of unconventionship, while England teaches in an unusual way how to become smarter than in so many times.
England is sent back to Whitehall and told of the emergency to meet her former friend Bough, who was also playing by Ben Miller.
Bough is the married man, married to the captain of the submarine.
This capable couple in technical tasks are returning to work, and they meet the Ophelia Bullleti of Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, a high - ranking official believes that he can solve the problems of English computers: that wicked man Jason Volts, played by Jake Rayy
England and Bough started such haste: making themselves food suppliers, burning French food station; starting the problems when boarding the Volta class; and England brings an attack while refusing to use the Vartual Reality for studying the interior of Volta's house.
Everything is done in the final sections, though interesting and interesting, rather than the television programs of children talking about all of this.
Common Objects.
As with all the other displays, Johnny English: Do I wonder if this business is a great feature of the English world that can give Ron Atkinson a meaningful role in his abilities?
The task force denies that they make plans for British citizens to work four days but to be paid five
Jeremy Corbyn’s work team set up a plan to get employees to work four days a week — but paid five days ’ wages.
According to reports, the group requires company management to pay off employees when companies work with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) for giving them a day.
This change will allow workers to have the same pay on a three - day weekend.
The sources say that this plan will be ‘ well suited ’ with the economic ideas of this group and the country’s development plan to take part in the
Switching to a four - day week creates support for the Trade Union Congress as a means of taking part in economic changes.
The high source of the Labour Party tells The Sunday Times: ‘ System monitoring is expected to be introduced before the year passes.
‘ Not immediately, but the four-day work week is the ideal idea for this economic class to be alongside the employees and the business plan of the group.'
The task force was not the first to give support to such an idea as this, and the Green Party made a four-day schedule while strengthening the vote support for 2017.
This program does not at present get full support from the Labour Party, however.
The speaker of the Service Committee said: ‘ The week of the four days of work is not a team policy and it's not something to take into account.'
A deputy director, John McDonnnell, used a previous job conference to explain his position on an economic translation that helps people.
Sir McDonnell says that he is determined to take up the strength of ‘ rulers who don't want to be seen' and who ‘ win' in big business.
The service officer's schedule says that water-packaged operators have not received their assignment as the service government could pay ‘vow' that they do not do well.
He reaffirmed his plan to put employees in positions of management in business and to make a joint fund of money for the purpose of giving the employees a 10 percent share of nongovernmental trades to give them as much as £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI could change their thinking
The FBI investigation of the charges laid down by judge Brett Kavanough delayed the last receipt by his being taken to the High Court each week, and raises the question if the results of the investigation of this center can change the extent of the situation of the Republicans to change their mind with the support they give.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, announcer of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the bursed Presbyterian John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that could cause them to close their minds.
Kennedy felt comfortable talking to her friend from South Carolina.
"Yes," says Kennedy.
"I will go into the pit, and I will speak to the judge Kavanough."
I called after this thing has been discovered, after the charges have been issued, and said, ‘ Have you done this? ’
She was calm, confident, not afraid.
It seems, though, that Graham’s will will never change.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanough and a heavy whistle," says.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I do know: Brett has made a strong denial of these songs," plus Graham, speaking to Chrisine Blasey Ford.
"And every one who speaks of him can verify these charges.
36 years
I can't see the change.

But at 12 years of age, how successful has the Global Citizen been in accomplishing its purpose?
Is it good to give people free of charge the right way to process support - people feel they are making a difference by signing online protests or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has reported that it has forgotten 19 million acts by its supporters, considering various motives.
It said that these actions have helped to encourage the world’s taxpayers to make reports of commitments and financial policies beyond the $37 currencies that will be responsible for the lives of these 2.25 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the team described the commitments and 3690 reports for their actions, 10 billion dollars was spent.
This group claims that their income has helped nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of these commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a cooperative institution of the U.K for the purpose of "helping children grow to this level," the institution promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help them achieve malnutrition in that country after they received 4,200 messages from the Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, of international government and the global Citizens like you, we can be able to resolve the injustice of malnutrition," says the representative of The Power of Nutrition Ullman, informing the multitudes of the social event in London in April 2018.
The team said that after some 5,000 actions asked the U.K to improve the nutritional health of mothers and children, the government had introduced money to cope with the problem, in The Power of Nutrition, which would help mothers and children provide food.
When they answer one of the most commonly asked questions on the Internet site "What make you think we are able to solve serious problems?"
The Global Citizen said: ‘ It's a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and lose.
But as a human rights translation and the struggle for dissimiation in front of us, we will succeed, for we are stronger when we are around others.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and others to entertain you at the New York annual party, which will be welcomed by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.

America can find protection under a navy for the purpose of preventing Russia from selling electrical energy, including in the Middle East, explains U.S. secretary of Internal America, Ryan Inten as The Washington Examiner.
All of them are charged with Russia’s responsibility in Syria - where the government’s official policy for surveying new methods of power power.
"I believe that their goal of being in the Middle East is to trade other countries as Europe has done in Eastern Europe, in the belly of South Europe," says.
And, according to the officers, there are ways and powers to cope with it.
"America has the power, by the navy, to make sure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to prevent them, to ensure that their power does not go to the market," he says.
All were talking to the participants at a party approved by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "in the voice of electric power" in America.
He then compared the methods America faced with Russia and Iran, saying they have not changed.
"The economic choices in Iran and Russia, are almost, raising the costs and replacing oil," says, while calling Russia for a single power mine.
The report appears after Trump’s efforts to promote exporting of water into Europe, Russia’s new land, without the highest prices among Europeans.
As a result, officials of Trump’s government, including the American President Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the "unjustly" work of the Nord Stream 2, according to Trump, the task has done to Germany "prison" of Russia.
Russia has also said that this North Stream 2 billion-million, will double the current one to 110 billion cubic miles, is a good job beyond the economy.
Russia claims that American opposition to the work has economic implications and that it is an example of poor competition.
"I believe these forces should not be a force for pressure, and the buyers must be able to select the merchants," says the Russian Minister Aeksandr Novak after the conference of American Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow on September.
America’s position in this situation was not well accepted in Germany, which has confirmed its determination to do this work.
The leading department of this industry, the National Institute for German Business (BDI), has required that America move away from the EU forces and contracts concerning Germany and Russia.
"I have a big problem when the third world interrupts our power." says Dieter Kempf, head of the German Business Department (BDI) after a meeting with German chief Angela Merket and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

An American ambassador blames China for ‘ exploiting ’ using ‘false ads'
A week later an official newspaper in China published a four - page newspaper advertising every day about the advantages of American trade in China, an American representative of China accused the country of using American journalists to deliver false information.
American president Donald Trump last Sunday spoke of a Chinese Daily advertisement in DesMoines Register - the supreme newspaper Iowa - stop to accuse China of its intent to violate the purity of November 6, which is a controversial Chinese accusation.
The Trump charge that China is trying to interfere with the election is what American officials tell Reuters that a new field of development is under way for America to exert pressure in China.
While it is common for governments of various countries to install commercials to promote trade, China and America are currently struggling with trade and increasing costs.
China adds prices back at the start of the market crisis and is designed to affect foreign stock dealers in government orders such as Iowa who support the Republican Trump team, says Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American representative in China and the Old governor of Iowa, selling to China a large portion of the food crops, said, China has damaged American employees, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes his opinion on the Des Moines Register, "is now determined to exploit it by putting false ads in our remote newspapers."
"When spreading false news, the Chinese government puts himself at risk of hearing America using its usual custom of free speech and free publicity and publicity in Des Moines Register," writes Brandon.
"In contrast, in the news section here at Beijing when you go down a street, you will find little different opinions and will never see how the Chinese really think of China's economic development, we think the news-medias are under the Chinese Communist party, writing.
He added that "one of the most common single newspapers has denied his request to publish this article" even if he does not say where the newspaper is.
The Republicans chased disabled persons before the election of a satellite against Kavanough’s problem, warns analysts
Like the high - ranking Republicans standing next to the High Court’s kidnapman Brett Kavanough and protecting him from his accusations of sexual abuse, analysts say they will see improper springs, especially on the people round, in this coming election of the first half.
Feelings about this situation have been overwhelming, and the Republicans are again saying that they want to continue the election.
You can't go back," says Grant Reeher, a university professor of chiropraciology at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, telling The Hill when an article was published on Saturday.
Reeher assumes that the final attempts of Jeff Flake (R-Arina) to initiate the FBI research if it can change the opinion of angry voters.
"Surrounding people will not soon forget what happened tomorrow - won't be tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and public speaker of the advancing Moveon team on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper of D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters were again saying, "Come on November!" walking on the concrete platoon as the Republic governed the Justice Committee and decided to continue with Kavanough’s kidnapping despite the doctor's testimony, says Mic.
‘ He's interested in freedom and comfort," says Stu Rothenberg, an neutral critic, informing this news agency.
"People have begun to say that you are up right now, this is true.
But there can be much more, especially for people who have not yet made a decision about who will vote and who are young votes, 18-2 years old, who, although not inclined to the president but not normally vote.
Even before Ford’s public evidence of the accusations against the High Court of sexual abuse, analysts say that there can be negative consequences when the Republicans require confirmation.
"This has turned into a problem with the GOP," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republic National Committee last week at the beginning, according to NBC News.
‘ It doesn't matter whether the committee's vote or the last vote or whether Kavanough enters the cabinet, as well as the way the Republics are dealt with the situation and the handling of them," states Guy Cecil in this news agency, the administrator of the Proorities USA, the company that assists the Democrats.
Even so, the churches seem to have little understanding about whom they can believe between the evidence of Ford and Kavanough, although there are few others who take sides in the latter.
Forty percent of those participating in one survey showed that they probably believe or fully believe the evidence of Ford, while 35 percent indicated that they may have full faith in it or fully believe in Kavanough's.
In addition, 38 percent who thought that Kavanough could be or cany make sure that he was lying when he gave a witness, at the same time only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Folk’s interest is aroused, the FBI investigates against the charges brought by Ford and another slanderer, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
Ford reported on the statements made before the justice committee last week that Kavanough had abused him sexually in 18 years when he was drunk by Kavanuagh.
Ramirez accuses that this High Court’s captive revealed her private parts to him when they were at a gathering in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
The Internet producer has developed a plan to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the Internet producer, starts a new business with the aim of competing with Facebook, the Amazon and Google.
This technological device has a new Inrupt system, a business that produces a Solid system available to anyone.
The Solid allows its users to choose their details from the location and who are authorized to see the details.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Bernards-Lee has discussed for the purpose of Inrupt as "Supernational Control."
"We have to do it now," speaking of this business.
"minutes"
This process in technology allows people to create a "Legorical Archive" or PED.
It can include a list of telephone numbers, a list of all the things you are obliged to do, a calendar, your music, and other personal and work activities.
It is similar to having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify in the same place at the same time.
Different from this storage area is the choice of a user as to what one can see.
This company calls you "a personalized."
Inrupt, says chief executive John Bruce, to bring up the weapons, systems and abilities that match to make the Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a system purchased by IBM, personnel promoting the process and the society of volunteer producers.
Since this week, the international technology industry has been able to develop the same method by using the use of Internet sites.
Berners- Lee said he and his team speakers "Facbook and Goodle about whether he has made major changes that might make their business stop immediately.
"We will not ask their permission.
"Berers-Lee wrote to Medium on Saturday that the purpose of Inrupt's "to provide an interest in businesses and places which will help to protect the integrity and integrity of the new planet created by the Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet while creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners- Lee has become an influential voice in this case of Internet neutrality.
When officially opened Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the creator and administrator of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Center and the Open Data Center.
"I'm happy through this new Internet section," plus Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross instructor at WW1
The first and last week of the discovery of the Victoria Cross during the World War II.
Lt. Col. Cardinal Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 18 in 1918, during the invasion at Balling English and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, he was killed by a long - range fireman who died, not knowing that in four days he would receive the highest prize in Britain.
A monument was opened by two of his grandsons in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, pointed out that the stone’s form is not easily forgotten because it was produced 100 years after his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Van paid his subordinate men to pass through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in heavy fog and with heavy guns and machine guns."
Later he fled to those shootings and bravely took those big guns and machine guns alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German who carried a long - range gun gun gun on October 4, 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says that his grandfather's actions are ‘ a thing he knows he will never be able to do, but he said it is humble.'
He and his brother Dr James Vann recorded a history made into a circle after he was in the Brentop Imperial Youth Bank.
Michael Vann says he feels "responsible as he has played a part in the march" and adds that "the courage of the true hero will be displayed by many people who give support."
IMMA sponsors did not sleep to see Bellator 206, but only Peppa Pig
Consider now, for example, the goal of viewing Bellator 206 just to meet up with him.
San Jose’s system has already had 13 wars, including six that are distributed at night on Channel 5 in the UK.
On 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rary MacDonald, the UK observers were amazed to see the changes taking place in Peppa Pig.
Others are as disappointed as these sitting all night until the morning to see the battle.
Another follower described this change that played animation as a bad laugh
"The government policy if since 6 a.m. the procedure was no longer appropriate as a result they had to change to what was not seen with the children," says the president of the Advertise and communications officer Bellator, when asked about what happened.
"Pepepa the pig," yes."
Bellant President Scott Coker said they would change their times next so that the UK's observers also watch.
When I think of playing it again, I think it would be possible," says Corker,
"The problem if it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, we'll not be able to do it until Sunday on Mondays.
But we also bring up a plan
I believe it's, when it changes through many commands, and it’s all unhappy.
We tried to correct it, first thinking that our machine problem was happening.
But otherwise, it was the State’s problem.
I promise you that he will never return.
We are going to reduce five wars rather than the x - as part - and have tried to bring more than they expected but to say that we did more.

Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley feels ‘ small ’ because of his sex
The Hummer Tom Daley says that he has grown younger because of his sexual appearance - but has been interested in his success.
This 24-year-old man says I have seen from the second grade that I am ‘ very different from other people. ’
Commenting on the first practice of the Desert Island Discs run by Lauren Laverne in Radio 4, he says that he mentioned the rights of homosexuals to give them "hope."
She has paid her parentage to stop pursuing the Olympics.
Kisty Young, a normal manager of the system, has heard of months when he is ill.
To appear as a person cast off at the first Laverne conference, Dley says he felt that he was the youngest in his old age because it was "unable to love girls."
He said: ‘ Until this day, feelings of narrowness and dissimilarity are the things that interest me and the strength to succeed. ’
He wanted to prove himself "it is something," he said, so that he wouldn't embarrass everyone if they found out about his sexlike nature.
This winner who won the two Olympic championships has publicly declared the LGBT and has used his reputation this year for the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to make a fair game.
He said that he felt good for being able to live without having to face problems and want to give others "hope."
This world Conqueror had fallen in love with a man - an American producer of a show in 2013 - he was "unexpectedd."
Dale has married this Oscar victory, older than she was in the last 20 years, but that the separation was not a problem.
"When dealing with such things as you are young" - you go to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died from cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age who faced the same life problems.
This couple became parents in June, they found a boy whom they named Robert Ray Black-Galey, and Daley says ‘ all his ideas' have changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to ‘ get a gold medal, ’ he said.
"You know, there are great things to finish the Olympic gold rods.
My Golden club Robbie.
Her son has a name similar to that of his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
“ My aunt never gave up on me, and she asked if they had a London lottery ticket in 2012 - because she wanted to live, ” recalls Dale.
"I couldn't say ‘ you' won't be in the front line, I'll say.
‘ I would hold her in her hand when she was finished breathing and saw that she could not breathe, I said.
The following year Stanley competed in the 2012 Olympics and found a copper medal.
‘ I could see that this was what I had always dreamed of — splashing in the water before the multitudes in the Olympic sport, I could not feel better, ’ says.
It also caught her interest by saying her first proud, a song by Heather Small - always cheering her up in front of the contestant, and it frightened her.
The Desert Island Discs is discovered in BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is put in a battery on the Ryder Cup game that Saturday
Mel Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Lover Cup game but has to change his performance so as not to make this unpleasant record.
Mickelson, who plays the double - annual 12th anniversary, is put on the lap by Captain Jim Fulsk in a four - game game game with four players.
Instead of being watched by the crowds, as is the custom in playing the American game, this winner of the winner spent half of his day without playing and then trained to correct the problem.
The eight - year - old player is not good enough to play in the Le Golf National, where the grass is available and makes it difficult for players to hit the ball badly.
If the playing field itself is frightening, Mickelson, at the ninth Sunday game, faces a Frenchisco Molinari who beats the most magnificent British Open ball, who has collaborated with student Tommy Fleetwood to win all their games in the park.
If the Americans, less than 4 points. If they can properly start 12 games walking alone, Mickelson's game would be more important than that.
Fulyk expressed confidence in her husband as expected.
"She fully understood her role today, hit me a little back and grabbed my arm and said she would be ready tomorrow,"
"Real confidence."
You have found room for the famous auditorium and have added much to these groups in the past time, and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought you would play more games, but they did not go the way we thought they would.
He wants people to know him, like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo’s record of many games in the Ryder Cup in the Church game.
It may make a decision for his play in the Ryder Cup that does not differ from his personal record.
Mickelson has won 18 times, divided 20 times into some of his own, and whereas Fulyk said that his presence was an invisible event in the group.
"You are funny, funny, humory, quick answers, you like to make fun of people, and you're a good person to be with you in the gang room" to explain.
"I was amazed to see young players laughing about him this week and it's a pleasure to see that."
It offers much more than just fun."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that speed may be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European president, knows that the lead position can be quickly lost as this group is ahead of the Ryder Cup but may change at any time.
This colour started playing in Valderma in 1997, where the role paid by the Sve Balles was five points ahead of America but was buried later, winning in 1411⁄2-131 eight.
"You will tell yourself that you have many articles in Valderma; you have many points in Brookline, where it is carried along with Valderma, where we won, hard," by Bjorn, pictured, after viewing the 2018 class victory on 5-3 Friday and the same in paragraphs 10-6 of Le Golf National.
History will therefore teach me and everyone in the group if this is not done.
We will spend everything we have tomorrow
We will do all we should.
This has not yet been completed until the marks on the board have been completed.
It is with a purpose in mind, and it is to try to overcome the stick when it is aimed at us.
I've said it again, I'm looking at the 12 characters on my side, but we know who we are facing anything in the same case as the rest of the world."
Excited by the way his players played in this difficult game, Bjor added: ‘ I never really thought of this.
The next day we will speak about something different.
The next day the individual play ability is checked, and that is the opposite.
It is a challenge to have a mate where things are going well, but when you are alone, you are the first to be tested as to your strength.
That is the message that all players must demonstrate by tomorrow.
Now, you don't come with your partner also must prove yourself."
Unlike Bjorn, man Jim Furyk has been looking for his players to play well alone and not as a group, except Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who receive three to four notes.
Fulyk was once the two sides of the last day's revolutions, she was on the side of Brookline in victory and while being subjugated as Europe did the "miracle at Medinah."
"I remember everything he says," in reply, "Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, how did he put interest in them as they came to the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but we don't have to bear that in mind as you saw it in Brookline and Medinah.
When you start winning every time you start, it puts stress on the balance.
We organize our players in order and put them in a way that will have good results, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to pay for the war and to face Rory McIlroy in the upper sport, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulterhu at the upper level.
"I go with this group of men with this schedule because I think they are responsible for everything," says Bjorn in this choice of individuals.
The German warship has been launched again.
A new German ship should be released in 2014 to enter the position of warships known as the Cord War, but the following year she will not be released because of the problems of the ship and the cost, says the news reporters.
The release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a freighter developed by Baden-Wuetmmberg-class frigates, was postponed by the first half of 1920, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, says the military spokesman.
The ship should not have joined the navy in 104, but the arrival of the cargo has done so.
These four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg in 2007 will also be replaced by Bremen ships.
It was known that there would be a great powerful weapon, as well as weapons of fire and aircraft and other technology that made it invisible to Radar, infrared and autics.
Also important if it takes a long time before it needs repair - it can go on for two years away from home.
However, ongoing disturbances make these new ships - which are said to give German power abroad and become obsolete when power is exerted.
This naval vessel was launched in the past year, while the German navy officially opposed throwing the ship back to Bom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned to the ship's ship after being launched.
Little is known about the reasons for returning the ship, but German reporters say there are problems of "the machinery and goods" that have made the ship effective, which has made the ship useless in the war.
The machinery is more efficient as the ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg is used by 120 people and even half of the people who are forced to use the old Bremen.
Also, it seems that the ship is too heavy to reduce her ability and that the navy will not be able to improve in the future.
This 7,000-ton ship, "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to survive two times more than such ships were used by the Germans in the second world war.
Despite goods that do not work, the costs of all this work - plus the educational costs that are employed are being put to use as a problem.
It is said to have reached about £3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from 1.8.2 billion.2 billion
The problem of these new ships is important when it is pointed out that the strength of the German Navy is diminishing.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the officer of the German Security Committee, admitted that the navy was "lost of warships."
The officer says that the problem has grown older as the years have continued, since older ships were discharged from the navy but no new ones were installed.
He then said that no other ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg was able to join the navy.
The New Trust records of flying creatures such as storks
A new excavations made in Scottish Highlands want to explain how the animals use their environment to obtain food.
It is hoped that the results will enlighten us about the behavior of these animals and how they can be protected.
This is a scientific presentation made by Scottish National Trust, which will follow these familiar animals, which make the sounds like soprano, with long ears and Daubentons at the Invewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording machines will be placed in important positions in this area to indicate what they are doing during the year.
NHS staff and volunteer workers will make a decomposition of machinery that they carry with them.
Audioists will check the recorded sequences to show their calls and what this type of behavior does.
A home map of these little ones and a report will be made to depict the animals ’ behavior.
Rob Dewar, an environmental safety consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will be that seeing these animals come in whatever way they like the environment and which types of locations are used.
These details will help us to see what benefits are available to protect wildlife habitats and how we can conserve wildlife habitats.
The presence of animals in Scotland and UK has declined a hundred years ago.
They are at risk because of the construction and development of habitats.
Airborne and light can put the animals at risk, along with flying newspapers and chemicals from buildings, as well as attack by cats.
These creatures are not blind.
Even so, the main demand for daily food is greater for their ears than for their eyes when it comes to catching food.
They find their food in an angry way when they come back to their ears and can see what they are eating or what preventing them from flying.
NTS, responsible for over 270 old areas, 38 important gardens and 66,000 acres [6,000 ha] of the world, assume that these animals are important.
It consists of ten trained professionals, making revisions, surveying their living quarters, and sometimes rescues.
The center has created an exhibit in Scotland in Threave on Dumfries and Galloway, with eight species of animals
The head of the area, David Thompson, says that this is a suitable place for them
"Here in Threave we have a beautiful place for these animals," says.
"We have old places, old trees and beautiful living quarters.
There is so much that you can know about animals unknown to man, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us explain what they need to live.
He says that the value of testing these animals before you take care of them is important, since harm can result in 400 children’s loss of children and folds, which can cover every part of that type of surface.
The animals are safe and illegal in suicide, which they exploit with their own resources.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of Scotland's Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: ‘ There is still much to know about these animals and many species we don't know of.
Ronalo has answered accusations for fraud and has even sent his lawyers to destroy a German magazine
Cristiano Rolando called the rape charges false, claiming that people want to make their name known.
His attorneys will launch the German news agency Der Spiegel, which is responsible for the charges.
Portugal and Juventus allegedly raped an American madman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in 2009
Then, it is said, he spent $37,000 to keep silent about the event, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking of the Instalgram which spread to his 14.2 million followers after just a few hours of these charges were made, Ronaldo, 33 years old, dismissed himself as "false."
"No, but, only, nothing, but, nothing.
What they have said today, a lie at all," this Ballon d'Or's fifth saying to the camera.
"They want to make themselves known to men on the basis of my name.
It’s normal.
They want to be identified by my name, but it’s now common.
I’m happy and ready," the player adds, laughing.
Ronalo's attorneys are ready to launch the Der Spiegel on these charges, which they say "an unconventional report of the assault on personal life," according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schertz says that the player wants to let go of "the loss of spirituality due to the abuse of personal rights in past years."
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a hotel called Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a drinking club, Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have taken to the theater, where they rape him back, according to paper posted on the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell on his knees after this incident and became "a good man" "99 percent" the problem is the same per cent.
According to the agreement, Ronaldo made sure that the couple stayed together, but they agreed.
Mayorga says that she went to the police officers and took pictures of their injuries in the hospital, but later they agreed to talk one another out of court because she was afraid of returning and worried of being humiliated.
The 34 - year - old says that he now wants them to go back because what he said Ronalddo is still hurting him.
Ronaldo was about to enter the Real Madrid from Manchester United when his charge took place, and this summer he went to the great Italian group Juventus to sell for as much as £100 million.
Brexit: UK will ‘ regret it forever ’ for losing car manufacturers.
The UK "will regret it forever" when it loses its leading role in producing motors after Brexit, says electronic secretary Greg Clark.
Add this to the concern that Toyota in the UK has told the BBC that Britain can travel through the EU after a chat will stand a little longer to set up in their firm at Burkinaston, near Derby.
"We need a combination," says Mr. Clark.
This car producer from Japan has expressed the threat of slowing the flow of clothing off the border when no connections in Brexit would be completed.
The Buurnaston product - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis – has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90 percent of the optical vision is exported to the European Union.
"My risk is that if Britain moves on the EU when Mash is finished we will see the display stop at our production," says Marvin Cooke, the administrator of Toyota in Burkiston.
Some UK manufacturers have expressed their fear of traveling through the EU without links, including the Honda, BMW and the Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Oxford output for a month after Brexit.
Serious anxiety about this can pose a risk to trade when there is no connection with Brexit.
The Toyota screen is conducted with the "time" system, with motor goods arriving every 37 minutes from merchant sources from the UK and the EU for the purpose of producing cars at once.
And while the UK travels in the EU without any combination on 29 March, there can be a disturbance to the limits in which the industry claims to have delays and insufficient clothing.
Not if Toyota has clothes that fit in the Derbyshire project, this is the business, and the explosion is going to stop.
Sir Clark's plan of Theresa May and association with the EU has been "for the purpose of not encountering this check problem in the border."
"We need a connection. We need a very good combination that will allow us to take this opportunity," tells Radio 4 of BBC on the application called Today.
"A testimony not only from Toyota but also from other producers explains that we need to continue where we have been through a fully successful development."
Toyota has not appeared for how long the alarm will last, and has warned that the rising costs will reduce the ability to compete in time after you finish the job.
Peter Tsoullāris, who has worked for Burkinaston for 24 years and has absorbed Unite in this part of the program, says that they are concerned again. "The time I have worked, I know I will never return"
A government spokesman says: ‘ Tell us a reliable plan about future cooperation with the EU.
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed, says the American president’s office
The important Dalald Trump conference and the general ambassador Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week as the contesting of the higher court commission Brett Kavanough continues, says the president.
Rosenstein undertook the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who conducted an investigation of the Russian election, as well as a convention between the Trumps and Russia and the disruption of the legal arm by the president
The fact that Trump throws him away and does not expel the general lawyer, endangering Mueller’s independence, has been the cause of many Washington gossiping in the past months
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein said that he would wear an item to record a discussion with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by mold 25
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But on the last day he went to the White House House, among the reports he would turn off.
Rather, meetings together
Trump said he would not ‘ choose ’ to dismiss Royentein but the conference delayed to avoid confrontation in the Committee of the Committee hearing where Kavanough and one of the sexually charged prosecutors, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of them have witnessed.
On Friday, Tump has authorized a single week's investigation of the FBI with an appeal against Kavanough, which has somehow called for the full Senate's vote.
Trump news writer, Nsz Sarah Sanders, appeared in the Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein conference, he said: ‘ If it was not used, otherwise this week, I saw that a week after a week is given all other things going on in the high court.
But we will see and always want to keep thepress updated.
Some researchers disagree with this: The Sanders did not drive the White House line since 10 September.
Traitor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of arguments was not due to the interruption of the TV commercials of "main," although he said: "I would not agree to look."
You made sure to contact directly between the Trump and the scrollpress.
"The president creates Q&A sessions and sessions instead of any president before," he added without reading the evidence: "We are viewing these numbers.
The reports are going to take place, Sanders said, but "if the printer has the opportunity to ask the American president directly questions, it is better to talk to me.
We try to do so and have seen him do a lot of good in the last few weeks and will take the place of the printing statement when you can talk to the U.S. president.
Trump always does questions when leaving a White House or taking part in an open session or connecting open meetings with talks.
Solo news conferences are a disaster.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, he made a freeheeling and certain invisible periods before meeting the news.
The health secretary writes to the EU staff in NHS Scotland about Brexit
The Secretary of Health wrote the EU from Scotland to NHS to express their appreciation for the country and wish to stay in Post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP has sent a letter less than six months to the far distance the UK has turned it off from the EU.
The government of Scotland has dedicated itself to meeting the expense of the EU environment applications for public services.
In his letter, Mrsz Freeman wrote: ‘ With this type of time, the conversations between the UK and the EU in departure have continued, leading to the expected decisions in the fall.
But the UK Government has compiled its plans as to an unlikely situation.
I know this should be a very disturbing experience for all.
That is why I want to regain my appreciation for the contribution made to the whole crew, regardless of country.
Brothers from all over the EU, and above, bring out the important experience and skills that enhance and improve the medical service, and benefit the patients and the people we are using.
Skotland is your living thing and we want you to stay here. "
Abercrombie Chris Ingos Surgery Emergency After Hearting Head Injury
Tennetsee State Thebackback Chrisy Abercrombie was elected immediately after the attack of the head on Saturday 3127 in Vanderbilt Commodores, reports by Mike Organ.
The lecturer in State Head of Tennessee told the press that it was possible to get injuries soon before a short time.
He reached the line of the side and fell down, says Reed.
The trainers and medical staff offer Abercrombie on the track before laying her on the platform and bringing her back a test.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was not opened to Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that there is no "verification of the type/ size of the damage currently" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when injury occurs.

Salaries will be paid when they buy a UK property
The foreign buyers will be paid when buying the UK property and additional funds used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
The rise will reduce Corbyn’s efficiency of driving to attract lower votes.
The increase in station work will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Fund is expected to rise to £20 million annually to help the homeless.
Those who buy other markets are used to pay for the high value of the UK-sanding equipment in the UK - and additional funds used to help the homeless, Theresa May will bring them today.
The rise will appear to be an attempt to reduce the performance of Jeremy Corbyn Dr.
The increase in station work will be paid by individuals and non-spacing firms in the UK, as well as additional funds for the development of Russia in the fight against sleeping.
Additional fees to modern pumps, including high levels installed two years ago in two homes and the purchase of rent, may be about 30 percent.
The Fund is expected to raise to £20 million annually.
An estimated 13 per cent of new buildings built in London are purchased by the UK population, conducting costs and making it difficult for the original buyers to get a foot at the level of the house.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly capital - have become "the village" because of the high number of foreign customers who spend their time in this country.
A new policy comes in weeks after Boris Johnson asked that the stamp be cut out for the benefit of new homeowners.
He persecutes large firms in building up high - value property costs by exporting land but not using it, and urged Mrsz Mei to stop the platforms from the homes that are purchased to repair the British "house scandal."
Sir Corbyn has brought up a list of proposed house - repair restores, including rent control and desalination.
He also wants to give many great committees to build new homes.
Msz May said: ‘ Last year I said I was going to give your premiership back to the British dream - that life might be better for each new generation.
And that means repairing our real - estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to stay, work, and build life here.
Even so, it would not be appropriate to make it easy for UK blind people, and for outside companies, to buy homes as hard-working British citizens.
For most people the dream of a homeowner has been a long way off, and the destruction of a painful sleep remains a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My top chest is controlling Scotland'
Sunderland Chief Jack Ross says that his "high desire" is to be the Scottish Captain at a certain point.
Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of rebuilding the North-east sub-cultub, now occupying the third position in the League One, three put it on top.
She moved to the Stadium of Light in this short period after leading St Mirnen to the Premiership of the Scottish Season.
I want to play my country like a toy.
I have B bulls and this, "Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports.
‘ But I grew up looking at Scotland in Henden more and more as a child, and it remains my protection.
That opportunity will come, however, if I succeed in mastering the club."
Sunderland chiefs include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio
The former general of Allo-Athletic says that he did not have the courage to follow the complicated names in a large workshop, which has already discarded parts from Barnsley and Ipswich City.
"Security to me during this time will be followed 'Will I restore this module to the Prince of the League?'
As a result of the building and facilities for this game, no doubt in the Premier League, he said.
'It' isn't easy to find it there, but probably I'll just look at if I succeed here to return to the group.
Ross for only three years in his personal handling, after a time as a helper to Dumbarton and 15 days in Coachingstaff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the third entry, and changed St Mirnen from the Championship level in the following respect.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable at the time he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It was possible to be real," in memory, by taking Alloa.
"I really believe that the rule is good for me, more than to play.
It sounds so good because I did well, made a good life in it, and enjoyed it from a high level.
But playing can be challenging.
There are many things that you have to do each week.
I still continue that way in terms of the stresses and pressures of the work, but the control feels correct.
I always wanted to control myself, and now I do that, feeling that I am free to be in my bag for the rest of my life of the elders.

The complete time for the pin is 5.30pm on Saturday, the investigation sees.
The type of heatwave has encouraged the removal of heavy British bridges but more concentrated in eating stores.
Pub and bar groups saw the sale of 2.7 percent on July - but taking from meals was down to 4.8 percent, displayed by the number.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy silability CGA, which included these figures, said: "As the sun continues with England longer than you are expected to participate in the World Crucial Clayi Cree follows the same example last year of June, when the pubs rise by 2.8 percent, unless the dining facilities are hard.
A 1.8 percent drop in a trading store in June increased dramatically in July.
Drinking bottles and overexposures are more like preferrs than low - table restaurants.
Food- headed pubs were also destroyed by the sun, though they are not as much as diners.
It seems that people want to get out of alcohol.
All the treating pubs and bars for drinking were more than 6.6 percent of the month, with a 3-inch diet.
Paul Newman, social analysts and guests, RSM, said: "These effects continue with the atmosphere we have seen since April.
The weather and influences of major social or sports matters remain the main priorities when it comes to exporting in the outside market.
Not surprisingly, shopping groups continue to fight, although a 1.8 percent increase in sales per year will be particularly painful for the costs of sustained costs.
The long-burning summer did not come at a very critical time for the drivers leading to food and time will mean that the temperature taken by August will give more breathing.
The general increase in pubs and stores, including a new reception, was 2.7 percent July, indicating the improvement of the brakes.
The Coffer Peach Tracker of the UK Pub, bar and resulator of the food department collects and works data from the 47 working groups, and combined prices over £ungu-9 million, and a set medical model.
One of five students with confidential radio accounts hiding from their parents
One of five children - others, such as three children - whose private records hide from their parents and teachers, demonstrates
The research of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the growth of the "Insta" false pages.
News has raised the tendency that sex substances are suspended in these channels.
20 percent of students say they have a "chief" account to show their parents
One of five children - others like 11 minors - create social news accounts that keep a secret to adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students has indicated rapid growth in the "Instake Insta" account - in reference to the Instaggram private site.
News reports have raised fears that the sex theme is sent.
Twenty percent of the students said they are running a "necessary" account for showing parents, when they are alone.
One mother who was upset at the stage of her 13-year-old daughter found a girl touching others to "take me out."
The research, with the Digital Aharreness UK and the Head of the independent Head (HMC) schools, found 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years of age, with two reports, and half of those who agreed to keep their accounts.
Prince of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: ‘ It disturbs many new people who are tempted to create Web sites where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Elidh Doyle will be "the voice of the players" on Scottish Atletics board
Elidh Doyle has been selected on the Scottish Atletics board as the presiding officer at the general annual convention.
Doyle a Scottish driver and Scottish assistant and Internet chairman Ian Beattie described travel as a good opportunity for those who take the lead in the games to benefit from his high international experience in the past ten years.
"Elidh has great respect throughout Scotland, the UK and the world sports community, and we are sure that Scottish athlets will benefit by removing him from the board," says Bettie.
Doyle said: "I like to act like the voice of the players, and I hope to help and help lead the game into Scotland."
The American, who has won 200 metres and 400 metres in the Atlanta games in 1996 between the Olympic gold of the Olympics and now BBC regularly, has been left unable to move after the use of ischemic attacks.
She wrote in Twitter: "Last month I have been noticed today.
I didn’t go.
The doctors said that the time would tell me what I would be coming back or what standards I would have set.
It was a tiring task but returned, learned how to walk again and today make a automatic drive!

The pump company has divided the image of commercials on the Internet and a declaration describing young mothers to be held by cattle.
To emphasize the introduction of the "first big bluemp," Elvie company has released the theme of sic-in-cheek inspired video video to show the new freedom pump gives mothers to advertise.
Four mothers have a dance in the bar of fresh cattle on the tracks that include sounds such as: "Yes, I don't think, but you don't see tail" and "If you haven't noticed these things, they're not.
Chorus continues: "Pamp is out, pump it out, feed the small, pump it, pump it out, pump it, and put it in my girls."
Even so, an advertisement, printed on a file film, has caused a conflict on the Internet.
In the opinion of 77,000 and hundreds of, the video has received mixed answers from viewers, many say it means "disease" in the milk industry.
"A suitable solution is used by cattle to announce this product.
As with us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are introduced to them before the days of birth, "write one.
Elvie's chest gun closely corresponds to the inside of a storage vessel (Elvie / mother)
Another said: ‘ Clearly worried about mother and child.
But yes, why not use it to publishpupupu to mothers who will keep their children?
Another person added: "Defensive to the sale."
Some defend the declaration, one woman acknowledging that she had received a "clean" song.
‘ I think this is mankind's idea.
And I will be alone, that I may yet fill them.
The moaning I felt made me feel like an ox.
The announcement was a bit painful, but I took it.
This is the product of the brain, "one wrote.
One said: ‘ This is a pleasant advertisement directed to mothers who are pumping (often in their workplace or private) and feel like ‘ cattle.'
This is not a declaration praising or judging the milk industry.
At the end of the video, a group of participants indicated that everyone was playing with distress pumps.
The theme of the campaign is based on the idea that many well - known women feel like cows.
Elvie Pmp, therefore completely silent, nowire or moths and it conforms firmly to the inside of the wrapper, giving women freedom to walk, hold their children, and go out.
Ana Baralin, an ECD equivalent to Mother, said: "Elvie’s steam is such a changeable product which was appropriate to the introduction of the liver and the touch.
By showing the similarities between women and milk cows we wanted to put breast beats together with all the physical challenges, when it shows how fun and what will look like the senseless freedoms that will bring.
This is not the first of the Elvie pump that makes the trigger.
During the Mondon week, the mother of two children appeared on the foundationelk of the deigner party Marta Jabowski while using this product.

The number of adopted children who have moved out of the way even though the monthly restrictions remain constant, thanks to the division that the heavy control and control policies of the Trump system make it difficult to lay up children and support.
Traditionally, many sponsors have become foreign, and they have threatened the survival of their country by further calling a child.
The risk increased by June, when government authorities announced that the supporters and other older members of their homes had to wear fingerprints, and if the date is to be shared with the authorities.
Last week, Mateu Albence, the senior officer and the Development of the Move and Transportation of the State, testified before the Conference that the agent supported the majority of the people who applied for the support of the children who were not involved.
The Ministry later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests had not been reported on crime.
"Almost 80 percent of the people are of particular support or family members who do not support the country illegally, and a large funk of these foreigners who are in conflict with the law.
So we continue to pursue such people, says Mr. Albence.
In order to advance children quickly, officers are promising new rules that will require that others appear in court within a month, not long after 60 days, which is the first requirement, in regard to the housing staff.
Many will appear on telephone conferences, rather than take a person into custody, to defend their legal position on the immigration judge.
Those considered unworthy of freedom will soon be removed.
After a long time for children to stay in a cell, they may say that they can be anxious or depressed, which can eventually lead to or out of the way, according to social workers and reports that have appeared in the system over the months to come.
Supporters say that this concern has been raised in a large institution such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficult symptoms can be forced, because of its size.
They added that taking the children to a tent town without providing enough time to prepare themselves physically or to say that friends could pick up much of the damage they suffered.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish that it is fast dependent
In view of the United Nations Assembly, President Walid al-Mualem also invited the Syrians to come home, although the war was now the eighth year.
Moualem, also serving as prime minister, says the outside naval forces of the Syrian world illegally, under the sense of fighting and violence, and "it will be taken accordingly."
"They must chase immediately and without order," said the company.
Moulem stressed that "a war of event is raging" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died in 2011, and millions more were displaced from their homes.
He says Damascus will continue its fight against this sacred war until we complete the whole region of Syria"
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, generally training and counseling troops of Kurdish and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 wars in the world in a war - torn country
In the refugee event, the Moulem said that these restrictions were good for her to return, and he said that "some Western countries" because of spreading the irrational fear that the refugees should live far away.
‘ We have called international and community organisations for this payment," he said.
‘ They have identified what should be a personal concern.'
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no restructuring in Syria until there is a political concordat between the Assad and opposition to the end of the war.
The UN combinations say that the newly signed agreement between Russia and Turkey is established at the level of the Tampon, the Idlib main tower has created an opportunity to further political claims.
The Russian - Turkish speech launched a major attack on the Russian civil war population, where three million people live.
The Moulem but stressed that the treaty "has been a long time" and expressed the hope that the war party will direct the missions to the Picadas, including the Al-Qaeda-neted and the Nusra Front, "to be destroyed."
UN delegate Staffan de Misura hopes that he will soon join the first conferences of a new committee organized by government members and opposition to form a Syrian military constitution and to provide a choice route.
The Moulem set up conditions for the Syrian State’s participation in the committee, saying that the functions of the cardinals should be prevented from "recognition of the articles of the current constitution," and warned against disturbance.

It is no wonder that 17 Pennsylvanias see a flood of expenditures, thanks to the transformation of joint cases in the affected areas of the same seat.
A region recently destroyed in the town of Pittsburgh recently reached the Democratic Rep.
The Lamb works against another authorized person, the Republic Keith Rothfus, currently representing the Pennsylvania district of 12, which carries much of 17th.
Maps were raised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had judged in January if the old provinces were not under the principle as preferred by the Republic.
The new competition in 17 has prevented the financial struggle between the major commissions, the Democratic Committee of the Community Committee (DCCC) and the National Council of the Republic of Cultural Affairs (NRC).
The Lamb became a common name in Pennsylvania after a young visitor by a special March 18 Central District District in Pennsylvania.
This seat was held by Ribuchuk for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 degrees.

U.S. Offset Penaling El Salvador With Chinese Support, after which it was supported
The diplomats say that the Romonic Republic and Panama have chosen Beijing, never to depart from Washington.
Mr Trump had a delightful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until a companion released the Trump Organization.
The Department of State has decided to return the American guests of El Salvador, the Romanian Republic, and the Panama about "the recent decision to be destroyed to be able to see Taiwan," says Heather Nauert, who spoke for the Department, at the commission this month.
But the sentences were considered only for El Salvador, which earned $140 million of American AIDS in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The planned penalties, which include the establishment of financial support and the countermeasures aimed at, would be sad for the North American country and for the lack of high jobs and rates of murder.
As the Internal Meetings progressed, the North American and North American officials slow down a high conference aimed at security and economic development following the same conference last year that was considered to be a major step in preventing migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid- September, the authorities of the supreme administration explained that they wanted the conference to continue, completely eliminating any consideration of El Salvador's judgments.
The Vice-Presidet Mike Perce is now prepared to deal with conferences, now arranged by October, in a sign of entry positions for this conference.

Reading history
The following index to drop may be the special counsel of Robert Mueller, Mr Trump’s report on the defense of righteousness, where there is much evidence in public information.
Mr Mueller is said to have responded to his research and that Mr. Trump’s mission is linked to Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congres will change their hands, Mr. Trump will find himself in the burden of that body, as he is ready to go back before the votes, perhaps finally becoming a judge of his peers.
This is a lot, and I do not like to show that Sir Trump is inevitable or unconventional in Europe.
There is a choice to make on both sides of the Atlantic to prevent the length of the long struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to direct Hitler, if the West alone opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakias in Munich.
We have won a victory, and we have lost the opportunity to avoid years of murder.
The course of history revolves about such points, and a democracy that cannot be supported is fast or slow.
Americans are facing points of light right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump's Joint-General Rod Rosenstein, man in charge of Mr Mueller's Future of Inquiry?
The Rosenstein was in the hot water since the paper was said, last year, he was secretly advised to write to the president and to express himself incorrectly in the office.
Mr Rosenstein says the Times account is not valid.
"What are we going to do when a recent investigation asks for FB.I. A Brett Kavanough does not keep or should it be confirmed in the Supreme Court despite the honest accusations of sexual assault and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote among the Accounts that will hold Mr. Trump?
If we pass that test, democracy will be in the long winter.
But I believe we will not lose, thanks to the lesson I read in Prague.

Public prosecutors need a rare NYC death sentence
New York prosecutors sought a death sentence on St. Saipov, a defendant in New York City for a courageous attack that killed eight people in strange punishments that had not been carried out during police crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, says that he used the Loto Dotto to hire a Home on a bicycle route along the West Side Highway in South Manhattan, to pay for foot and bicycle on his way in October.
To carry out the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to present evidence that Saipov purposely killed eight victims and "purpose" caused bodily injury, following notice for the death sentence, imposed in Northern New York State.
Both served the death sentence, according to the court’s judgment.
For weeks after the attack, the jury Grand jury struck Saipov with 22-count of accounting that included eight deaths in support of integrity, commonly used by medical destroyers in cases of crime, as well as in capitalizing and automation.
The attacks had to be "closed with a lot of plots," the prosecutors said, described the way the Saipov did as "a cruel, cruel and true".

Both Rosenbergs were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse for days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told investigators that he felt good about the things he had done, and the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to continue the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, in cases.
She was asked to show an IIS apartment in her hospital, said the police.
You are in debt to census-count.
David Patton, one of the authorities representing the Saviv, said that ‘ obviously he is discouraged' in the decision of the prosecutor.

Saipov's defense team ahead asked the hunters to seek a death sentence.

Another black person ?
YYny sues two after shooting after the word "racial"
The New York nony tells the couple quoted after they received the wrong text from the mother who complains that she is ‘ another black person.'
This couple disagrees that they are not partial, likening the suit to "robbing."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed concern when he learned that the new child service provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when he arrived on his first day of the project in 2016.
" NO LIGHT," wrote Nsz Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the quotation.
Even so, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrsz Maurice, twice.
After recognizing his gaffe, the Plasco-Flaxman was dismissed by Nsz Maurice, their emerging nany, who was an American, had done a worse job and rather than expect a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Msz Maurice was paid for the project one day and returned home in Uber.
Now, Maurice corrects the couple for compensation, and he seeks compensation for $350 a day for 6 months, the gig, if they have no contract.
"I want to show it, look, you don't do such things," he told the mail on Friday, adding "I know I'm against it."
The couple accused him of being an ethnic group, saying that it was reasonable to resign from Maurice’s job, fearing that they could trust him after being provoked.
"My wife sent her something that she didn't like to say.
He is not a nation.
We are not racial people, "Man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you put your children in the hands of someone who had made a quick, although it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come."
Comparing the suit to "thuging," Plasco said his wife was just two months old if she had a child and "he was heavy."
"You will follow such a man?
That is not the best thing to do, "the bank of the investment is added.
Although the case is still in progress, a civil court has been quick to look at a couple quoted from the entertainment world, focusing on their conduct and their thoughts.
The publishers in Paddington were afraid that students did not get along with the talker, a new publication showing
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said: ‘ It is difficult to put it on the shoes of the person who reads it for the first time before it is printed.
I am amazed now that we know about the great success in Paddington. "
He says that his father, who served as BBC Cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's manual on a small Bible, would be an ordinary man about his prohibited work, adding that the book was a pleasant "after his death last year.
In Paddington, which describes "the most important member of the family," added the father who had automatically relied on his success.
"He was an adult, and was not a proud person," he said.
"But because Paddington was true to her, it was difficult for her to have a child to accomplish something: she is proud of it though not really.
I suppose he had observed Paddington’s success that way.
Although he was his creation and opinion, he always gave him a debt to Paddington himself. "
My daughter was dying, and I had to speak on the phone
In the home of her daughter, she had been rushed to a hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"UNad always called it wrong, if he didn't expect to do it," said Nsz Edna-Laperouse.
"After that I received a call from Nad that he said he would die between two minutes and I had to tell him.
And I’m desperate.
I said, "Tashi, I love you dearly, I love you."
I will be with you soon.
I’ll be with you.
She had been given chemotherapy for her heart rate and had abandoned her system.
He had a short time in front of his hand, and this was all close.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that it all happened.
I could not cry or cry because I was put in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold together.
Finally Sir Edna-Laperouse, now sadly because of the loss of her daughter, took her plane and other passengers unaware of her problem.
"No one knew," he said.
“ I was touching my head, and tears were heard all the time.
It is hard to explain, but I felt this kind of kindness toward Nad.
If he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her.
Extracting CDs from the tower
Two women who lost a loved one in suicide tried to protect others from taking their life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to the Welsh Bridge and encouraging messages and telephone numbers to call for support.
Nsz Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began his life depression and suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I would feel every day," he said.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infection.
"Everyone knew because of his smile.
They always meant her smile.
Even so, she quit the job before she died, as she was in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was able to find his brother after he was alive.
Msz Davis said: ‘ I always worry that there will be a straight knock. ’
Ms Davis created the cards, "Let people know that there are people on the outside where you can talk, and even be friends.
Don't be quiet - you need to talk."
Msz Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Ns Davies, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after Mom died.
‘ Not that he was feeling down or depressed or anything,' he said.
"Just a few days before Christmas we noticed her change in attitude.
She was on the lowest road at Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, she didn't agree with anything.
He said that his death was a great victim to them, but they should work with him: "He prides the hole in the family.

The future of Brett Kavanough depends on record as the FBI initiates investigation.
‘ I thought that, if we could find something like the one that asked of us at a time, it is limited to time - perhaps we enter a little unity," says Mr Flake on Saturday, he added that he was running away from the committee "between the gridlock together.
Why do Sir Kavanug and his Republican sponsors want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of desire is due to time.
The election election will end in five weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do wrong, so their attempts to find the man they want to be elected to the highest court on earth will be weakened.
George W. Bush has been taking the telephone to call the Senators, asking him to support Mr Kavanug, who worked in the Western House on Mr Bush and met with him and his wife Ashley, who was secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI released its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where the Republic and Democratics are now seated.
It is not clear that Mr. Kavanough would reach 50 votes on the Senate level, which would allow Mike Pance, the president, to break the case and convince him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea User Number's Shutdown's ID under Kim
The number of North Koreans to South Korea has fallen from Kim Jong-un was strong seven years ago, said the South Korean President.
The Park Yeong-seug, which mentions the points from South relations service, said there was security for 1,127 last year - compared with 2,706 by 2011.
Mr Park said the control cuts off the border between North Korea and China and the high levels paid by chief dyeers.
Pyongyy did not create public opinion.
Most of the deaths from North are eventually donated by South Koreans.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Americans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled China, the longest border in North Korea, and it is easy to cross the Dilitised Zone (DMZ) Power between two Koreans.
China is referred to as unofficial migrants rather than runaways and is repeatedly returned.
The connection between North and South - which has been officially effective in the war over the next months.
Earlier this month, the two world leaders met at Pyongyang in a lecture that was aimed at riddles.
This occurred after the June historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work on the unspared Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Minister R Yong-ho says that the US sentences are for not slow progress.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will never use it for the first time," said Mr.R. in a speech at the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kaanough "Speech," that she is not prepared to serve in the Supreme Court.
The junior Prince of House Nancy Pelos called the High Court senior Brett Kavanough "trough" and said that he was unfit to serve in the High Court.
Philo provided answers to the Saturday conversation in Texas Tribune at Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think if a woman has done that way, they're going to take advantage of it," Peter said about his reply to Kavanough before the Council of Courts on Thursday.
Kavanough was officially permitted to smoke sex with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
At open, Kavanough was very moody, sometimes shouting out and together talking about his family and his high - school seniors.
He plainly judged democracys in the committee, calling for criticism on him of the "assuming together and man-organization" which was pursued by rare institutions if Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 national option.
Petro said that he believed Kavanough that he could not serve in the High Court, since it showed that he was being abused by Democrats.
‘ I think you are well prepared for such arguments and how they follow the Chintons and the Democratics," he said.
Peter was stressed when he was asked that he would try to disrupt the Kavanough if he was assured, and if the Democracles get the majority in the House of the Representatives.
"I'll mean this - if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, so he isn't qualified to be the Supreme Court, but to be in the present court," Peter said.
The Kavanuger currently judges in D.C.
Peter added that as a democracy he was concerned about the judgment of Kavanough Act or Roe v. long ago, as viewed as a last justice.
In his confirmation of the imprisonment, Kavanough had answered questions about whether he could change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a dangerous, private person to go to court and wait for us to say, 'that' is nothing,' says Peter.
And wives want to protect it.
The diatribe is good, the month and years of hot flashes, and cannot do it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrsz Steinem said to me afterward.
"I don't think about something strange, don't I?"
He went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a certain ruler in a certain place, who also wept when she cried, but developed a process which meant that when she was full of crying, she said to the man who spoke to her, "You think I am sorry because I cry."
I'm angry.
And she kept going.
And I thought it was wise.
Tears are allowed to be the gain of a grudge against another because of misunderstandings.
One of my more sharpest reminders than the first job, in a male-man-man-man-in-law office, where I found myself crying out in uncontrolled anger, was I held a scruff on my neck by an elderly wife - I’m always afraid of it - who is going to pull me on the platform.
"Never let them see them crying," he told me.
"He doesn't know that he is angry.
They think that you are sorry and that you will be happy because they come to you.
Patricia Schroeder, then the Democraticboman Society of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidentship.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a pasture outside a ship called the Shinkey and came out of the race, Mrsz Schroeder, he was very concerned, he might have thought that there was no reason for him to get the idea of running the president himself.
"We didn't think well," she said with laughter after 30 years.
"There were seven heard in this competition, and the last thing they needed was one.
One called the " Snow White and the Seven Popular's."
Because it was after the campaign, it was after financial support, and then she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she had raised $2 million.
It was a lost war.
He found that some of his clients who contributed 1,000 dollars to the men would give him only $250.
‘ Did they think I was getting a break?' She wondered.
When he made a speech announcing that he would not set up a formal campaign, he was affected by feelings — gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration and a policy that made it more difficult to raise money and direct votes than delegates, and anger to sexism - if he became mature.
"You think I will be disturbed," recalls Mrssz Schroeder about how the printer responded to him.
"You think Kleenex was my company's supporter.
I remember thinking, ‘ Will they put it on my rock? ’
"Are you sitting"?
How the US-Canada trade war can be a beautiful thing at Beijing
The salvos opening of the U.S. trade war between China and China was deaf, and while the conflict is far away, conflicts between countries can be useful to Beijing for a long time, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, dismissed the first warning at the beginning of the year by means of accrediting of outside Chinese talks including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The significant rise has been adjusted this week with new costs affecting $200 billion (US) cost of goods, properly with taxes for all USs coming from China.
Beijing is repeated again and again in a hurry, but the counter has just paid to ten per cent of America’s $60 million.
China has promised to identify US shot-shhot-shhot, and the majority of the world's economy will not be able to combine any time in the near future.
To get Washington to come down means to take the demands, but to bow to the United States will be very embarrassing to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards properly, the force of U.S. wars can surely help China more than long by reducing international dependence.
"The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the conditions which start to dump us economically in this country really more dangerous than the observers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, a senior friend toward Asia, says New American Security Culture, a thinking tank.
Syria 'has prepared' for the refugees to return, says the General of the Nations
Syria recommends a voluntary return to the refugees and encourages the reconstruction of a nation that was ravaged by war for over seven years.
When speaking at the United Nations Assembly, President Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the under-ground conditions are certainly thankful for the progress made in preventing violence," he said.
The State continues to rebuild property damaged by the cover so that it can restore habit.
All the conditions are present now for the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they have moved because of the violence and nonprofit economic values that have focused on their daily lives and their lives.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrian refugees since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people live in the country are in dire need of help.
"Al-Mulalem has said that the kingdom of Syria will receive help in rebuilding a land that is destroyed.
But he stressed that they would not accept legitimate help or assistance from member nations.
