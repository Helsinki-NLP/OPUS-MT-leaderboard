Welsh Council delegates are concerned about 'appearing like puppets'
There is concern among some delegates after the proposal that their position should be changed to MWP (the Welsh Parliamentary Delegate).
This is due to a plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh Parliament.
Council delegates from all political parties are concerned that the move will cause sarcasm.
A Leba envoy said that his group was concerned that the name "could match Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means fool and pwp means excrement.
Plaid's candidacy delegate said that the group as a whole is "not happy" and has proposed an alternative name.
A conservative delegate said his group were "right in ideas" about the change of name, but said they were the abbreviations of MWP to Kagosi.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced the same as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Senate panel, which is currently enacting legislation to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any keyword in respect to how the Council's delegates are referred to will certainly belong to the delegates themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh council the authority to change its name.
In June, Jopo published a result of consultations with the public on proposals that were broadly supported by referring to the council as the Welsh Parliament.
In terms of the position of Council Delegates, the Jopo preferred the Welsh Parliamentary Delegates or the WMP, but the MWP option received more support in consultations with the public.
Notably, the Council Delegates are proposing an alternative option, but efforts to reach an agreement may be a challenge for the Executive Officer, Elin Jones, tobye is expected to submit a draft of legislation on changes within weeks.
Laws on change will include other changes to how the council operates, including rules to remove the merits of the Council Commissioner and the structure of the committee system.
Council delegates will cast a final vote on the name they will be called when discussing the law.
The Macedonians will vote a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
This popular vote was planned to settle a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a region called Macedonia.
Authorities in Athens maintain that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim to their territory and has continued to oppose its request to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the opponent of a direct referendum on changing the name, has said he will ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that a change of name is needed so that they can join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin Go Silent as the Churches in Harlem Pass through Chagamoto
"Historically, the elders I have raised say that there was a church and a bar at every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, none."
He said the absence of bars is understandable.
"People flock in different ways" these days, he said.
"The bars are hesitant to be like a neighborhood lounge where people meet from time to time."
On the part of the churches, he is concerned that the money gained from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect them too, "and soon they will return to their original status."
Churches, he added, may be converted into large flats with privately owned houses that will not help maintain the remaining reserves in the surrounding area.
"The large number of people who are buying private homes in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so this situation will hasten these churches to be closed as a whole because there is no possibility that people in these flats will be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white partners before Harlem became a black city - the City Community in 1870 and named St. Martin a decade later.
The traditional white-medieval members left in the 1930s.
Members who were black who were participating in the surrounding area took up the erections.
St. Martin's came under black associates under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a strike of retailers at 125th Street, the main street for purchase in Harlem, who refused to hire or associate with blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when allies in the church of Priest Johnson laid out plans to rebuild it, they authorized the establishment of a set of bells played using a keyboard or automatic technique.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Priest Johnson and heir of St. Martin, called the set of bells "the bells of the poor."
An expert who played a set of bells in July called it another name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreversible historical landmark."
An expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also recognized that it was the first set of bells in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved into the area of the largest set at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin did not seek another replacement.
The bells that have been played in St. Martin over the past several months have been played by architects and contractors in a complex manner, some of whom were brought by church leaders, and others by the diocese of the Bishopric.
The administrative body in the parish, consisting of church administrators – wrote to the diocese in July concerned that the diocese "had a plan to transfer costs" to the council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors who were sent by the diocese.
Some members complained of absences and transparency from the diocese.
Pope injures 13-year-old while diving to trap rope-tree in California
Pope assaulted a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to trap a rope-tree in California on the first day of the rope-tree season, officials said.
The raid occurred shortly before 1 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV television in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming calling for help and then rowed with a group to help him stay in the water.
Hammel said that the first time he thought it was just a thrill of rope-tree trapping, but "I found out he was screaming, 'I'm bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His shoulder bone was out," Hammel said he discovered it after reaching the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
Boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed as in critical condition.
The species of the invasion shark is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a press briefing that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was classified as not a species of dangerous sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the top of his double.
Officers closed shore access from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for surveillance and security reasons.
Giles suggested that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury's wants to battle Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using beauty pageants with staff who are assistant professionals.
As a major part of planning to enter the beauty market worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the United Kingdom, which is growing as the sales of fashion and home furnishings decline, large beauty ranges will be tested in 11 stores across the country and introduced in more stores next year if this move is successful.
Investing in beauty has come to a close as supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelf space that were used to install television, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double the delivery of beauty products to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing editions from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more spaces with designated brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
This large store is also re-opening the grocery store for various cosmetic products so that most of the products are suitable for non-alcoholics – which is highly pressured by young consumers.
Moreover, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will conduct tests at two Sainsbury's stores, the first one opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and daily food shopping preferences on a small scale in a nearby retail store mean supermarkets have to make more effort to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive at Sainsbury's, has said that the store will have more visibility as a chain store with a chain of supermarkets trying to deal with Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been establishing small Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also established some Habitats stores starting when it bought the two chains two years ago, which states that it has increased the sales of vegetables and made the customer acquisition service more profitable.
The original attempt by the department store to revive its beauty units and medicine came to nothing.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger fell apart after a dispute arose over how to split revenue from the pharmacy in its supermarkets.
A new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds is said to contribute to the plan, by adding more luxury brands of facial and skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's business director, said: "We have changed the look and condition of our beauty product ranges to improve the quality of our customers.
We have also invested in professional staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our various brands are designed to meet all the needs and attractive environments and the right location means that we have now become an exciting place for beauty products that offers a great deal of competition for the original ways to make purchases."
Peter Jones 'disgusted' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million trade deal.
Dragons star Den, Peter Jones was left 'disgusted' after television presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from the <0xC2><0xA3>11million signage deal with his live fashion business to focus more on a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have enough time for their Truly brand of household goods and spares.
The two's business had been linked to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning wrote on Instagram to announce that he is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons star" Den Peter Jones traumatized by withdrawing from their lavish brand logo at the last minute - to take into consideration his new luxury contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "disgusted" when the popular girl on television admitted at a worried meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business plans - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she would not have enough time for handling their brand of home appliances and Truly's spares.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and had been said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, wrote on Instagram to announce he was leaving the Truly business, Jones left England by plane to one of his holiday homes.
A news source said: "Truly was among the things Holly focused on most.
It was to be his permanent future that would allow him to continue for more than decades to come.
His decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
Nobody believed what was going on on Tuesday, the launch time was very close.
There are warehouses full of merchandise at Marlow's Headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this presenter of This Morning, all of you who are the most reliable in the United Kingdom, could cost the business millions of dollars due to large investments in products including pillows, candles, clothes and home appliances and the possibility of launch delays.
And it can mark the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three children, and to be married to Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple goes on vacation with Jones who owns 40<0x25> of the Baldwin Runmaking plant.
Willoughby is expected to be an ambassador for the M<0x26>S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A news source close to Jones said last night that "We couldn't comment on his bilateral activities."
A stand-alone conversation 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticisms he would get from news agencies for making comments that others would consider "inappropriate for the president" and for praising the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so much more desperate?
Trump said in a sarcastic tone "the newscaster".
"I have not given up on anything."
He suggested that Kim prefers to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step in removing nuclear weapons from North Korea.
But negotiations to remove nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, North Korea's popular ambassador Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the U.N. The UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North Korean nation has not seen a "equal step" from the United States in the early stages of disarming North Korea.
Instead, he said, Marekena has promoted sanctions that aim to increase pressure.
Trump had a promising attitude in his speech to a rally.
"We are going well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have established a good partnership."
He said his efforts to improve cooperation with Kim have brought good results – halting rocket tests, assisting in the release of hostages and assisting in the repatriation of the corpses of American troops.
And he defended his unusual way of discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this packed stadium, we'd have 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing out to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake Indonesia Brings Huge Damage to Island, Killing Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Even though more than 10<0x25> of Lombok's population had been evacuated, no national disaster was declared, a condition needed to encourage international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've become very clear that they don't ask for international help, and that poses a challenge". Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children teamed up to travel to Palu, he is unsure whether foreign workers can work locally.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster organization, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see the same international organizations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Due to the frequent land tremors that occur in Indonesia, the country hio is left in poor alignment due to natural disasters.
Although residential huts due to the tsunami effect have been built in Aceh, they are rare in coastal areas.
The actual lack of tsunami warning bells in Palu, even though the warning was present, may have contributed to disaster.
In the best case, travelling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make transport operations complicated.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is heading towards Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the disaster area.
President Joko Widodo used the devastating infrastructure in Indonesia as the core of your electoral campaigns, and has invested heavily in the construction of roads and railways.
But the financial deficit has been a challenge for Mr. Joko's government as he approaches the election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from sectoral groups, where many Muslim allies have had conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of demonstrators were evacuated while groups of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets, by dispatching swords, bows and arrows and other powerful weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge hits a sharp equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League match against Chelsea by closing in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a bye from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri at around 30 yards from Chelsea's gate while his team was behind by a score of 1–0.
He moved the ball with his left foot before lifting the scraper to the top edge of the gate.
The ball extended over the defensive area and toward the top right corner of the net.
The ball then passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who had jumped and ended in a net.
"It was just trying to be in a hi-ho position, in order to reach the ball with players like Shaq always play the ball towards the front as much as they can, so I tried to make time for myself as much as I can," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I took one touch and I didn't even think much about it and I just hit the shit."
Chelsea led 1–0 during the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The team's striker The Blues hit with the heel iron and returned it to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before spinning from the centre of the field and running in the side of the Liverpool gate.
Kovacic gave away another player's iron and surrounded the opponent and received it in the middle of the field.
He then ironed a razor blade that allowed Hazard to head into the box.
Hazard quickly overtook the defenders and tied the scoreboard at the same angle on the other side of the gate with a left foot shot against Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool get to know Napoli in group matches of Champions League matches at 9pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea get acquainted with Videoton in the Europa League at 9pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster organization said earlier on Sunday.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings damaged by a magnitude 7.5 quake that occurred on Friday causing waves up to 20 feet high, organization spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, aged 32, for alleged murder after a woman was stabbed and died
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside on the morning of dawn today.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 1.55 a.m. with knife wounds on Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on murder charges.
Police have appealed to people in the area who saw or heard anything appear.
Detective Superintendent Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone close to John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear anything he doubted to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything with their car cameras to contact us because they may have explanations that are important to the investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was inside the building.
This day friends who believe they know a woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is ongoing and police have said that they are in the process of notifying the family members of his widow.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He had no say when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that it could take several hours before being allowed into the building.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up in the area crying.
He goes on to repeat the words 'very annoying'.
At 8pm police cars were inside the building and another vehicle was outside.
Several officers stood in the basement and followed the flats of the flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a personal message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers team without identifying themselves via 0800 555 111 and refer to the 247th anniversary of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest memorial to face the crisis of 'rewriting history'
His removal would be a justice worthy of his Taliban-like destruction with the art of many of the religious and cultural aspects of England enforced by his staunch Puritan allies.
But the Cromwellian Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "unfair" and "will respond to a rewriting of history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell's Community, said: "It would be inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's image outside Westminster Castle would be targeted.
The act of destroying symbols in the civil war in England was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the worst that Cromwell would be blamed about was the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the past century.
The impressive representation of Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft to Cromwell is evidence of 19th century views and part of the history of a man who many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament due to external pressure, a situation in which he was a source of royal leadership.
Whether this is the whole is an accurate representation on the topic of an ongoing historical debate.
What is evident is that the wars of the mid-17th century have laid the foundation for the future development of our country and Cromwell is a self-identified individual to represent a single radical in those rival groups.
His success as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and observance."
Pig Killer Hunting and Killing Chinese Farmer
A farmer was raided and killed by pigs on the market in southwest China, according to media reports in the area.
The man, identified by the last name of "Yuan," was found dead with a badly affected vein while bleeding near a pig shed in a market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give a pig vaccination in a pig chamber on May 20, 2005 in <0x58>ining province of <0x51>inghai, China.
He had reportedly traveled with a cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered the door of a neighboring pig shed was open.
He said that at the pig stand there was a male pig with blood in his mouth.
An investigation confirmed that the pig weighing <0xC2><0xA3>550 had knocked out and killed the farmer, according to reports.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and broken," the cousin, referred to by his first name as "Wu," said, how he was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Videos from security cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market at 10.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned by the Yuan nor his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been tied away to prevent him from stalking anyone else, while police gathered evidence in the area.
Yuan's family and market mammala are reported to be debating about his death.
Although rarely encountered, conditions for pigs to invade humans have been recorded previously.
In 2016, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing <0xC2><0xA3>650 pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his mistress shocked him and escaped.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs that pigs are usually not aggressive but tasting blood may be "a catalyst."
"They're just playing.
They are smelly, curious ... they have no intention of injuring you.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bringing heavy rains throughout the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa continues to weaken as it passes over calmer waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States for the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa was a 85 mph, Type 1 hurricane at 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and was sighted 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
By this time, the atmospheric pressure has begun to accumulate over the Pacific Ocean and head east toward the West Coast of the United States.[citation needed] As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to push tropical moist north into the southwest United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday
Then, the onset of tropical moisture interacting with the approaching atmospheric pressure will cause much rainfall in the southwest in the future.
In inland areas, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will cause sudden flash floods, mud slope and possible desert landslides.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall levels up to 2 to 3 inches per hour in one area, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in the southwest, especially most areas of Arizona.
Sudden flooding can occur due to the deteriorating conditions due to the prevailing tropical rain conditions.
It will be very dangerous to go out in the desert on foot due to the danger of falling with tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons that large rivers and thunderstorms will bring high winds and scattered dust.
The impending atmosphere will bring heavy rainfall to some coastal areas of Southern California.
Total amounts of rain over half an inch may occur, which can cause a slight downpour and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the area in the rainy season.
Some of the raindrops from the tropics will begin heading towards Arizona areas later on Sunday and Monday restore, before further rain later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread in the Four Horns on Tuesday to Wednesday.
October may have high temperatures changes throughout the United States as the Arctic temperature drops, but areas in the tropics will continue to have average temperatures.
Sometimes this causes a sudden change in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of sudden variation in temperature throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There is approximately a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the heat of the approaching summer will try to accumulate and spread again.
Most of the central and eastern regions of the United States are expected to be warm at the beginning of October and spread by 80 degrees from the Southern Plains to the Northwest Territories.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be 10 degrees more rugged than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States until half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh case
More than 20 million people watched major evidence on Thursday by Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman accusing him of sexual abuse allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, in six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular sessions to brighten the final leg of Friday's events: an agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation on charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is 100<0x25> confident that Kavanaugh held him undercover when he was drunk and tried to strip him in a preschool ceremony.
Kavanaugh, giving emotional testimony, said he is 100<0x25> confident that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people as reported by Nielsen on Friday watched.
The company was counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Data was not immediately obtained from other networks that aired, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And the Nielsen organization usually has the challenge of counting the people who are watching in the animation.
To put this in the right perspective, the hoo is an audience equal to the audience of a squash football game or the College of Studies Awards.
Fox News, whose program supervisors have been strongly supported by Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks to an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long hiatus trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Ham remained high after the trial.
Flake was the main subject in Friday's op-ed case.
After this average Republican official reported that he would be supporting Kavanaugh's nomination, he was intercepted by CNN and CBS cameras in the morning on Friday while he was booed by walnuts while trying to climb an elevator to attend a Court Committee hearing.
He stood down for several minutes while being rebuked, an event shown live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
She was told, "you're strong when most women don't."
Flake said that his office had reported and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have much to say in the committee's case.
The broadcast and cable networks were all flashing live hours later, while the Court Committee was voting to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a full vote.
But Flake said he could do it with the understanding that the FBI could investigate claims against the elect in the coming week, something a few Democrats have been arguing.
Flake was persuaded to some extent by a conversation with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was strong, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without an inquiry.
President Trump has opened an investigation through the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May has accused opponents of 'playing politics' in relation to Brexit.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plan to withdraw from the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and humiliating national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview near her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign affairs minister Boris Johnson insisted her attacks on her scheme known as Chequers for Brexit, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should collect individual tributes is "empty nonsense."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police have arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basket player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for second degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses from the scene of the attack and said they found Simpson's DNA on glasses, WAFB, a CBS associate, said.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail is set at <0xC2><0xA3>350,000, the Attorney-General reported.
An East Baton Rouge death investigator released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head in the neck.
The department compliments the Louisiana State Police detective, the police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest of a suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement authority for "progressively and enforcing justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot 6-tall player was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU basket football team.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basket football coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply affected" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"Things like this are what bother someone at all," Wade said.
Volcano spewing ashes over Mexico City
The ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighbouring areas of southern Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased inside the crater and recorded 183 times of emissions and ash for more than 24 hours.
This station was following a lot of thunder and vibrations.
Social media images showed thin ash covering car mirrors in neighboring Mexico City such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geologists have discovered an increase in activity on a volcano that is located 45 miles (720 km) south-east of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before independence vote celebration
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with protest police while thousands joined the protest rally to mark the first year of the Katalunya secession vote.
A group of demonstrators wearing puppets supporting the police-controlled isolation beat them with eggs and threw powder paint, resulting in dark dust clouds on the streets that would normally have many tourists.
Riots also occurred later that day as police used their staff to face the fighting.
For more than hours the pro-independence groups saying "No to forget, no forgiveness" faced the pro-communist protesters who were saying, "Uhispiania always."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protest, the regional media reported.
Concerns remain high in the area in favour of independence a year after a referendum on 1 October considered illegal by authorities in Madrid but celebrated by the pro-Conservatives.
Voters chose largely to gain independence, although the turnout rate was low with those opposed to secession ignoring the vote by a large margin.
According to the Kakatalunya authorities about 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region causing violent riots.
Independence supporters groups had camped all night on Friday to prevent protests to help national police.
The protest continued but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a protest of separation from his wife said he was no longer optimistic of Katalunya's prospects for independence.
"Last year we got to live in the best period of life.
I watched my parents cry happily for being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite gaining important victories despite very little in the last regional elections in December, the pro-Katalunya independence parties have failed to maintain momentum in this year with many of the most well-known leaders in exile in their own will or detention awaiting trial for organizing a referendum and a future statement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car mechanic recording a protest in support of the police on her phone, said that the conflict had been caused by politicians from both parties.
"The concern is growing further," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in a pretrial jail since late last year, announced that he would hold a seat in next year's European Parliament election.
"Standing as an election candidate for the European Parliament is the best way to refuse the backlash of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga's bat gives Livingston a 1–0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston's level promotion surprised Rangers with Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as the club's manager at Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's kickoff split the result between both teams with Gary Holt's team moving and holding second place equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in guest matches in the Premier League this season and will face the Hearts leaders, who are ahead of them by eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be the hosts of Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased the number of unbeaten matches to six in the ranking, where head coach Holt has not been defeated since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses out against unbeaten newcomers
Holt's team had to be ahead long before the shutout, with their direct attacking game causing Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson was able to get a chance but missed the target with his kick passed in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only kick the ball out after infiltrating to intercept a head ball from Craig Halkett.
The locals did not seem nervous and allowed the Rangers to own the game, knowing that they could trouble visitors with the catchphrase.
And it's that way where they managed to close the goal.
The Rangers were penalised for a tiebreaker and Livingston struggled to find a gap, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up and gave Menga a chance, who touched and tied the score from the centre of the box.
In the meantime, the Rangers had controlled possession of the ball but failed to penetrate the home team's defensive fortification and gatekeeper Liam Kelly would not be challenged for a long period of play,
The format continued in the second period, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save his scrapper.
Scott Pittman was held back to tie the score and the legs of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow landed the ball out after Livingston's next game of scrimmage.
Attacks continued to crack the Livingston team's kit and continued to be eliminated, while two claims of the penultimate – after Halkett dropped reserve player Glenn Middleton, and the other in relation to holding the ball by hand – were ignored.
'Awesome' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland Profile at Tony Macaroni
A wonderful job with good results for Livingston.
Literally, they had a better game and they continue to exceed expectations and continually rise to the top of the table.
Their style of play with the team has not changed much since their return to the major leagues, but many compliments go to Holt in a way that he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett contributed large, effectively owning a more well-ordered defensive fort, while Menga provided regular tackles to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the entire match.
The Rangers missed the Spurs, however.
Just as they've been good sometimes under Gerrard, they were under those standards.
They missed the final touch at the gate - only once were able to create a chance to score a spot in the home team's stronghold - and the rout is a challenge for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed-motion welcome in Cologne
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at revising relations between the two NATO allies.
They have varied on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The town is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons as a deterrent for a crowd of 25,000 not to be gathered in front of a mosque, but many supporters showed up in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - mostly Kurdish - also made their voices heard, denouncing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-party protest marks a division about the president's attitude who is seen as a hero to some German Turks and scorned by others as a dictator.

Long Lartin Prison : Six officers engaged in violence
Six prison officials have been injured in violence in a men's high-security jail, the Bureau of Prisons has said.
A riot occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 9:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Experts "Tornado" has been brought in to deal with the violence, which involves eight inmates and is embedded in one corner of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Jela Service said: "Workers with professional prison training have been brought in to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for minor injuries.
We do not support violence in our prisons and it is clear that those involved will be taken to the police and may be extra time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the jail governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year protest officials were called to prison to deal with a major disruption in which workers were attacked with tableballs.
Hurricane Rosa Risks Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Sudden Floods (Summer Regions Can Benefit)
It is not uncommon for tropical depressions to occur in Arizona, but that is exactly what can happen early next week when the remaining forces of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the West Desert and cause a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood warning Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and approach later Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has described on-line that "10 tropical cyclones have maintained storm and low pressure conditions within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
Recent examples of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, as well as a few levels of up to 6 inches on Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Western Desert including the Great Basin Rockies are likely to get 1 to 2 inches and have access to a few levels of up to 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of sudden flooding, hurricane Rosa's rainfall can be a blessing because the area is arid.
Although flooding is a source of great concern, some of these rains may be beneficial because South West areas are experiencing arid conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring. Just over 40<0x25> of Arizona is experiencing at least a severe drought, the second highest type," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to landfall through the territory of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning and a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and heads north for 12 miles per hour.
The storm is subject to calm waters in the Pacific and therefore its strength is diminished.
Thus, it is expected to reach the ground in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be high, causing a high flood risk.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to Sonora in the northwest and potential to reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression and then head up through Arizona and southern Utah Tuesday night.
"The main expected threat from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Northwest Sonora Desert and the United States. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are expected to cause sudden flooding of life-threatening and mud slope in deserts and landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest of four men who attempted to carry out the killing
Three young men of a 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stabbing wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured at Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, at the boundaries of 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he has been admitted to a "firm" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, an 18-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have asked anyone who may have caught up with the record an event with a mobile phone to appear.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'showed, boredom and anger' by the Democrats
"The vote of Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the brutal and horrifying tactics of the Democrat Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been "expressed with the boredom and anger" of the Democrat Party during his entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Parliament on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally rejecting claims from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually abused him decades ago when they were young.
Ford also testified in a case about the woman's claims.
The President said Saturday that "The American people saw the intelligence and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to prove Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to prove one of the most thorough intelligence of our times, a lawyer with a good record of service to the public," he told the West Virginia crowd.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters emerging to vote in representative elections.
"Five wikis from now on are one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but from another perspective I'm really running for it," he said.
"That's why I'm going around everywhere to beat debe good candidates."
Trump said that Democrats are willing to "oppose and prevent."
The first critical vote of order in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant has told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia and death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed, many moved as large waves reached the shore, while a large earthquake and tsunami shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a ceremony on the coast in the city of Palu on Friday when six-foot (18 m) waves hit dry land at night and moved many and destroyed them and destroyed everything in place.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still operating on the coast and they did not immediately flee and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster prevention agency BNPB said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone of it, it came with cars, logs, houses, affected everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before attacking the coast.
Other people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and saved themselves," he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 stations in the city Palau.
Air photos released by the disaster organization showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges were overturned and drowned by a water-topped mosque.
Smaller tremors continued to be heard in the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau of Statistics and Technology Applications (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's major earthquake was nearly 200 times stronger compared to the atomic bomb that had been detonated by Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, which is located at the end of a narrow corridor may have caused a tsunami surge, said.
Nugroho described the state of destruction as "a blessing" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were destroyed.
. The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others had been missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala , which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication was "completely disabled without any information" from Donggala , Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that volunteers and servicemen were heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it could be worse," it said.
The agency on Saturday was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had struck Palu , although leaders said the waves arrived shortly after the warning was issued.
In a non-professional video shared on social media, a man in the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting tsunami warnings approaching people on the streets.
Within a few minutes the tide reaches the coast and carries buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power loss which interrupted communications near Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes and supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated still need food and other basic needs.
The town's airport is only open with relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue stations in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia Tsunami Tsunami Death Rates More Than 800.
The Situation Is So Bad.
With the World Vision crew from Donggala having been successful safely in the town of Palu, where the workers are sheltering themselves in tents set out outside their aspirations, they went through the events of mass destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed" he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even though aid groups began relief operations, some complained that highly skilled foreign workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, finance, equipment and workers from abroad can only begin to enter if a disaster declares national.
That's not done yet.
"It's still a regional level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government has said, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can open to international assistance but there is still no such situation."
When the second night saw the city of Palu in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of those who were missing were hopeful that their loved ones would find each other and make it a miracle in their hopeless stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was found from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under rubble for two days and her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono , the coach of the Indonesia national umbrella jumping team, had taught two of the umbrella jump players who have been lost for the Asian Games, which was completed this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, together Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a leader in the field of umbrella jump, I have my emotional load," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, hours after information about the Roa Roa Hotel spread between the community of participants in an umbrella jump game, he had sent WhatsApp messages to rivals of Palu, who were participating in a beach concert.
His message, however, showed one grey mark, rather than two blue marks.
"I think that means that the message was not read," he said.
Thieves take <0x24>26,750 when filling ATM at Levee's Newport
The thieves on Friday morning stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink worker while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a story released from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was removing money from the ATM in the entertainment hall and preparing to put more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was dealing, another man "run out of the back of Brink's labourer" and stole a bag of money intended to be shipped.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene of the incident, according to reports, but police did not describe the specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport police via 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: A buzzer artist changes his name to Ye
The skater Kanye West changes his name to - Ye.
Announcing the changes to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A creature officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show who she regretted for "emotional reasons ," the show's producer said.
Despite being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously stated that the term has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'he' is a widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, referring to the name of his album with radio show host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It changed from Kanye, which means a special person, to just Ye - to be an example of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more an example of what we are."
He's one of the famous squatters who changed their names
Sean Combs was often known as kana Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his privileges under the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West member, JAY-Z, has also been forced to use his name with a lower case or without capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians as the country is about to mark the 50th anniversary of the massacre that had been bloody against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in the Tlatelolco Plaza that "so he would not use the military to deal with the Mexican people."
The troops shot at a peaceful protest in the building on October 2, 1968, killing at least 300 people while the leftist student movement was taking root in Latin American countries.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by offering a monthly scholarship to students and opening unpaid public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join organized crime.
The United States should double the A.I. funding.
As China continues to be more involved in smart minds, the United States should double the amount of money it spends in research in the field hio, said AI investor and expert, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various U.S. government units make announcements about AI, even though the U.S. generally lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: and it intends to be number 1 in the AI discovery by 2030.
"The doubling of the AI budget will be a good start, due to the situation that all the other countries are back more than the United States and we are looking for new innovations in the AI," Lee said.
To double the amount could double the chance that AI's next big success will take place in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: : China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most popular AI companies, Face <0x2B><0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he developed an AI system that surpassed Othello's top U.S. player and later became active in Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee agreed that the previous US government technology competition like the Robotics Association's in Defense Research Plans and asked to know when another competition will be, to help identify future experts.
Researchers in the United States often have to work extra time to get government aid, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes professional leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stars from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in AI.
"I think green cards should be given directly to PhD students in AI," he said.
The Chinese Land Committee released its Development Program in Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Dedication of Natural Sciences of China donates money to people in educational institutions similar to how the Dedication of Natural Sciences and other government agencies donate money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Center for Cooperation in Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage partners from the sector and academics and the White House announced the formation of an Investigation Committee in Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in a plan called AI Next.
For NSF, it currently funds over <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in action for months now.
Macedonians referendum on country name change
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on the change of its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that could resolve a multi-year dispute with Greece that limits its application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has maintained that the name of a neighbouring country in the north represents a claim to its province and has opposed the country's request to be a member of NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June according to the proposed new name, but national opponents say the change will undermine the ethnic recognition of the majority of the Calvinists in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign to ignore the vote has led to doubts as to whether the number of voters will reach the 50<0x25> threshold needed for the referendum to be accurate.
The question in the referendum reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership and agree to an agreement with Greece."
Followers of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a proper bailout to be paid in order to be accepted into organizations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries created as a result of Yugoslavia's disintegration.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because the move hoo means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally recognized, enough members of parliament have said they will support the results of the vote to make it more serious.
The name change will require the support of two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The country's electoral commission has said that there have been no reports of any violations by seven o'clock in the afternoon.
However, the voter turnout was only 16<0x25>, compared to 34<0x25> in the last parliamentary election in 2016 while 66<0x25> of registered voters voted.
""I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski , aged 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country a move that will open the way to joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of Skopje's parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, was providing a small platform and organizing seats in front of tents created by those who would oppose the referendum.
"We are joining NATO and the European Union, but we want to join willingly, not through the back door under pressure" said Kavadarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have our honor.
If they don't want to register us as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian partnership."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of 20<0x25>.
"I believe a large number will support because 80<0x25> of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that the "yes" result would be "evidence for our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said between 30<0x25> and 43<0x25> of voters will participate in the referendum - below the required level .
Another study, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV , found that 57<0x25> of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70<0x25> said they will vote yes.
For a referendum to limit the number of voters it should be 50<0x25> and one vote.
A defeat in the referendum will represent the first major blow to a Western leaning government policy since it took control in May of last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City surrounds Brighton's entire fort and closes the scoreboard
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling embarrassed Brighton's Rangers in a match in which Manchester City won 2–0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
Argentina's striker found a iron in the middle of the field and started the series.
He passed three of Brighton's banks, before penetrating into open territory.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players.
He shoved one of the bets and then outnumbered the others further to the corner of Brighton's gate box.
He then ironed in his left, and found Sterling.
The English striker used his touch first in the box and returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot around Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and a kick into the right side of the net.
"Aguero faces some problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored the score at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first control in the Super League match.
The bar closed in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a ball into the Brighton area in the attack.
He ironed a good wicket-keeper through the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched a few times before handing Sterling to the other side of the gate.
The Sky Blues striker touched the ball into the net before starting to celebrate.
City are against Hoffenheim in a group match of the Mabingw League at 12:55pm Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a destroyer against. Rockies
With the Nationals already eliminated from the playoffs, he had no other reasons to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to become a barrier on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a significant impact in the slugging for the Rockies, who are proud to have one game they haven't played against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies won the qualifying match by winning 5–2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still seeking a first-round crown.
"While we don't play to get anything, we can at least play a tough game in terms of what will be going on here in Denver and the crowd and the other hi-ho will be playing at the highest level at every level I'm going to face this year .
Why don't I want to compete at that level?"
National has yet to announce players who will start the game on Sunday, but say they have liked to let Scherzer get the ball out of the situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34th game, did a practice airing on Thursday and will be airing on his rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-handed player has 18–7 with an average of 2.53 runs and 300 points to be eliminated by hitting poorly in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds West Virginia meeting
The President indirectly referred to the situation facing his running mate Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he spoke of the need for Republicans to emerge in a plurality in the election of representatives.
"All the achievements we've achieved are at stake in November.
Five weeks from the most important choices in our lives.
This mi one of the big, big elections -- I'm not running but from another perspective I'm really running and that's why I'm all around to beat debe good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see what they're doing right now.
And they've decided to take power by any means possible, you can see boredom, perversion.
They don't care about the people who hurt them, who mistake him for power and control, what they want is power and control, we can't give them."
He said, the demokrats intend to "oppose and prevent."
"And you can see that in the last four days," he said, calling the Demokrats a people of "anger and greed and depravity and liars."
He mentioned a member of the Senator's Court Committee who is Dianne Feinstein by name, which led to an audience yelling at him.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you expose a document in a negative light?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, not, I waited for one - that was a very weak body language - the worst language I've ever witnessed."
The Leba Party is no longer a church to live in.
It does not tolerate free thought
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to remove me, it wasn't very strange.
After all, I am one in the line of Leba MPs to be told that we are not wanted - all by saying our thoughts.
Fellow in parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she stood for her rebellion against feminism.
In my case, the proposal to remove me was shocking to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a proper economic policy, on national security, on the European issue, the tie is that the issues are similar to those that Jeremy differs from previous leaders.
A statement to the Leba meeting in East Nottingham on Friday explained that "we want the meetings to be live and productive."
For over eight years as a regional Leba MP, GC's Friday night meetings have been fully encompassing that.
Unfortunately today, it did not resemble many meetings and the promise of "gentle, generous" politics had long been forgotten if, in fact, it had begun.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not accepted in the Leba party and all views are well regarded only if they are accepted by the party leadership.
this started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as a partner with whom I was thinking we share the same political outlook began to expect me to completely change ideas and take up positions that I would never have agreed with - whether it was about national security or the same market in the EU.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I'm saying - what follows is an insult on social media and an effort to keep me from being elected, to reject middle-class politics, and to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Leba party.
And it's not the situation I've gone through on my own.
Certainly, I know I'm more lucky than my other colleagues because the views focused on me are political.
I have a great respect for the skill and expression of my colleagues who are faced with sexual insults or color every day but never give up.
One of the depressing aspects of contemporary politics is how levels of abuse are considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Leba party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer a judiciary church and with every debate wla "lack of faith" or a change in the rules of appointment, the party becomes narrower in membership.
I've got a lot of advice over the last two years being urged to settle down, not to talk too much and that "I'll be okay."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Leba party 32 years ago as a school student, out of a drive for neglect by the Thatcher government that left my full school class almost to fall, I have worked to fight for better public service for those who need it most - whether it be a regional councillor or a government minister.
I haven't hidden the kind of my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused about attitude in policies and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who brought forward the debate on Friday, all I'm going to say is that as the country is about to leave the EU alma mater Brexit, a move that will hurt our family, business and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Leba party.
But in fact one message of mine is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to the citizens in my area, whether or not the members of the Leba party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that there is no amount of intimidation to be eliminated or political fitness will prevent me from considering what I believe is in the best interest to all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's unbeaten team still takes first place on the tables
Two attempts in the final may have changed to some extent the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this highly anticipated Tennent League match.
Now they lead the tables, the only team that hasn't been defeated.
Ultimately, it was their best defence , as well as the use of their positions, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie were entitled to satisfaction.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we have not yet been defeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took advantage of their best chances of being invited."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of multiple players and Jason Baggot got to score an undefeated try.
Climo added Ayr's lead to the penultimate, just before the break, scored and then completed a solo try and made the score 17–5 for Ayr during the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, blocked by Baggot, reduced the lead by five points.
The game was then stopped for a while after a fatal injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was removed while the game was renewed, Ayr extended his lead with a Stafford McDowall try, tied by Climo.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, Melrose took advantage of one more player and scored on a try by Bruce Colvine , the end of a period of intense pressure.
The home team took control again, however, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for fouling Climo without the ball and from the penultimate line out, MacPherson scored due to a strong attack from Ayr.
Climo scored, the way he was doing after the game restarted, after Kyle Rowe collected a pass from David Armstrong and poked Gregor Henry and scored the fifth try for the home team.
"'Still Game' star takes new job in restaurant sector".
The Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to enter the housing sector after it is discovered that he has been appointed as a director of a certified restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starring Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, in which he is the writer and co-star of his long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show and Kiernan seems to have another deal in life after Craiglang .
According to the official record catalog, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun news source claimed that Kiernan expected to be involved in a "very growing restaurant business" in Glasgow."
'The ocean is ours': Bolivia that has no port hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
The crew patrols at the sea headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings burn a blue flag like the sea.
Sea stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have written the phrase: "The ocean is our right.
Bringing it back is a duty."
All in port-less Bolivia, the memory of the coastal strip that lost it to Chile in the resource crisis of the 19th century is still clear - just as eager to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps the hopes are currently the highest for many years, with Bolivia awaiting the decision of an international justice court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has a pace, a spirit of unity and tranquility and indeed has the prospect of a positive attitude to the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla , Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivians will look at the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will issue a decision accepting Bolivia's demands - after several decades of appropriate dialogue - Chile will be forced to discuss the move to give Bolivia access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's natural president - who is facing heated confrontations in next year's re-election - also has much to do with Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore in late August.
But other critics believe that there is little chance that the court will give the decision that is right for Bolivia - and that there will be very little change even if it does.
The Dutch-based organisation does not have authority to nominate Chile for other countries, and has said that it cannot determine the outcome of the expected talks.
The ICJ decision will be issued only six months after the final debate points out that the case is "not complex," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate , a Chilean expert in international law.
And besides promoting Bolivia's hopes, the last four years may have brought it back.
"The issue of sea access is being exploited by Bolivia's current regime," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate .
Morales' political remarks have ended Chile's remaining goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the talks, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9> , Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were too fast.
Monday will give Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of differing for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in the Southern United States - was using the maritime issue as a political stream.
"Bolivia will never give up on her right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we need to go forward."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be possible unless it has confidence in the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never remove its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises it made during a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to re-establish nuclear diplomacy that had been unsuccessful for more than three months after a meeting with Singapore and North Korean president Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "small dream" that continuing U.S. sanctions and opposition to a report ending the Korean War will ever weaken the North.
Washington is afraid to accept information without Pyongyang first doing the necessary disarmament measures.
Kim and US President Donald Trump both want a second meeting.
But there is considerable doubt that Pyongyang is considering the removal of the weapons that the country considers as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to host the second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris shows the modern headlamps heading to the Royal Stores near you
If you want to add a collection of your hats or completely block the sun then you have found a solution.
Experts Valentino and Thom Browne launched a massive headset in their collection SS19 at a stage show which was a creative surprise at Fashion Week in Paris.
The hats that are hard to form have attracted many in the genre this summer and these designers have offered these beautiful hats to be used in the fashion platform.
The most striking Valentinian crest was of a tan cap set with broad fur-like edges that covered the heads of the models.
Other large items include tikitima models, a witch's hat and even pineapples - but they're not designed to give your head heat.
Thom Browne also revealed a mysterious rescue – with the time Halloween is approaching.
Many colored shells had lips sewn and resembling Hannibal Lecter than fashion skills
One design resembled a skuba diving device with a dashboard and glasses, while the other was similar to a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're going to go on a big fashion statement--you're lucky.
Fashion viewers are predicting that big hoodies can be on their way to the fancy shops around you.
The super hats offer a design in 'La Bomba', a straw hat with the edges of a width of two sticks and sends everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Lebo's followers developed this complex hat that was offered on social media made other top innovations used in the fashion platform - a professional bag of size that uses the swimwear model
The orange raffi bag, placed on the edge by a leather handle, was the highlight of the Jacquemus' La Riviera conventions of the SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity fashion expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see the big hats and baggy when it comes to the stores next summer - because the architect has brought a huge impact that will be difficult to ignore the needs of the big equipment.'
John Edward: Language knowledge is important to international citizens
The independent schools of Scotland continue to maintain a record of professional proficiency and this has continued in 2018 with another set of best test results, which is strengthened by personal and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
Despite the increase of more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland (almaafu SCIS), strive to provide the best level of care for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to provide their students with more and more education, the professions they choose and their position as international citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a specific school curriculum, we see modern languages becoming popular and a preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language that nature goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exam, we can see that languages govern the league table with high grade levels in independent schools.
A total of 68<0x25> of foreign language learners received an A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72<0x25> of the students obtained a High A score in Mandarin and 72<0x25> for German learners, 69<0x25> for French learners and 63<0x25> for Spanish learners also obtained an A.
This shows that autonomous schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and youth will need in their future.
Languages now, as an elective subject, are considered to the same degree as STEM courses (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school courses and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that one of the reasons employers said they found when they had the challenge of filling jobs, 17<0x25> was associated with lack of language skills .
Thus more and more, language skills become essential in order to provide young people with their future professions.
While many job opportunities are needed for language, this knowledge is important in the world of globalization.
Regardless of the profession one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will find a more realistic place in the future to have a life experience like this.
Having the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to YouGov's study of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75<0x25> were unable to speak a foreign language well in order to promote conversation in French which is the only language spoken by a bilingual, 15<0x25>.
This is why investing in language instruction is now important for current children.
Having multiple languages, especially those in developing countries, will give children a better chance of meaningful employment.
Within the Uscoti, each school will have a different language teaching.
Several schools will take into account more modern languages, where others will teach languages that seem more important to Britain in the future to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, as well as training professionals in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland offer to provide a learning environment that will provide children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of their future professions.
It cannot be challenged that at this time, in the case of international trade, that languages continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international knowledge of communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and quality to young Scots.
Il faut bien le dole.
John Edward is the Director of the Board of Independent Schools in the Scottish
LeBron played his first game with the Sunday Lakers at San Diego
Waiting time is about to end for fans eager to see LeBron James play the first match as a Los Angeles Lakers player.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the preseason game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than a minute and less than 48," said Walton to the Lakers' official website.
Lakers writer Mike Trudell explained in a tweet that James could play a few minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans on the Lakers' schedule of "six games ahead of the season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my game to be ready," he said.
Trump Political Conference in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five meetings scheduled to take place next week, including standing in areas where he has many supporters including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote to confirm whether it is still suspended about who appointed him to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create electoral support as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
How many hours will Trump's meeting in West Virginia be and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 1 p.m. Eastern Time Tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia conference online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week's trial about Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh, which has raised much concern over allegations of sexual abuse that led to a temporary suspension of a Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the goal of this round of rallies is to beat the Republican candidates in the November election to gain more popularity.
Accordingly, President Trump's campaign committee said these five meetings in the coming week are aimed at empowering volunteers and supporters as the Republican Party is trying to protect and expand the majority of seats in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of the Senate is crucial to its agenda so the president will travel through as many states as possible as we approach a season of further campaign activity," a Trump campaign committee spokesman who refused recognition told Reuters.
Scheduled to be held at the Wesbanco stadium in Wheeling, tonight's meeting could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh press broadcasting," according to West Virginia's Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with over 40<0x25> of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is back in the poll.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should arrive to try to improve his position in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows a struggling and keeping hope going to a one-man game on Sunday
After three periods in the same direction, the game of two players to two Saturday afternoons can be the excitement that the Ryder Cup requires
The motion of tampering is a perfectly designed concept of games but which players believe in truth and even more in contests such as
So they're going to say where the speed is going now?
"They had a lead of six points and now it's four, so we take it as a bit faster I think," said Jordan Spieth after the day's conclusion.
Europe have the best chance, of course, they are ahead with four points, remaining twelve points for the knockout round.
The Americans, as Spieth puts it, feel that they have extra power and have a lot to encourage, also considering Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day long and everyone is proud of three out of four points.
Spieth has been dangerous from the beginning of the game to the game's dungeon and leads by becoming a role model.
The pitching noise increased as his turn continued, incorporating the ball after hitting the ball toward the hole and balancing while he and Thomas were down by two points after two turns.
His ball shot to the pit won them a 15-hole match and you got a lot of shouting to celebrate, which shows you believing that the American team is still not heartbroken.
"You really have to concentrate on your own matches," Spieth said.
Now that's all these players have left to do now.
18 holes are waiting for them to show this.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the mystery story of the Ryder Cup.
The mysterious pair from Europe has four out of four marks and have not made any mistakes at present.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who didn't hit the ball more times on Saturday afternoons, but also avoided hitting the ball more times on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and in the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
The quality, and how their strength seems to increase between them and the crowd prove that the players are the ones who will give the highest level of competition on Sunday and probably no other top players can win for Europe when the day ends at the Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
Better if they all do it at the same time in different holes.
It is too early to discuss victory for Europe, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson faced each other accordingly with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in game two against the pair, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
An extra ball and two more balls in the opening nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedes in a situation that was hard to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one can crack you in a situation you will get into.
The two-player game against the two is very exciting to watch closely due to the interaction between the pair, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change on the spot.
Europe has done much better as a team so far and taken a great lead towards the final day but this pairing against the pair has also shown that the US team has a fighting rig that some, especially the US, doubted.
Europe lead by 10-6 in Ryder Cup final day
Europe would have a good chance on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning in a pair match and four balls to 10–6 against the United States.
The pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two wins against Tiger Woods who seemed overwhelmed and brought their total score to the present day at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to keep up with a shell that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, led the seemingly overwhelmed United States in a four-ball game in the morning, winning the series 3–1.
The United States gave further opposition in the pairs' matches against the pair and won two matches, but were unable to clear the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday games to remain with the tournament.
Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win four consecutive points when he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after a thrilling weekend became only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match they teamed up well and defeated Wood and American Bryson Decambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who was back in both matches on Saturday, showed periods of good play but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in four balls and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, rested for a four-ball match in the morning, returned to teaming with Henrik Stenson in a pair match losing 2 and 1 with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - they were listed in the first and third places in the world.
Europe found nothing though the day was beautiful, with an impressive wind in southwest Paris.
Three time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the pattern for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They scored 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Spain's Ian Poulter in a four-ball match and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in a pair game after losing two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team managed to get from behind by four points to one-man game, though Furyk's team only needs to get out of uniform to stay with the shell.
After being in second place for two days, however, the fight to win on Sunday seems to be going to be far from them.
North Korea says 'impossible' will disarm without confidence that others will do what they should.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was further undermining confidence in the United States and no way the country could disarm its nuclear weapons without others doing what they should under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "good measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking the nuclear test facility and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence from the United States there will be no confidence in our national security in such a situation and there is no way we will remove our weapons first without others doing what they should."
While Ri again insisted on North Korea's complaints about Washington's opposition to the "step" approach by removing nuclear weapons where North Korea would get a fair take on a small step, its report was seen as important as it did not reject the action to remove nuclear weapons on condition how Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint report by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current U.S. President and North Korean leader Singapore on June 12, while Kim promised to work to "remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal solution to the 1950–53 Korean war, but the United States says Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls to end international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first removal of nuclear weapons" and raises the level of pressure by using sanctions to achieve their goal through forcing and even opposing "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The attitude that sanctions may not weaken us is an impossible dream from the people who ignore us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are promoting mistrust.
"Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader alluded to at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead spotlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If an ally in this matter of removing the nuclear slurry would be South Korea and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula would not be in this dire situation."
However, Ri's speech was somewhat different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the United States mainland and North Korean rockets would not be inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump referred to Kim as a "man of rockets" aimed at carrying out assassinations.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking up arms disposal measures, but said a major work should still be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia say that the United Nations Security Council should sue Pyongyang for its actions.
However, the United States Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue in detail and without fail until we find the complete, final and verifiable disarmament of nuclear weapons."
Together, the Security Council has increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to withdraw funding for the nuclear and missile programs of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri after the United Nations General Assembly later stated that he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has toured North Korea three times already this year, but his final tour did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress has been made, but only within hours North Korea accused him of presenting "lawyer-like terms."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy both a missile base and a nuclear weapons base if the United States takes "related steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "related steps" he was wanting were the security assurance Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards strengthening relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught a lesson in getting enough breaks.
A new lesson at Harvard University this year requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to combat the culture of starved and read for 'night all's' with help from coffee.
‘An expert discovered students at university number one in the world are not knowledgeable about the basic issue of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the subject, which he believes to be the first type in the United States.
.He was given the opportunity to create a lesson after giving a lecture on how sleep deprivation affects instruction.
'At the end of the speech, a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just told these things now, in my last year?"
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, first introduced this year, explains to students the basics of how a good sleep style helps with academic and sporting activities as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and managing director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the subject after finding out that students had fallen asleep severely during the week.
The hour-long lesson involves a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is a picture of the bedroom, where students click for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and are told about the effects of coffee and light and how sports activities are affected by lack of sleep and the importance of sleep schedule.
In other places, participants are told how chronic insomnia can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, aggression and cancer.
A college map and interactive icon, then urges participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know the lesson will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the harm to health when you smoke,' Professor Czeisler added.
The pride culture in 'watching' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant lack of sleep was an ongoing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep, with good quality, you should be the student's 'secret weapon' to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the mind in a state of dissatisfaction and makes you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create a subject, having participated in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the lesson opened his eyes and gave him the chance to create a whole college class.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to take a corresponding lesson before joining a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should take into consideration the installation of both a sleep alarm and a time bell to wake up and be aware of the effects of the 'blue light' emitted by electric screens and LED lighting, which can damage the brain clock and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's bats Gerrard's youth ranks
The Rangers were again defeated in another game of the tournament when Dolly Menga's kick stole Steven Gerrard's team which looked overwhelmed and lost 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox team had intended to score their first foreign victory since a 4–1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team resulted in Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager and left his team as eight points behind Ladbrokes League leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and Rangers never looked like it would equalize.
As the Rangers now descend to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and is only behind Hibernian in the gap of the stables.
And there could be more problems for Rangers after flag bearer Calum Spence needed medical attention after a head injury to an object launched from Rangers supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team which tied Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who got a uniform against Hearts last week and would be pleased with how his well-prepared team faced their opponents all the time.
The Rangers took more possession of the ball but Livingston took advantage of their chances when they got the ball.
They were supposed to close just the second minute when the first ball from Menga gave Scott Pittman a pass to Allan McGregor's gate but the midfielder threw the ball out.
A club ball from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but fellow defenceman Alan Lithgow was only able to hit it out of the goal.
The Rangers took control but their game seemed only confident but not confident as they approached the shutout zone.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he would have to score a goal in the 15th minute after being hit by Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson said the game continued even after the Colombian claim.
Rangers were able to score two touchdowns in the goal during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly would not be much bothered by a head ball from Lassana Coulibaly and a weak interception from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's goal in the 34th minute was not due to a regular game, no one can deny that they deserved the victory.
The Rangers again failed to cope with a bowl ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't do anything when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was strong and hit the ball towards the touched Menga and scored.
Gerrard made the decision during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the hit point was about to get the result when the batter passed Morelos to him but Kelly ran from his spot and blocked the ball.
But Livingston continued to upset the visitors and made them play as they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett hitting a long ball after another.
Holt's team could add a goal in the final minutes but McGregor was steady and restrained Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball out to the head.
Rangers' reserve player Glenn Middleton had another claim for the penultimate minutes when they faced Jacobs but again referee Thomson ignored a request away.
Player of the Year: Geiger Counter's inventor
And now a page from our annual "Sunday Morning" syllabus: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and on TODAY...the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
The basis of science since then, the Geiger Counter began to be prominent in popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bell of Coronado," which included scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in this world?"
Rogers: "It's Counter Geiger's device, it's used to detect trace minerals, such as uranium.
When you place these head devices, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the transaction into the mineral."
Evans: "Say, it's starting to sound now!"
Hans "Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment

They can then 'see' a protein that is prominent in most cancers and then re-assigned.
A test vaccine shows positive results in patients with multiple cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify a malignant cell, was able to treat her ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
This method involves cooling the immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the lab so that they can "see" the normal protein for most cancers called HER2, and then re-installing the cells.
. Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Saratan Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a vaccine of great credibility."
HER2 "is responsible for the development of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and gut and purpure, Prof Berzofsky described.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching them" how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of leukemia.

Kanye Kanye West was cast in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a high-profile performance in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and stated that she could compete for office in 2020.
After a performance of his third song of the night, called Ghost Town where he was wearing a hat written Make America Great, he began scolding the Democrats and promised support to Trump.
"Whenever I talk to a white man he always says: "How can you love Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism I would leave the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a brief run that included Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the episode was not broadcast, West's content was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock attempted to tease West for the publication.
West had also complained to the audience that he had a difficult time before getting on stage about his hat.
"They treated me badly behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go there with that hat.'
They bullied me!
And then they said that I'm in a situation where I drowned," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see a place to sink?" saying that he'll wear my brave hero's hat, because this means you can't tell me what I'm fit to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments were disconcerted at least twice from an audience and SNL staff who seemed embarrassed, Variety Center reported, with one person there reporting to the publication: "The whole studio went completely silent."
West had been brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former lover, flautist Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love It, dressed as Perrier's Water Bottle.
West was supported by conservative group leader TPUSA, Candace Turner who published a tweet: "For one of the bravest people: ASANTE FOR SUMMARY AND UMMA."
But talk show host Karen Hunter published a tweet that West was just "expressing her attitude and that's a perfectly good thing."
"But I choose TO LOOK someone else (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "arts") who I believe agrees to spread a belief that is dangerous to my community.
He is free.
Even us too," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow skater, Snoop Dogg has changed to Snoop Lion and of course a late Prince musician, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.

Star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harington rebukes venomous penis
Kit Harington starred as Jon Snow in the HBO animated series Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, has rebuked those who have opium of so much masculinity, saying the roles on the screen mean little boys often feel like they should be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'there's something that's broken in place' and questions how to deal with the problem of toxic penance in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow star Rose Leslie, also aged 31, admitted he feels 'too much' to address this issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where are we wrong in the issue of penance?', he said.
'What have we been teaching men as they grow up, according to the question of the problem we now see?'
'Kit believes that television may be a role involved in an increase in toxic penis due to its male characters.
He continued: 'What is natural and what is taught?
That's what's being taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes little boys feel they should be this kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions at the moment we live in - how are we going to change that?
Because things are definitely going beyond our youth.
In an interview he also admitted that he will no longer be involved in the pre- and follow-up sessions of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next season, saying he is satisfied with the battlefield and horse.
From November Kit will be involved in a film from Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The character recently revealed that the point of meeting his wife Rose was the best due to her involvement in Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife at this point, that way I got my future family, and my life from there,' he said.
Rose starred as Ygritt , the love interest of the character Jon Snow who played as Kit, in the Emmy Award-winning animated series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie Scotland family.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14<0x25> increase in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and Aids.
Over 820,000 people are infected in the country, health leaders say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new episodes were caused by sex, and marked a change from the past.
HIV naturally spread rapidly in other regions of China due to blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had decreased to zero, Chinese health leaders said at a meeting in Yunnan province.
. However, year after year, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV outbreaks are a serious issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality in China was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be very high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90<0x25> of men in same-sex love eventually marry women.
Many disease-induced infections come from the use of immunity during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged access to all HIV drugs as part of efforts to address this issue.
Maxine Waters denied that her staffer exposed the data of GOP senators, rebuked 'dangerous lies' and 'dangerous conspiracy theories'
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that her staffer had published a personal profile of three Republican senators on the members' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat MP from Los Angeles said that the allegations were being spread by analysts and websites of "strong right-wing supporters".
"A lie, a lie, and a more meaningless lie," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The comments made allegedly include home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Comments appeared online Thursday, published by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on charges of sexual abuse against Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure came a short time after the senators accused Kavanaugh.
Conservative areas such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that recognizes the source of publications was associated with Waters' office and commented Waters employee, Hill reported.
"These unsubstantiated claims are completely false and completely misleading," Waters continued.
"My employee - whose identity, personal details, and safety have been affected due to these allegations of fraud and lies - was never involved in exposing these details.
Those unsubstantiated claims are completely false and completely misleading."
Waters' report was quickly leaked online, including former press secretary at the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he has no proper emotional control to become a Commissioner of Parliament.
When a person is being bullied for something he doesn't act, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't worry.
He should not question the intentions of the complainant.
He should be calm and unconcerned.
"Fleischer was seen as comparing Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats against Justice Kavanaugh, who was criticized by critics for appearing angry at a hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate through the Republican party who intends to remove Waters from representative elections, also published his ideas on Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he said to the tweet.
In a statement, Waters said his office had notified "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false claims.
"We will make sure that those who have acted on this matter are exposed, "continued," and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to everyone and all my staff."
Johnny English film review Strikes Again - a joke in the detective of Rowan Atkinson's wretched
It is common to look at the effects of Brexit in any new film that leans toward Britain but that doesn't apply to the shots of another comedy-warming comedy film by Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the humor of personal comedy in the theme of how crude we are will be a new opportunity abroad?
At any rate, Johnny English's eye-catching, moving face is licensed to make mistakes again in a reworked way for a second time — the name showing his signal further that he is designed with a broader sense of humor for non-English-speaking people.
He is actually a detective chizine who in spite of the curious demands for an interesting attraction demonstrates the qualities of Clouseau, the qualities of Mr Bean and the person responsible for one of the music scenes of the Charitables of Fire at the Olympic Key ceremony in London 2012.
He was initially involved as a traveller and international eccentric Atkinson was once involved in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving many if uninterested.
There is one or two elements in this recent JE film.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a jade suit of armor and rafts changing over time on his hat.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy became apparent here, but humor seems low and unnecessary, hussan because "big" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible include humor as part of it.
The humor seems to be aimed at children and not adults and to emulate me Johnny English's unique adventures are not mediocre and doesn't care how silent Atkinson films humor as the character Bean.
The annual assumption is now that Britain is in great trouble.
An on-line raider has managed to sneak into a secret British web site and expose the identity of all of the British spies out at work and surprise the spy at work - unfortunately it was a very easy task for Kevin Eldon.
In her final time as a grandmaster and facing a lot of opposition and she is already deeply affected in political popularity: Emma Thompson does very well for her character matching Teresa May but the story does not help her show these qualities.
His security advisers inform him that because the identity of each detective has been exposed, he must use a retired person.
And that means using Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school teacher at a prestigious school, but teaches informal training on how to be a secret spy: some good humor there, while English teaches a detective similar to the film School of Rock.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, he is associated with the commander of the fleet, an exciting opportunity where Vicki Pepperdine is not involved should.
Thus the characters who match Batman and Robin but for sabotage in the Secret Service of the Kingdom return to work and reconcile with Olga Kurylenko who plays Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister appears to be more involved in the spying of a bricklayer who claims to be able to solve all technology problems in the United Kingdom: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their most enjoyable journey : they pretend waitresses, set fire to a French villa restaurant; they start a riot and enter without permission in a luxury Volta boat; and English causes cashews when he tries to use the materials of a modified Reality to learn the insides of the Volta boat.
All breaks are definitely removed for that final sequence, but regardless of the tension and tension being generated, there are so many characteristics of children's programming in the film hiao.
Well-groomed.
And just as there are other Johnny English films I had to rethink: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The Leba denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days but be paid for five days.
The Leba Party led by Jeremy Corbyn will take into account the aggressive plan that the British will work for four days with a wig - but be paid five days.
The party is alleged to have required corporate leaders to pay money saved through artificial intelligence (AI) to employees by giving them an extra day.
It will let the workers grow with three days of rest - but they will still go home with the same income.
Sources said the idea would "be appropriate" the economic agenda of the party and plans to strengthen the country for workers.
Working four days a week has been supported by the Labour Union Centre as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A major source for the Leba Party told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not be done immediately but the four working days are equivalent to the party's attitude in balancing the economy for workers and also the party's overall strategy for the sector.'
'The Leba Party will not be the first to propose such an idea, the Green Party promised four working days a week during its 2017 general election campaign.
Ari hio is currently not supported by all in the Leba Party, however.
A spokesperson for the Leba Party said: 'Four working days per week are not party policy and it has not been taken into account by the party.'
The alternative Chancellor John McDonnell used the Lebe meeting last week to describe his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to remove power from 'invisible directors' and 'enriched' in service companies.
Chansela's alternative plan also means that current mathematicians in water companies will not be able to recover all of their money because the Leba Government can make a 'loss' on the grounds of recognized errors.
He also confirmed that plans to put employees on company boards and create Total Ownership Funds to provide 10<0x25> of private companies' money to employees, who would be eligible for an annual share of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy Explains the "60 Minutes" if an FBI investigation against Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote regarding his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question as to whether the FBI's results could change the minds of Republican senators to support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" columnist Scott Pelley asked Senators. Republican John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI can find anything that could cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his counterpart from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said towards the case, I said, I have spoken to Justice Kavanaugh.
"I called him after this happened, when the allegations showed up, I said, 'Did you do it?'"
He was firm, agile and accurate."
However, Graham's vote seems to be irreversible.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it will take very hard charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly declined, "Graham added, while he means Christine Blasey Ford."
"And everyone involved couldn't prove it.
It's 36 years now.
I don't see anything new to change."
What Is the Global Citizens' Festival and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, a music event which includes an impressive list of singing stars as well as equally interesting message; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen's Festival will lead tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only enjoying stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also increasing awareness for the real purpose of the event to end the poverty crisis by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which said in 2012 that it is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group looking to end poverty by increasing the number of people directly facing it.
In order to get a free event ticket (unless you would like to pay a VIP ticket), festival supporters had to complete a series of activities, or "acts" such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, calling or any other efforts to help increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how has the World Citizens' Festival been successful with 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of suspending people for free concert tickets a real way of persuading people to push for action, or just another case of what is known as "online activism only" - people feel like they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Citizens' Festival says it has recorded more than 19 million "acts" from its supporters to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have pushed world leaders to announce promises and policies worth <0x24>37 billion that will change the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, this group showed 390 pledges and announcements based on its actions, at least <0x24>10 billion already distributed or donated.
The group estimates the funds available so far have directly affected around 649 million people worldwide.
Some important pledges include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and donors in the United Kingdom who aim to "help children reach their full potential," promising to donate 35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from the World Citizens.
"With help from the British government, donors, national governments, and World Citizens like you, we can make the social violence of not having a better diet just history," the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live performance in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were completed in petitioning Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with better nutrition.
In response to a question in the <0x51>uestions and Answers section on his website that asked "what makes you think we can end the poverty crisis?"
The citizens of the World Citizens' Festival replied: It will be a long and hard way — sometimes we will fall and fall.
But, it was with human rights activists and anti-apartheid groups before us, we will succeed, because we have strength together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the stars who will sing at the event in New York City, which the locals will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy to "prevent" Russia's exports of energy - Minister of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from being sold, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has said, as described by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's participation in Syria - in particular, where it works at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason for them being the Middle East is to find energy markets the way they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and techniques to deal with that.
"The United Nations has that capability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are opened, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants who attended the event organized by the Users' Energy League, a non-profit group which states that it represents the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's methods of bilateral relations with Russia and Iran, noting that the countries are similar.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, accordingly, in relation to the use and replacement of oil," he said, referring to Russia as "having little knowledge" and an economy based on coal oil.
The reports come at a time when the Trump administration has been on a mission to increase its natural gas sales to Europe and replace Russia, which has become a very affordable option for European users.
Accordingly, Trump administration leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, have attempted to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "wrong" pipeline project of "Nord Stream 2," which according to Trump, made Berlin the "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion, which aims to double the current capacity of 110 billion megawatts, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin says that Washington's many opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy is not appropriate as a tool to make pressure and that users should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been used by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German organization leading in the sector, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has urged the United States to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem as the third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "He Will Look Deeply" To Run for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she could "look into detail" if she ran for president after the election of representatives.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and reform our spoiled government that includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will look into in detail if I run for president."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city hall, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned in me about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been actively talking about his opposition to Trump and his Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
"A poll released on Thursday, however, showed to a large number of voters in the Warren area they do not feel that he should run in 2020.
59<0x25> of "successful" voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run, according to the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Council.
Thirty-two percent supported a similar run.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38<0x25> supporting and 48<0x25> rejecting.
Other notable names of Democrats considering potential candidates include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide before January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites the trauma caused by a traumatic event for Track Palin at Donald Trump's
Track Palin, 26, stayed a year in Iraq after being registered in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through when he comes back, I can understand other families who are going through the effects of trauma caused by a traumatic event and some of the effects that our soldiers come back with," he told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin cited the arrest as "a controversial avoidance" and said that his son and other war veterans, "returned separately, come back with a tough ideology, come back wondering if there is respect that the Marines and astronauts and every other military partner, for his commitment to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence by a woman and affecting a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18, DC states support new immigration policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal opposition to a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing crime or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a small friend-of-law report on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers in opposition to policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions which was submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the country's policy has not been disclosed.
He said his boyfriend "and his sons co-defendants of the criminal group," persecuted him but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Lawyers for the countries supporting Grace described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which offer large numbers of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations facing the problems of organized crime and domestic violence.
A new asylum policy in the United States reversed the 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board which allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to be granted asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a Friday report that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, state and international laws."
"The country's law requires that all asylum claims be determined in accordance with the facts and specific circumstances of the claim, and the denial violates the principle," said a friend-of-the-court statement.
Further lawyers said in a statement that a policy prohibiting immigrants from entering negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "give essential services."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and criminal groups in June.
"The asylum is available to those fleeing their country due to bullying or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement on the policy.
The asylum action was not intended to solve all the problems - even all the major problems - that people face every day around the world.
Many rescue efforts in Palu as the number of disasters doubled in the race for survivors,
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It looks very bad," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever-stricken child at a rescue facility in the city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Fresh water is not readily available."
"The residents were seen returning to their damaged homes, taking wet equipment, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds were injured while hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, had lost control of the number of patients.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, buried him outside the Palu Army Hospital , where patients were being treated outside due to the subsequent tremors.
Tears filled his eyes reciting how a violent earthquake shook the room in the fifth floor of the hotel where they had his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I was squeezed into the rubble of the walls, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then she became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'extremism' through 'propaganda ads'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page advertisement in the U.S. magazine that sheds light on the mutual benefits of U.S. trade with China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American Journalists to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week referred to the addition of a paid Chinese Daily to the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in the State of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere with the U.S. delegation's election on November 6, allegations that China has opposed.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. election shows what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's speeding campaign to push for China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to set up advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently facing each other in a trade war that has resulted in an increase in the amount of tribute to each other's goods.
Chinese retaliation early in business was created to influence exporters from states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, China's leading exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing negatively affected U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now it reduces the bullying by posting propaganda ads to the free press."
"In dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using a method that has been sponsored by the United States of America of free speech and free news by posting advertisements covered on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, on the sections of the local newspapers in Beijing, you will find very few voices giving resistance and you will not be able to see the reality and the different views that the Chinese people may have about the troubled economic objectives of China, given that the press is closely controlled by the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers refused to publish" his article, though he did not say which magazine.
Republican Separation of Women Votes Toward a Period of Representative Votes Using the Kavanaugh Crisis, analysts Warn
With many supporters defending an elected member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual abuse, critics have warned that they will receive negative results, especially from women, during the election of representatives.
The feelings surrounding this have been very high and many Republicans openly expressed they wanted to continue the vote.
Those things cannot be put back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he is concerned that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI investigation would be sufficient to cool the voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and even all November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the Progressive Movement said on Friday, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched on the Senate highway as the Republican nominees for the Court Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The influence and motivation of the Democrats has exceeded expectations", "Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
"People say it has already reached a high standard; that's true.
But it can be much higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and small voters, aged 18 to 29, who when they don't like the president, don't usually vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony described sexual abuse against the Supreme Court's appointee, critics said adverse results could follow if Republicans would continue to affirm.
"This has been a muddy game for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the committee vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh is appointed, it's also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they treated him ," Guy Cecil, director of Priories USA, a group that helps select the Democrats, has said on the newsstand.
However, Americans seem to have some division about who is credible after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with many leaning towards Kavanaugh.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41<0x25> of participants are obvious or maybe they believed Ford's testimony, while 35<0x25> said it was obvious or maybe they believed Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38<0x25> said they thought Kavanaugh outright or maybe lied during his testimony, while only 30<0x25> have said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh persecuted him at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the Supreme Court Selector revealed his secret parts while they attended a ceremony while at school at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Explorer Plans to Create a New Web to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, is launching a new business that will offer a competitive edge against Facebook, Amazon and Google
The latest project of the technologist, Inrupt, is a company that is formed through the Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored by people who are allowed access permissions to the description.
In a special interview with Fast, Berners-Lee claimed that Inrupt's intentions are "world domination."
"We should do it now," he said regarding the business.
"It's a historical moment."
Programs use Solid technology to allow people to create a "personal data store online" or POD.
It can include a contact list, a list of things to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Store, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on the same browser and at the same time.
And what's unique about personal data storage online is that only a user can access what type of description.
The company refers to this as "personal access through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to Managing Director John Bruce, is for the company to bring in appropriate resources, process and knowledge to help make Solid available to everyone.

Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross Award winning priest during WW1
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter has been celebrated in his town 100 years later.
Colonel Lutena the Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a target raider four days later and never found out that he had won the highest British military award.
A memorial stone has been revealed by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that "it is a wonderful example" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years from his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Lutena Vann led his regiment along the Canal de Saint-<0x51>uentin "through heavy fog and heavy firing from the field and guns."
He later ran into the firing line and with "greater courage" led the line forward before using a field gun alone and aiming three weapons.
Colonel Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German target raider on 4 October 1918 - more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "acts that I know I can't reach but it's very impressive."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also installed a flower crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "he was feeling very respectful to take part in the parade" and added "the courage of the real hero is shown with support from a lot of people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but found Peppa Pig instead,
Consider this, you've waited all night to watch Bellator 206 except for rejection to watch the main event.
Bliss from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and was airing live all night in the United Kingdom via Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to get to know each other, viewers in the UK were left open mouths when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Others were disappointed after remaining awake until the early hours especially for fighting.
A fan on Twitter described changing and posting a children's cartoon as "some kind of horrible joke."
"It's a government regulation where it came at 6 a.m. the content wasn't appropriate so it had to change the programming to be for children," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Bellator markets and communications, when asked about the launch."
""Peppa the Pig," "Yes."".
Bellator president Scott Coker said that they will go to work on their schedule to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the frequency, I think we can probably consider this," Coker said.
"But now it's 6 a.m. Sunday there and we can't consider this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we pay attention to it.
I believe, when it changed there was a lot of message being sent and it didn't grow well.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government.
I can promise you that in the future something like that will not happen.
We're going to put it in five fights instead of six — as we normally do — and we tried to make an effort for the fans but failed.
It's an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'weak' because of his gender
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt miserable because of his gender throughout his development – but that gave him a boost to success in life.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't recognize that until he went to elementary school that "I realized that not everyone was like me."
Speaking on Radio 4 at Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she says that she talked about the gay rights issue to give others "hope."
He says that the step of parenthood made him less focused on winning at the Olympics.
Longtime producer Kirsty Young has been out for a period due to illness.
Sharing as an isolated character in Laverne's first episode, Daley states that he felt "some less" than everyone else his age because it was "unacceptable to love girls and boys."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of self-expression and certain deficits, and feeling different from others are things that have given me strength and ability to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he could not discourage anyone at last when they discovered his gender.
A two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games has been a prominent member in LGBT support campaigns and was used a ke ke class at Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries not to consider the issue of same-sex love as a crime.
He said he showed up because he felt lucky to be able to live without impact and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with another man - the American filmmaker - Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "you got him by surprise."
Daley was married to the Oscar winner, who is old to be invited for 20 years, last year but said that the age gap has never been a big issue.
"When you go through a lot at a very young age" - he went to the first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had gone through such things.
The couple became parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all attitude" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
"His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not agree that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had yet to get their Olympic tickets London 2012 - because he wanted to be the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you can't go near the hoo daddy range'," he said.
"I had held his hand when he stopped breathing and had to stop breathing completely and die was what I believed he had failed," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was the one I dreamed of for the rest of my life - diving in front of a crowd of our people at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also encouraged his choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - that had given him a boost during the preparations for the Olympics and led to him having a nervous breakdown.

Mickelson who has been playing poorly is placed on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday while playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his game so that he does not reach the milestone unhappily.
Mickelson, playing in two events a year and posting a 12th-place playoff record, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for four balls and a pair game.
Instead of being at the depth of the event, how he was often for the United States, this five time Super Cup winner split his day between being a fan and practicing the game in hopes of fixing his problem.
Never a leader even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the right choice for a game in the Le Golf National, whose bad ball is repeatedly penalized.
And if the field is not a sufficient reason, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces British champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with new player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind as they start a 12-man match, have a lot of opposition, Mickelson's match can prove crucial.
Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, embraced and embraced me and assured me that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great courage in his ability.
He is a celebrity and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two matches.
I expected him to play more, but that's how it happened and that's the way we thought we should consider.
He wants to be out there playing, just like anybody else."
Mickelson would pass Nick Faldo's record for most matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It may be his final in playing the Ryder Cup that has never matched the quality of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven uniforms, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
"He's funny, brave, he likes to tease people and he's a good person to have him in the team," he explained.
"I think that spring players were also happy to fight him also this week, which was interesting to see.
He has more contribution than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows lead scores may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a great lead coming into the final days of the Ryder Cup could turn into an uneasy journey.
Debian played his first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros led by five points against the Americans but finished as the game advanced, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding ourselves that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but very closely," said Bjorn, photographed, after watching the 2018 Classic win 5–3 Friday with a 10–6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history implies to me and everyone on the team that the game is not over yet.
You're going to be tougher there tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you have done things the way they should.
This game is not over until you score.
We have a goal and it's trying to win this tournament and there that's what we aim at.
I've said this all the time, I'm focusing on 12 players who are on our team, but we know better the quality of the opposing team - the best players in the world.
"Sadly pleased with how his players did in a difficult field, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't have hoped more of this in this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is a personal activity that will decide and that is something different.
It's good to be out there with a partner when things are interesting, but when you're out there alone, then you've been perfectly tested for all your potential as a golfer.
That's the message you need to tell the players, it's to act on your best tomorrow.
Now, you let your partner go and act better spontaneously, too.
"Unlike Bjorn, rival team captain Jim Furyk will send his players to do better on their own compared to when they played as allies, except Jordan Jordan and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was involved in the famous games on the final day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before finishing in defeat when Europe got "The Miracle of Medina."
"I remember every word," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, brought his players together towards the final day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get a good start as at Brookline, as you've seen in Medina.
When the pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the central matches.
We organized our players effectively and kept people in a way that we felt we preferred, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked to try to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in a high-profile match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the others on the European team in the top half of the list.
"I went with this group in this order because I think it illuminates the whole journey," said Bjorn to his choice of players in a personal game.
A new German warship is again fired
The newest ship of the German Navy was planned to be launched in 2014 to replace the older ships used in the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to poor systems and increased costs, the media reported.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit quoted a military spokesman.
This ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but future delivery issues affected the fate of this major project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships that the Navy commissioned in 2007 are coming in to replace the Bremen-class battleships.
It is known that it will include a power cannon, a range of aircraft and air-to-air and decorative missiles and ships as well as secret technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and akostic signals.
Other key components include organizations over time - it's possible to send the new ships two years away from home.
However, the ongoing delay means that the high-definition warships - said to allow Germany to target abroad - will already be obsolete when they come into service, explained Die Zeit.
The F125 became famous last year, when the German Navy refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had restored ships to shipbuilders after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for repatriation, but the German press referred to a number of reasons for "essential software faults and hulls" that made the ship useless if sent to war.
The shortage in the program was significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg would be operated by 120 sailors - only half of the crew on Bremen's old ships.
Also, it turned out that the ship has extra weight which amablo reduces her performance and limits the Navy's ability to improve it in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as the comparable ships used by the Germans in the Second Great War.
Besides faulty hulls, the cost of a whole project - including staff training - is also a major issue.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euros (<0x24>3.6 billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing the new ship become especially important due to the warning that German naval capabilities have dropped.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that Aerialism is indeed "going to lack ships capable of being sent to war."
The official said that the issue had been neglected for a long time, as the old ships were removed but no alternative ships were offered.
He complained that none of the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg type would be used by the Navy.
The Nationa Trust unveils the secret life of batsmen
New research in the area in the Uskoti Mountains aims to explain how bats use the environment in hunting their food.
You expect these results will provide new insights into the behavior of these unique flying animals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study of scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will follow the bats of pipistrelles and sopranos as well as the long-eared bats and the Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in key locations near the area to monitor bat operations throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out a telephone survey using hand-me-downs.
The acoustic analysis of all records will confirm the frequency of the bat sounds and the species doing so.
Environmental mapping and reports will be presented to create a comprehensive environment—a graphical framework for their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for nature in the NTS, expects results to show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species of bats.
This explanation will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as the formation of pastures and better forest management methods for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and England has declined significantly over the past century.
They pose a threat from building work and development that affects nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lamps can also cause hazards, as well as insecticides and some chemical products of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats are not particularly blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits their ears are more important than if their eyes arrive it is a point to catch prey.
They use a complex echolocation technique to target insects and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important 76,000 acres of land across the country, focuses on bats very carefully.
It has provided training to ten trained professionals, who regularly conduct research, nest inspection and sometimes rescue bats.
The organization has even established the first and only unique reserve of bats in Scotland on the property of the Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, where it is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson has said the property is an excellent location for the batsmen.
"Here in the Thrave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the beautiful surroundings.
But there's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and in other possessions will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
"He emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before making organizations within the property because it is possible for unconscious damage can kill up to 400 female bats and young bats, and possibly damage the entire population of bats in the area.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disrupt or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Association for the Conservation of Pops, has urged the public to intervene and help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats because many of our species we don't know how many remain."
Ronaldo denied allegations of rape while lawyers planned to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the rape allegations against him are "false news," saying that people "want to advertise themselves" under his name.
His lawyers have planned to appeal to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker and Juventus have been charged with raping an American woman , named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have later paid him <0x24>375,000 to be silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on Instagram's Live Video to 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, decried the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, the story of the lie, "the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says on camera."
"They want to advertise themselves under my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for naming my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they said are "unacceptable statements of suspicion in a private area," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in accordance with the seriousness of violations, which may be one of the largest personal rights violations in recent years."
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the back, according to documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt down after the incident and told him that by "99<0x25>" he is a "good" person who was dropped by "one percent."
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he had committed sexual activity, but it was voluntary.
Mayorga also says that he went to report to the police and was photographed for his injuries in the hospital, but later accepted outside court compensation because he felt "fear of revenge" and was concerned about "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now ready to pay compensation because she continues to be mentally disturbed by the incident.
Ronaldo was due to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the allegations, and this season he moved to Italian champions Juve when he was bought for <0xC2><0xA3>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will 'forever regret' losing its role as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Commerce Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was putting "anxiety" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a contract it could suspend production time at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr Clark
A Japanese automaker said the effect of border delays if there is no contract after Brexit will lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Auris Toyota and Avensis - produced around 150,000 vehicles last year where 90<0x25> of them were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU in March we will see a move to halt production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main issues relate to what manufacturers say are the risks of distribution in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
Toyota production is carried out on a "time-appropriate" basis, with equipment arriving every 37 minutes from dealers in the UK and the European Union for ordered vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be problems in the border that the sector says can cause delays in equipment shortages.
It is impossible for Toyota to wait more a day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and so production will be halted.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for Checkers for future relations with the European Union is "accurately planned to avoid the investigation at the border."
"We need to have a plan.We want to have a better deal that will allow not only success at the moment but also take advantage of the opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but the other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue to get the distribution that has been successful in the past."
Toyota was unable to say the time of production's suspension, but for a long time, it warned that additional costs would reduce factory competition and eventual job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite Union at the factory, said his associates are increasingly anxious: "In my experience once these jobs leave they never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "suspended for another week" with the conflict over the Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh continuing, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor David Mueller, who investigates electoral interference with Russia, the relationship between Trump's and Russia's deputies and possible obstruction of justice with the president.
Whether or not Trump seeks a job as deputy attorney general and thus endangering Mueller's freedom, it has fueled Washington's speculation for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, with it said he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced to take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "will prefer" not to fired Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with a case in the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, all testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, leading to delays in the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "The date for that has not been set, it could be this week, I can see that causing it to be pushed back for another week considering what it is in the high court.
But we will see what will happen to inform the media.
"Other reporters could object: Sanders has not hosted a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Local owner Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information is not due to the impartiality of television journalists "to attract attention," although he said: "I don't want to disagree with the fact that they attract attention."
He then said that direct communication between Trump and journalists will increase.
"The President makes sessions for <0x51>uestions and Answers more than any previous president," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We have looked at the figures."
"The press release will continue," Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask directly the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it many times and you've seen us do it more in the last few weeks and that this will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
"Trump responds regularly to questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings with the media alone are rare.
In New York this week the president probably pointed out why, by making speeches without order and sometimes appearing in front of assembled journalists.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff at Health Scotland about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working for the Scottish Health Association expressing gratitude for the country and expecting them to be left behind after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter while remaining six months until the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government is committed to meet the costs of applying for a state of residence for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In the course of the summer, talks between the United Kingdom and the European Union about withdrawal have continued, towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the British Government also improving its provisions for the impossibility of a solution.
I know this is a very unhappy time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to mention how I value the contribution of every worker, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and beyond, bring in valuable experience and knowledge that reinforces and improves the health care work, and helps the patients and the communities we serve.
Uscot is your home completely and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery After head injury
Tennessee State Tigers guard Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a game that they lost 31–27 on Saturday against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the edge and just fainted," Reed said.
The staff and medical doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen on the banks before placing him on the stretcher for further consideration.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no explanation as to the type/rate of pain yet" and the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-class student, ako in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which increased the total of tackles in the season to 18.
Outside buyers will be paid a high stamp duty if they buy in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be paid high stamp duty buying property in the UK with additional funds used to help homeless people under the new Tory scheme
The move aims to balance the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be paid to those who do not pay their tribute in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to earn up to <0x24>120 million annually - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be paid high stamp duty if they buy property in the UK - and extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to balance the success Jeremy Corbyn has achieved in order to attract younger voters with a promise to provide affordable housing and target high incomes.
Increases in stamp duty will be charged to individuals and businesses who do not pay their tribute in the UK, with additional money being used to improve the government's plan to combat residential conditions for people without homes.
The bonus - which includes the current stamp duty, including the high rates set two years ago on second-hand houses and rentals - could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the deal will give it up to <0x24>120 million annually.
An estimated 13<0x25> of new buildings in London are purchased by non-British residents, leading to an increase in prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to buy their first home.
Many wealthy parts of the country - especially in the capital - have become "a ghost town" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending more time abroad.
A new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson asked for discounts in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of setting property prices high by buying real estate and failing to build it and asking Ms. May to withdraw from renting to repair the "addiction in the housing sector" of the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an impressive series in residential reform, including tax control to deter the eviction "without error".
He also wants to give councillors more power to build new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year I wanted to volunteer to revive Britain's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means replacing our damaged residential sector.
England will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it cannot be fair to be easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes at the same price as hard-working residents in the UK.
For so many people the dream of home ownership has been far away and there are many possibilities of homelessness."
Jack Ross: 'The fate of my resolution is to be the boss of Uskoti'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "desire" is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.'
The Scotsman, aged 42, is very happy with the challenge of reviving the club's North-Eastern side, now in third place in the First League, three points from above.
He moved to Stadium of Light this season after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish League the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was able to get a country game for Team B and it got to that point," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound show.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child and I've always been impressed by that thing.
However, the opportunity will only come, if I succeed in the management of the club."
"Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he had no fear of adopting such popular names at such a large club, having rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My achievements at this time will be measured by 'How can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, of course it should be in the English Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to return, but I'd just like to see myself as successful here if I could get the club back up."
"Ross has only three years since he began his managerial career, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and within 15 months as a trainee at Hearts club.
He then helped Alloa from being relegated to third place and converted St Mirren from being relegated to winning the League cup the following season.
And Ross says he feels so much better than he was when playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably the real way," he recalled, of taking care of Alloa.
"I certainly believed management was right for me, more than playing.
It seems strange because I did right, I got the income from playing and enjoying the conditions of the highest level.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you should do every week.
I'm still going through it in the matter of stress and work pressure but I feel management is okay.
I always wanted to be an administrator and now I'm doing it, I feel the best inside of me in my entire adult life."

The best time for alcohol is 11.30 p.m. on Saturday, a study has found
The summer heat has increased drinking in struggling British bars but has added more pressure to restaurants.
Bats experienced a 2.7<0x25> increase in July - but drinking in restaurants dropped to 4.8<0x25>, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's business adviser, which included the figures, said: "The continued sunny and England's more part-time participation in the World Cup means July followed the same pattern as last June, while bars got a 2.8<0x25> increase, except that restaurants got even more impact.
A 1.8<0x25> reduction in the restaurant industry in June went down even further in July.
Drink bars did better while restaurants had discounts.
Food bars were affected in the summer, though not as restaurant operators.
It seems people just want to go out and get a drink.
Controlled bars experienced a 6.6<0x25> sales increase for the month and food shortages fell by three percent."
"Paul Newman, an entertainment and hospitality critic at RSM said: "This result is continuing in the direction we have seen since the end of April.
The climate and the impact of major social events or sports are still the biggest factors influencing sales in the domestic outdoor market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in annual sales of 4.8<0x25> will be devastating considering the ongoing pressures of cost.
Long-term summers have come at a much worse time for food service providers and we'll have to wait if the average temperature we got in August will change things for the better."
"The overall growth of sales in bars and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7<0x25> in July, compared to the decline in brand products.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they are hiding from their parents
One in five children - some even 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, research exposes
Research for 20,000 high school students has shown growth in the pages "Insta artificial"
The statement has caused fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of the students said that they own a "great" account to show parents
One in five children - some even 11-year-olds - create fake social media accounts that they keep secrets from adults.
Research for 20,000 high school students has shown rapid growth in the account "Insta fake" - a reference to the Instagram sharing website.
News has raised fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they create a "private" account to show parents, while they also own other private ones.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's website found a teenager urging others to "take her."
The Digital Awareness UK and the UK's Great Teachers Association of Independent Schools (HMC), found 40<0x25> of children aged 11 to 18 had two and a half accounts agreed to keep accounts private.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that many young people are being tested in creating online sites that parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scots Athletes as the non-executive director at the state board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is a Scottish athlete with the most awards and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the game to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the community of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's athletic community and we are confident athletics in the world will benefit greatly by engaging him on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am interested in being the voice of athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
An American, who won the 200 m and 400 m races at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among his four Olympic gold totals and is now an analyst at the BBC, failed to walk after suffering a lack of blood flow.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it will only be known in time if and to what extent I will be able to recover.
It's been a hard job to fully recover, learn again how to walk and today make a regression curve!
Thanks for the message of comfort!"
The announcement of a breast pump comparing mother to cow creates different views online
The breast pump company has divided opinion online using an ad that compares nursing mothers to nursing cattle.
To mark the launch of what is known as "the world's most silent breast pump outfit," users' technology company Elvie released a humorous music video advertisement to highlight the freedom that a new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
The four real mothers play denti in a barn filled with cowboy food with a song that includes such words as: "Well, I'm struggling, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed these twins they're not my breasts."
The song continues: "Shut it out, get it out, feed the kids, get it out, pull it out, suck my women."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 viewing times and hundreds of views, the video has received mixed reviews from viewers and many say it shows "fears" of the dairy sector.
"A terrible decision by using cow to advertise this product.
If we need to conceive and give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are removed immediately after birth," one wrote.
Elvie's breast pump goes very well into the breastfeeding syphilis (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It's psychologically disturbing to the mother and child.
But yes why don't you use it to promote a breast pump to the mothers who are left with their children?"
Another person added: "An advertisement that doesn't take into account the actual situation."
Others defended the announcement and one woman admitted that she felt the song was "hilarious."
I think this is a very sharp idea.
I'd get one if I was still breastfeeding.
Giving it up made me feel like a cow.
The ad is stupid but I understand it.
This is a product of high-quality design," one wrote.
Someone else said: "This is a fun ad that focuses on the depth of mother milking (often in a work place or toilet) and feels like "a cow."
"This is not an announcement to praise or censure the dairy sector."
At the end of the video a group of women show that they have all been playing with a pump on their sindaria.
The campaign concept comes from the knowledge that many women who use pumps say they feel like cattle.
Elvie's pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wire or tube and fits completely into the breastfeeding syringe and gives women freedom by moving, holding their babies and even going out while milking.
Ana Balarin, an ECD partner and teacher at Mother said: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and motivating launch.
Given the narrowness between describing women and dairy cows we wanted to put the act of pumping the breasts and all its challenges in monitoring, while expressing in a fun and pleasing way the sense of freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time an Elvie pump has hit the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, a mother of two walked on the stage with architect Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children secretly evacuated to Tent Camp in the Texas Border
The number of barred immigrant children has increased even though the number of passers-by has not changed, because the harsh politics and policies provided by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children on donors.
Typically, many donors have become unregistered immigrants and are afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country by promoting child demand.
The risk increased in June, when the state authorities announced that possible donors and other housing adults would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Mathew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested a number of people who had asked to fund isolated children.
The agency later confirmed that 70<0x25> of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"About 80<0x25> of the people who are donors or family members are here illegally and most of them are criminal aliens.
.So we keep track of those people," Mr. Albence said.
In the process of faster child slashing, the leaders introduced new laws that would require some to be submitted to the court within a month of the arrest, rather than 60 days, which was customary in the past, according to housing workers.
Many will be submitted via video conference call, rather than someone present, to request their case for a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for help will be quickly repatriated to their country.
The longer the child's detention is the more likely he or she is to experience fear and anxiety or discouragement, which can lead to feelings of trauma or attempts to escape, according to the custodial staff and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
Lawyers said these issues are mounting in large centres such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has a bad condition are ignored, due to their size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving enough time to provide them emotionally or interact with friends at last can add to the fate that many are already going through.
Syria tells 'called troops' of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, though it has now reached eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops are illegally stationed in Syria, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be handled accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and unconditionally," he told the meeting.
Moualem asserted that "the war on terrorism was almost complete" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more being displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy war until we save all areas of Syria" from all terrorist groups and "any foreign presence."
"The UN has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for them to return and blamed the "western states" for "spreading false fears" which have caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and human organizations to facilitate the return process," he said.
"They're putting politics on the human issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no construction assistance to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a sabbatical reservation in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented attacks by pro-Russian Syrian forces in the region, where three million people live.
Moualem however insisted that the agreement had a "clear time" and expressed hope that a military action would help militants including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-<0x51>aeda, who would be "completed."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to host the first meetings of a new committee that includes members of the government and the opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem stipulated the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the work of the panel should be controlled "to investigate the articles of the current constitution," and warned against intervention.
Reasons Why Trump Can't Win Election Again For Second Term
in that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless viewers love progress and many changes are hopeful that the removal of abuse of power and scandals will end his presidency early.
And to be of course "The greatest end of the presidency ever!"
At present, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, primetime ratings have doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" leads in cable television ratings for 3.5 million viewers on main news nights.
"These are things that draw people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's drama show "Designated Survivor," about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol's presidential primaries.
Nell Scovell, a former comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Very Hard Truth About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi trip in Boston prior to the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked.
"She said," Because she makes me laugh," Ms. Scovell told me.
There's the value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, a story from Washington may decide later on the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can reconnect with the health of the world economy.
Appearing is only a luxury for viewers with plenty of opportunities they can afford.
However, this issue far exceeds a conscious citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour of viewing a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deeply" in the sources of his book "Fear," a <0x24>15,000 suit of designer Paul Manafort's skin ("a heavy-handed and arrogant outfit," the Washington Post said) and a result of Stormy Daniels's comments on
I, never, will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"The part of what he's doing and making it look like a real show is that he's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and architect of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's show changing characters and scenes every day (starting confrontations in the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I approached Mr. Fleiss this week, there was an 80 degree sun outside his house on the north side of Kauai, but he had locked himself in watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not leave there, not if Brett Kavanaugh was about to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's fate if it is unknown.
"I remember when we were doing all these amazing sessions in the past and people were saying," This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out that they were right."

External funds overflow into the nearest election of Parliamentary representatives
Little wonder that Pennsylvania's 17 districts have experienced financial flooding, due to the resilience of the congressional districts that found two current leaders fighting for the same seat.
The district that gained Pittsburg's new boundaries has a Democrat Conor Lamb—who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running for another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, the current leader representing Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which is sweeping with 17 new.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been painted to suit the Republicans.
The incumbent on the new 17 has established financial competition in the philanthropic circles of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was a popular name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely pursued March special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been held by the Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Demokrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States Thought to Punish El Salvador for Supporting China, Then It Stopped
The diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and little pressure not to do so from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the allies blew up the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials in the State Department decided to remove the U.S.'s main diplomatic message from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama regarding "the recent decisions of Taiwan's lack of recognizance," the department's spokesman, Heather Nauert, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which earned <0x24>140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on visa applications, would have had a significant impact on the Central American country and unemployment and high murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American leaders proposed a high-level meeting on safety and economic well-being and followed a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to curb immigrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administration leaders made it clear that they wanted the rally to go ahead and effectively end any punitive considerations for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the meeting, scheduled to take place in mid-October, with a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the convention, diplomats said.
And three U.S. diplomats returned anonymously in El Salvado, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a strong new message or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton refused to provide information about the details of the debate made by three U.S. leaders, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks without revealing an identity.
Their views were confirmed by an outside critic close to the regime and he also spoke about without exposing the identity.
The History Study
The shoe that follows the fall could be Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, where there is now considerable evidence in the public eye.
Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes control, Mr. Trump will find himself facing cases of accountability in the legislature, just as he is preparing to go again to ask for votes for voters and perhaps eventually judges of his fellow members.
That's a lot of things that they're just saying is possible and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's removal from power is inevitable - nor to leaders like him in Europe.
There are choices that must be made by every side of the Atlantic that will affect how long the struggle is going on.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take up a coup against Hitler, only if the Western powers refused to support and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We were defeated and missed the opportunity to escape the years of the ensuing murder.
The focus of history revolves around such changes and the stability of the course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several changes at the moment.
How are we going to do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad mood since the newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to secretly record the president and said he is not worth being a fan.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' recall is incorrect.
"What will we be able to answer if a new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete and fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, we'll be able to vote in the election of House representatives who won't get Mr. Trump to focus on righteousness?
If we fail these measurements, democracy will face the risk of long term decline.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi government which at one point was using my diplomatic house.
He survived, moved to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika sign.
With that as my legacy, how can I miss a positive outlook on our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers hopes ahead of match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers are host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win against the Austrians, after a good uniform in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first match of the season to a 2–2 draw against Villarreal but believes Rangers could use the result to set up many points.
"It was a good mark for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We got into the game believing we could get something and we came back with one score.
Maybe we could get more at the end but, in general, the uniform was probably the same result.
They were probably the best in the first half and we went into the second half being the best.
Entering Thursday, it is another big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get all three points but it's going to be a tough game because they got good results in their last game but, with our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get good results.
Last year was very difficult, between everything that happened to my injuries and the change in the club but there's a good feeling about this place now.
The squad is the same as the players are very happy; your training is the same.
We hope, we can push now, forget the previous season and succeed."
Women lack sleep from fear of savings for retirement
Although it was true that the research participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a few people were talking to their families about this.
Approximately half of the people in a nationwide survey said they were talking to their loved ones about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10<0x25> said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want family members to care about them, but they don't take steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, the vice president of the Nationwide insurance business.
This is how one starts.
Talking to your boyfriend and children: you can't provide your family with a service if you don't make your requirements well known ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive services, because these options can be an important factor in determining costs.
Consult your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay the costs.
Your philanthropic options for long-term care may include a long-term insurance policy, a life-sustaining life-sustaining policy to address these costs or independent of your wealth - the best you have money.
Use your legal documents: block your legal cases in advance.
Get a medical service representation document so that you can appoint someone you believe to oversee your medical care and make sure experts comply with your requirements if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the lawyer's contribution to your finances.
You should choose someone you believe to make financial decisions for you and assure your expenses are paid on time.
Don't forget details: think your old parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
You have the ability to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Put the notes into a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only the money that's involved, but who are the doctors too?" asked Martin.
"What is therapy?
Who's going to handle dogs?
Make the plan appropriate."
A man is shot multiple times with an air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times by an air gun while walking home from a nightclub.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officials described the incident, which took place at 2:30 BST, as "a sudden act."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by the massive earthquake and tsunamis that hit Indonesia's Palu on Friday, leaders said and the number of disasters expected to rise.
With communications interrupted, aid officers have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administration, a region north of Palu that is close to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake disaster.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, it is located at the end of a narrow corridor on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was marking the 40th anniversary of the tsunami earthquake.
Donggala is a coastal jurisdiction over 300 km (180 miles) northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The provisional government, the administrative area under the county, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the economic base of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
nickel mining is also important in the province, but is particularly abundant in Morowali, Manitoba and the Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the course of 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is repeatedly hit by an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh Indonesia region of northern Sumatra on 26 December resulted in a tsunami hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of the dead came from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island , off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, an island of many residents in Indonesia and triggered a tsunami that broke the southern coast, killing around 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed several villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck the regime of Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing destruction and panic as people remembered the destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused at this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: A massive earthquake struck the Indonesian tourism island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded for a while.
Sarah Palin's Head Son Arrested on Domestic Abuse Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence concerns, obstructing a domestic violence report and refusing to be arrested, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a girlfriend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she picked up her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su's Pretrial Center and on an insecure <0x24>500 bail, reported KTUU.
He arrived at the Court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, certainly" when asked for his requests, the network reported.
Palin faces three serious Class A offenses, which means he can be imprisoned for up to one year and fined <0xC2><0xA3>250,000.
He has also been charged with Class B offences, penalties are imprisonment throughout the day and a fine of <0xC2><0xA3>2,000.
It is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of molesting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report on the attacks.
The case is now before the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, blocking a domestic crime report and possession of weapons while he was an alcoholic in connection with the incident.
Her boyfriend had said that she punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 after combining her child's violent behavior with Stress-Related Alarming PTSD based on her service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake Tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity networks and communications broke down and the death toll is expected to rise in the future.
An earthquake occurred just outside central Sulawesi which is located in the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing when the effects are present.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
State prosecutors seek rare death penalty for accused of terror attacks in New York City
State prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in New York City terrorist attacks that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been implemented in the state for a state crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is alleged to have used a Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking pedestrians and bicyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to a report of intent to seek the death penalty, issued in the Southern District of New York.
All of these offences carry the possibility of the death penalty, according to a court document.
Weeks after the attack, a panel of state judges ruled on 22 charges for Saipov which included eight counts of murder with the help of fraud, commonly used by state prosecutors in cases of organized crime and charges of traffic violence and destruction.
The attacks needed to be "prepared and well prepared," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "disgusting, cruel and misleading."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," a statement of intent said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York implemented capital punishment charges.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was implemented in a New York state case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were punished with death after being found guilty of plotting to blackmail the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by death by being placed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A native of Uzbekistan, Saipov expressed remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attacks after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has denied 22 criminal charges.
David Patton, one of the country's public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are "depressed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting guilty pleas for life in prison without the possibility of release will only increase it due to such incidents for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's representative team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilize the army of the people' today during a protest at the Tory meeting.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should 'feel heat' from anti-EU citizens - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she should be the head of talks with the European Union.
Conservative Party MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK 'should have been out' now if Mr Farage was to become Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Ms. May faces is the challenge of bringing together her very fragmented side something that became apparent when Tory supporters supporting Remaining joined a separate protest against Brexit in the town.
The prime minister is working to implement his agreement plan for Checkers amid criticism from Brexit supporters, who support Remaining and the European Union.
His allies insisted that he would go ahead and move to try to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of objections – and force anti-EU and the Leba party to choose between his plan and the 'controversial'.
Mr Bone told a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw the Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made an ally and given the responsibility of negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he had control, we'd already be out now,' he said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: 'I'll support Brexit but we need to forget the Checkers' plan.'
Expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We did not fight in a world war to remain subordinate to others.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain completely false.'
'Tory MP pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in protest and told reporters: 'I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Checkers plan is not so popular with the general public, the Opposition can't vote for it, he's not liked by our party and our activists who really go into the streets and help us get elected.
Please drop the Checkers program and start listening to people.'
In a message addressed to Ms. May, he added: 'The Prime Ministers preserve their positions when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the meeting that politicians should be made to 'feel the heat' if they are about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is about the issue of loyalty between us - people - and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we can't let him do it.'
In a message to the excited crowd he added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, feel warm.
'We encourage the army of the people of this country that will give us victory in Brexit and that will never rest until we are free, to be independent, to be a proud England.'
Meanwhile, Supporters continued to march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Many activists showed signs written in Tories against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Leba MP Mr. Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they experienced in the party program when the meeting was opened.
'They are not the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technologies of the UK and EU Programme respect the laws of another, with no problems, for free trade without borders in Ayyandi," he added.
'Cause it's just a lie.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'look into detail' the intention of running for president,
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is planning to "look into the intentions of running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about its fate during a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, who was chairman of the Trump Campaigns partnership in 2016 in Massachusetts.
He has been at the centre of speculation that he may face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the town hall format since Trump was elected.
The attendee asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it's time for women to go to Washington to reform our broken government, and that involves a woman in the upper seat."
A man is arrested in connection with the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the death in connection with the shooting of LSU basket player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Lieutenant Simpson, 20, at 5 a.m. ET in a press conference.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the person who appeared in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to protect the nephew when he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being at the scene of the incident, possession of weapons and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Park Police Department.
A 6-foot tall player raised in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and started in 10 games in the previous season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton comes close to winning the World Cup after team orders give him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear since Valtteri Bottas missed it before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team instructions would play a major role in the race.
From the start, Bottas got a good start and almost completely abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel took the lead first and left Hamilton to follow a trajectory on the tail of the team, something that was to play a major role.
Mercedes made one round and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton passed ahead after a tight race that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the inside free zone from the effect of a shutout after doing so twice in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was in seventh place by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for most of the race and held on then passed Kimi Raikkonen to fourth.
He eventually reached his refurbishment area in round 14 and failed to accelerate in the remaining eight rounds with Raikkonen taking fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a wonderful job with a whole wig and showed maturity to let me pass.
The team has done a unique job taking first and second place," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in a meeting Saturday about her insistence that she did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what is going on in the Senate indicated that people were "stupid, wrong and false."
"One thing that can happen and the good thing that's been going on a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bored and wrong and lying," he said.
"When you look at the offerings and the disclosures and then they say" oh, I didn't. I didn't.
I didn't."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you expose?
You remember his answer ... did you expose the script - "oh, oh, what?
Oh no!
I didn't expose.
"Well, wait a minute.
Did we expose ... No, we didn't expose it," he added, by imitating the senator.
Feinstein was used a letter describing the charges against Kavanaugh and Ford in July and was exposed in early September - but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
"I did not hide the accusations of Dr. Ford. I did not reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported
"He asked me to keep it in secret and I kept it in secret as he asked."
But his revelations did not seem to have been well received by the president, who commented during a Saturday night meeting: "I'll tell you this, that was a terrible body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's appointee, who has been charged with sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Demokrats were using the claim for their benefit.
"They have decided to take power in any way.
You see greed, evil, they don't care who hurts who, who they have affected in order to gain power and control," Mediaite reported the President saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5–3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two touchdowns for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars qualified for the losing match against Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League by winning a 5–3 round match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early lead through two innings from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised for the hosts before Dwyer gave the Giants the lead again.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two-goal Lukas Lundvald Nielsen gave them the victory.
It was the third match to lose in a season to Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and defeated Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time they had met in a season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 9:35 after getting the ball from Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford gave Beauvillier the ball to tie the second goal four minutes later.
In what was an exciting first period, Sullivan equalised at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave up the lead resulting in Cownie's 15:16 score.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal late in the first period.
The natives rebounded and Bouchard again equalised for them in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and secure the victory with a fifth goal in the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost the previous four games, will be the Millton Keynes native in their next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies while ensuring Hundreds of Travellers in Flight Can Avoid Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after losing his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people has departed safely.
Over 800 people have died and some are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Later tremors continue to occur in the area and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to escape from his position in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the road at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then flew the control tower of the trajectory when he thought it was falling.
He died later in hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Air Navigation company, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision was able to save hundreds of people, Australian ABC News reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, the leadership fears that the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster relief agency has said that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is minimal.
"The number is believed to be still increasing as many bodies were still trapped under the falls while challenging to reach the majority," organization spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Six feet of waves have destroyed Palu which will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft supply support and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Fresh water is not readily available.
Small markets are broken everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working to help the victims but we don't know how things are.
This is already a disaster, but the situation may be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all transfer-related operations.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok where over 550 people died.
Aircraft crash Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a plane crash into a lagoon.
The airline that owns a plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now said that one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued when the plane sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that by Saturday afternoon, it was unable to know when he was a man.
The agency said it is cooperating with regional leadership, hospitals and investigators in an attempt to find him.
The agency did not immediately respond to requests for more details regarding passengers, such as her age or nationality.
Regional boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Leaders said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The agency said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the series of events remains unknown.
The agency and all U.S. Marines said the plane landed in the lagoon just before it reached the track.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had crashed into the water on the road.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to walk through the water reaching them at the waist through emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He said flight attendants were scared and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
U.S. Marines said sailors who were working to improve the docks closely also helped rescue them with a breath boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 ft)
Data from Air Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crash-landing accidents registered with PNG over the past two decades but none have been involved with Air Niugini.
The critic shows a record of events on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution unit finished describing its case on Saturday in a repeat case in which a man accused of stabbing a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a professional witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He showed a panel of judges how he used cell phone records to combine the activities of 29-year-old defendant, <0x51>uinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of tragedy.
Rowlett said he received area data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis had Chambers on the evening of his death, contrary to his earlier claims, Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed his cell phone had Chambers' when he said he had a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said they were in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my car was Nashville."
"Another inconsistencies is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for only two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages and contact details from his phone.
"He completely erased him from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be handed over to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip hop?
Trinitarian hip hop singers want to criticise the negative stereotype by filling in their music and positive message.
High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop was lost away from its political message roots and coping with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make a revolutionary hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen new popularity in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
Home minister New York accuses couple of being fired after a "racially biased" message
A house minister from New York accuses the couple of firing her on grounds of discrimination after receiving an unauthorised message from a mother complaining that she was "just another black person."
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the allegations to a "deception."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed concern after discovering that the baby's new provider, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after arriving on her first working day in 2016.
"WHAT DOESN'T LOOK AT ONE TIME," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
Upon discovering his mistake, the "anxiety" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their departing minister, of African-American descent, had done a bad job and that he was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then returned to Uber's home.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation in connection with the dismissal and wants a <0x24>350 per day for the sixth month, for work to live and work, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't deserve to do the same," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's prejudice."
The couple have denied claims that they are racist, saying that stopping Maurice's job grew the right move, fearing they could no longer trust him after making a mistake on him.
"'My wife had sent her a message she didn't intend'".
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But can you put your children in the hands of someone you have wronged, even if it is by mistake?
Your baby?
Tell the truth."
Comparing the charges to "a fraud," Plasco said it was only two months after his wife had a child and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to sue someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the banker said.
Although a legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has denounced the couple on social media, and attacked their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid readers would not prefer in relation to the talking bear, a new letter indicates
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after this book was accepted, said regarding the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the shoes of a first-time reader before publication.
It's very exciting to know about Paddington's great achievements."
Saying his father, who worked as a camera attendant at the BBC before getting the urge to write a children's book from a small bear toy, would not have a bad feeling for his work to be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who describes him as "a very important member of our family," he added that his father greatly enjoyed his success.
"He was a man with very little words and was not arrogant," he said.
"But because Paddington was so important to him, it's like having a successful child: you're proud even though it's not your actions.
I think he saw Paddington's success in such a way.
Although it was his architecture and his ideas, he was always praising Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to move over the phone.
After discovering that his daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Ned used to call repeatedly and said that the situation was very bad and he was not expected to live," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from the Nad to tell me he'd die within the next two minutes and I had to move goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi , I love you very much, my child.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given him for his spirit to continue beating were slowly depleting his system.
He had died a while before and this was just his system to stop working.
I just had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not cry or scream because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to give myself a heart.
"In the end Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – without them knowing what she was going through.
"No one knew, he said.
"I had bowed my head and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's when I was on the plane when I felt so sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him."
Mourning women place cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones by suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on the Welsh bridge with strong messages and phone numbers that people can call.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from stress and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her child was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew him with his smile.
Everyone said his smile pleased everyone."
However, he quit before he died, because he was "a place of darkness."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the first to find his brother after his suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm always worried that this will affect others."
Mrs. Davis created a card, "to enable people to know that there are people out there who can go and talk to them, even if they're friends.
Don't be quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old boyfriend, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say that he feels bad or suffers from thoughts," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we discovered a change in his attitude.
She was absolutely down on Christmas Day—when the kids were opening their presents she didn't want to look at them with her eyes or communicate."
He said his death led to the fate of them, but they must strive to keep living: "It puts a hole in the family.
It depresses us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's fate staggers as FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could find something like what he asked for - a study with a climax of time, a climax of magnitude - maybe we could bring about a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling" due to the futurism controversy.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to time.
The election of representatives takes place only five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans lose so much, then they will be very weak in their efforts to keep the person they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senators, persuading them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be voting in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats working.
It is still unclear if Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the uniform and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un gained power seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's coalition ministry, said that there were 1,127 refugees last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said higher controls on the border between North Korea and China and higher levels of fines imposed on trafficking were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not made a public comment.
Most of the refugees from the North are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many flee through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily-flagged Military Zone (almaafu DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still in actual war - have changed dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the ceasefire nuclear talks.
The incident came after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on broader terms to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under that condition, there is no way we will remove nuclear weapons as the first," said Mr Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as "uncontrollable," and says she is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority Leader in Parliament Nancy Pelosi has said Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh is an "uncontrollable" person and said he has so much emotion that he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if it was a woman he had ever done that way, they would say 'he can't control himself,'" Pelosi said of his response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied allegations that he abused Dak Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
At the time of his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and running out of breath talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also openly denounced the Democrats on the committee, citing the accusations against him as being "disgraceful and scheduled to destroy his reputation" organized by angry Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he is incapable of serving in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he is prejudiced against the Demokrats.
"I think he is withdrawing for those terms and how he denounced the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi did not object when asked if he would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if confirmed and should the Democrats become a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's inappropriate not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Fair Service Act or Roe's case against Wade, because he is said to be a conservative judge.
In his prosecution of evidence, Kavanaugh avoided questioning as to whether he could alter certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for an angry, prejudiced man to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's not weird,'" said Pelosi.
And Women Should Use It.
It's a good review of the bitters, the months and years of the most rage and can't take it away without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's normal, do you?"
He continued,"I was greatly helped by a woman who was active somewhere, who also said she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she could tell the person she was talking to,"You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
Then he continued to explain to me.
And I thought that was a good idea."
"The tears are allowed as a means of eliminating rage because they are fundamentally unexplained.
One of my memories that I remember most from my early work, was an office full of men, where once I found myself crying in an irrational rage, I was caught in the back of the neck by a great presiding woman who I was always a little afraid of - who pulled me up to the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy because they're with you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found with an extramarital affair aboard a boat known as Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Ms. Schroeder, became distraught and saw no reason not to be able to run for the presidency.
"It wasn't a decision that made well," he told me while laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to this as the popular "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the duration of the campaign grew up has gone a lot, he was behind in raising the fidh and so he vowed that he would not enter the race unless he raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a war he was losing.
He found that some of his followers who donated <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 to men would only give him <0xC2><0xA3>250.
"Do they think that pigeons get a discount?" he wondered.
When he made his speech announcing that he could not launch an official campaign, he was filled with feelings – thanks to the people who helped him, confused with a system that made it very difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates and anger from gender discrimination – until he ran out of breath.
"You'd think that I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the media took the case.
"You'd think the Kleenex company were my business sponsors.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my grave?
"She wept?".
How trade war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing
The initial sounds in the trade war between the United States and China were very disturbing and although the war will not end soon, the distinction between countries may be of benefit to Beijing for a long time, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by paying tribute to important Chinese sales including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most influential diversity began this week with a new tribute affecting products worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), paying tribute to half of all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated every now and then, recently imposed a five to ten percent tribute to US<0x24>60 billion in goods.
China has promised to feed America's measures, and the country's second largest economy does not seem to give up anytime soon.
To make Washington change the move means you should accept the terms, but publicly accepting American pressure would be a big shame for <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game well, the plight of the trade war against the United States can help China in the long run by reducing the support between the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can begin to change in the economy in any of its countries and more dangerous than others had previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who is focusing on Asia at the new U.S. Security Consultative Center.
Syria 'ready' to return to refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria has said that it is ready for a voluntary return to refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a country devastated by a long-term war of more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Affairs minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is stabilized.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure due to the progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore regularity.
All conditions now exist for voluntary return of refugees to the country where they were forced to flee due to terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily lives and careers.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government will welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he insisted that they do not want assistance on terms or assistance from countries that funded the terrorism.
Europe wins Ryder Cup Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at the Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again as Denmark's team captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a difficult time throughout the tournament, hit his first ball in the water in the 16th hole of 3 holes, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player Molinari played well in all of his turns and became the 1st player to reach 5–0–0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 by 4 and the player listed below in the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
A player in eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in the tournament with 25.5 points in his games.
"It's not usual for me to cry but today I'm soaked.
It's been a challenging year.
Thanks to Thomas for appointing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, I'm happy to win the cup again.
What's important is the team and I'm glad I was able to help," said a passionate Garcia after the European victory.
He transfers duties to fellow citizen John Ram who defeated U.S. star Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a singles game on Sunday.
"I feel wonderful pride, defeating Tiger Woods, I was watching him when I was young," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches to France and now holds a record of 13–21–3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising figure from one of the highest-ranked players ever, having won 14 titles and being only the second to do so after Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team was overwhelmed with the entire weekend putting the ball on the grass except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a very high-scoring game in all competitions.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after the bottom game of his squad, "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
There were times this morning when we presented many challenges to the European team.
We fought.
A lot of respect for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of its players played very well.
We will reorganize, I will work with our PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will go ahead.
I love these 12 players and am proud to be a captain.
You have to give a compliment.
They controlled us."
