An event of the rapid increase of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, January 1 to 15 March 2020.
A growing development of the conditions of coronavirus (COVID-19) shows the same expense in countries of the European Union/ European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom to ensure that, although it is in separate states of the world, the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly spreading in all countries.
Based on Italian experience, countries, hospitals, and emergency units should increase their willingness to accept many cases of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, and especially care for the affected.
In 31 December 2019, a group of people with unknown atomic conditions were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the new coronavirus is now known as the superspiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV2).
Since then, the result of SARS-COV2 disease has been caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence available thus far shows that 80% of those with CoVID-19 suffer from a serious condition, that is, respiratory disease that is associated with or that does not relate to pneumonia, and many of these people are recovering.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is developing into a very serious illness that requires hospitalization while 6% of the remaining cases are dealing with a serious crisis that requires emergency care.
The deaths of patients who have been laid down because of COVID-19 are 4%.
In this study, we are studying the corresponding accounts for the development of CoVID-19 in each European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to those in Hubei Province, China.
It also compares the present number of people with COVID-19 countries in the EU/EA and the UK with that of Italy during January–15 March 2020.
CONVID 19 conditions in the EU/EA and UK
After China, COVID-19 was widely distributed and the global shift of the COVID-19 epidemic is currently following what is taking place in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the General Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 epidemic.
The 5 March of the Eurosurveilance 2020, Sporri et al. reported the first guaranteed people with COVID-19 in Europe, in harmony with WHO's definition.
EU/EA, the first confirmed people were reported by France in 24 January 2020 by the people who returned from Wunhan, Hubei Provence, China.
By 15 March 2020, people with COVID-19 had been found in every 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK), which is that between 31 December 2019 and that day, it was reported that 59,768 persons with the virus were infected and 1,727, this time 17,750 infected and 1,41 died from Italy alone.
To find an increasing number and an increasing event in the form of COVID-19s.
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), statistics of people worldwide, derived only from legal sources such as the National Health Service of every country, national and regional health powers and WHO, are renewed each day by 8:00 a.m.
This date was used to evaluate the temperature of the CoVID-19s in EU/EA and UK, and compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the development of the existing COVID-19 conditions, we calculate the increased development of the 14 days of the COVID-19 conditions, thus considering the natural continuation of COVID-19, in each state of the EU/EA and UK, during the period of 1 January 15 March 2020.
We also introduced an increasing number of reported world conditions on 15 March 2020 8:0 a.m. compared with Italy during January 31–15 March 2020.
COVID 19 in the EU/EA and the UK
Retirements of the 14 days of COVID-19 conditions in the EU/EEA and UK generally follow those of Hubei Province (China).
In all E/EEA and UK, the increasing event of COVID-19 began to increase in about 21 February and increased considerably in 28 February 2020 (Serability).
This is greatly increased by the rapid increase in the number of reported conditions from Italy, but all other countries in the EU/EEA and UK show the same rising costs in the developing episode of COVID-19 (Treadable fuel).
Picture 2 shows the increasing number of conditions of CoVID-19, in the EU/EA and UK compared with that of Italy during January 31–15 March 2020.
It highlights that, by 15 March 8:0 a.m., some 15 countries of the EU/EA and UK had already reported a total equal to that of Italy 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported conditions of COVID-19 rises rapidly in EU/EA and UK.
The statement indicated in the increasing event of CoVID-19 shows that the epidemic continues at the same rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries in different categories, varied in the way of public health response, and likely different explanations of conditions in countries as well as different protocrasulations for patients to be checked to confirm CoVID-19, which include follow-up tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian states described the situation when 10% of the COVID-19 patients needed emergency care and the media reported that hospitals and emergency units in these regions had reached their peak level.
The date of the entry of the COVID-19 conditions in the hospital and/or emergency unit is found in the EU/EA unit in 6% cases and only 1%, respectively (the date is not displayed).
It should, however, be gathered in an orderly way to correspond to the present alert radar focus on the number of reported conditions and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a major difference in the availability of emergency beds and central care in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in the population of 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less assets than Italy (12.5 emergency - care beds and private care units per 100,000 people by 2010–11).
To imitate the conditions associated with the total amount of health care, which provides an average of each state of the EU/EA and UK for the increase in conditions reported in the hospital for the risk related to the risk of 14: 90% of running out of the amount of emergency care, is given in a sixth return of the ECDC check for the emergency regarding COVI-19.
As conditions abound in certain states in the EU/EEA and UK states, and emergency hospitals and units are often helpful to some of the regional residents, knowledge about conditions and emergency - care beds should be found on the level of the Nomedical units for statistics 2 (NUTS2).
Italian experience along with recent international accounts shows that the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly growing in EU/EA and UK.
Countries, hospitals, and emergency units should prepare for the ongoing response of the SARS-COV2 officer and the increase in cases of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care, and especially serious care, as is the case in the regions affected in Italy.
As shown in a recent ECDC survey of an immediate danger, a quick, enthusiastic, and thorough approach is vital to delay the spread of SARS-COV2, by making changes from the control course to a slow process, since the rapid increase in the number of conditions may not allow the decision-time decisions and hospitals to allow for understanding, to accept and adapt their response to the proper course if not in advance.
A study of immediate danger also refers to public health measures for the control of the epidemic.
There is little space where the nations cannot continue to control their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-COV2 and reduce the pressure to health care.
Failure of this, it is possible that the chemicals to be treated in some EU/EEA countries will be confronted with a host of patients who need emergency care in the coming days or weeks.
Connavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by arspere respiratry syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS), presently killing more than 3,000 people and affecting more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, which have succeeded in a disaster for humans.
Like its same virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 is more critical and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmitted and more affecting older people than new ones and more male than women.
As a response to the rapidly growing number of printed material on the subject of early disease, this article is trying to provide an up - to - date and detailed review of the subject of rapid research.
We will consider the basic factors related to epidemology, metaology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
While many questions still require answers, we hope that this restoration helps to understanding and eliminate the threat of disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to stay in their homes on vacation and on many weeks after that because of the outbreak of a new virus.
The virus is much the same as coronavirus (COV) that caused arspere respiratry syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, it was named SARS-COV2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and a related disease was called CoV Disease 19 (COV-19).
The epidemic started in Wunhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and in about 50 other cases around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of CoVID-19, with more than 40,000 hospital patients and more than 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the leading enemy of society" and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https:/ww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 pages were printed regarding its COVID-19s, epidemiology, metaology, testing, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 determined the sequence of the virus separated from most patients.
This review is trying to bridge the progress of research on a new and rapidly progressive subject.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, the Middle East race syndrome (MERS, 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about prevention and the cause of disease as well as other vital questions that remain.
CoVs that are generally considered nonfatogens in humans are mainly responsible for 15% of the normal colds 4.
In this century, however, we have experienced twice that of the highest phogenic, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-COV, which caused the epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, in one way or another, and soon spread to other countries that caused serious illness and death.
Therefore, the present CoVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in the recorded history of the people.
As indicated at Death.1.1.1, there were unknown cases of pneumonia reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 in the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the COV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020 the first case of death was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, an appeal to health workers was reported, suggesting that human cooperation was possible.
On January 23, the city of Ouhan was searched and all public transportation was set up.
On January 24 the first medical study of the disease reported that only 41 patients with confirmed conditions had an accurate contact with the Wunhan sea food market that was considered the first place in the disease from an unknown source.
On January 30, WHO announced a global health crisis.
At the time of its report, disease has spread throughout China as well as about 50 countries around the world (Defa.2).
As the situation changes rapidly, both the end and the severity of the epidemic are unknown.
On February 11, 2020, a study of many facilities of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 that were confirmed with COVID-19 showed a more revised picture of the epidemic in the following way (https: / / /www.wiixin.q.com/ UlB-H_RHPHA1Hhar2bdA).
SARS-COV2 has been sick for all years, but mostly 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of sick people are over 50 years old, fewer than 20, and only 14 are under 10.
SARS-COV2 has caused more male cases (0.31/100,000) than women (0.57/100,000).
The CoVID 19 grew in groups mainly Hubei and near again.
The CoVID 19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the trial.
The average incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from beginning to death is 9.5 days [4.8-13].
The basic production number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the changed R0 was 2.23-4.82.2.
The number of people involved increased rapidly before 23 Jan. 2020, which was similar to the time of mass migration before Spring Festival in China.
The death of patients with confirmed conditions was 1.44% (95% C: 1,101.86%), and the changed mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major factors of the risk factors of CoVID-19 were sexual (men men), age (
The CVs are part of the family of the hidden supersonic bacteria that contain a single nerve RNA.
It can be divided into four parts, that is, the alpha, the beta, the gammama, and the delta, that is, the Alpha and the beta are known to add to the people.
The Spike (S) of glycoprotein membrane adheres to the welcome of angiotensin-conversing enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transptidyl peptive 4 (DP4) of SARS-COV and MENS-COV, respectively, and then there is an association of the membrane.
The gene of the RNA virus is released from cytolasm; after the replacement of the gene, RNA is a genetic component that is associated with glycoprote proteins and nacleopsid proteins make proteins that contain two types of antibodies, which include plasma membranes for the transmission of the virus.
The sequence of early SARS-COV2 genes was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with a germination of 99.98% between the 10 successive samples gathered in the first explosion area, the Huananwood Market in Wun.
SARS-COV2 is usually more similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Using a microscopic for transmission, SARS-CoV2 molecules were found in the most apparent parts of the epidhelium of the airway to humans.
ACE2 persons were found to be the SARS-COV2 channel and SARS-COV.
However, SARS-COV2 scans include a person's ACE2 faster than that of SARS-COV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-COV2 causes less serious reactions to patients than SARS-COV.
SARS-COV2 can also create a short new protein produced by orf3b and output protein produced by orf8.
The SARS-COV2 tool may play a role in the bugPactivity and may stop the appearance of IFN ; however, an rf8 contains no known background or motif.
In February 18, 2020, the Zou, et al, reported the ACEM Cyy-M building of people with a full height of 2.9 Å associated with the B0AT1 amino acid vehicle.
It was found that this linked, with open and closed buildings, was connected as a diamond and that a joint of ACE2-B0AT1 was able to combine two S proteins, which give evidence of the presence of CV and transmission.
B0AT1 may be a treatment unit for medication to suppress SARS-COV2.
Moderate Source and Organization
It is known that both SARS-COV and MENS-COV began on bats and passed on to the people by civet cats and the lawyers, respectively.
In comparison with SARS-COV2-COV2, bats are recognized as the SARS-COV2 source agency since the new virus corresponds to 96% and two SARS like SARS from the SL-CoVX45 bats bats bats and the SL-CovXX2 virus.
However, the organization that intervened helped the virus to cross the existing border between creatures so that it can introduce strangers to humans, and the channel of communication is still to be explained.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may be a carriers from bats to humans that involved the recombination of the same characteristics inside the S protein.
According to research, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that nonninlin - long noses, nitant mammals are commonly used as human medicines in China - it may be the central SARS-CoV2 association based on 99% of the genetic factors in the CoV found in individualins and SARS-CoV2.
However, the 1% difference spread between the two genes makes a big difference; hence, the sure effects of strong sperm are left. (Defa. 33)
SARS-COV2 chemical elements are not currently known.
SARS-CoV and MENS-COV can survive without a creature up to 48 hours in dry land and up to 5 days below 20 ° C and 40% 50%.
SARS-COV2 may have similar features.
Reportedly, SARS-CoV2 does not respond to ultraviolet radiation and temperatures of 35 ° C for 30 minutes; he is, 75% ethanol, chlobinolite, hyacic acid, chloform, and other fats, but not chloroxine, can make the virus ineffective.
All too often all people lack bodyguards representing SARS-COV2 and therefore are at risk of contracting a new virus.
In the meantime, no detailed research has been reported on the response of SARS-COV2 antibodies.
Therefore, we can refer only to previous investigations of some CVs, especially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Defa.4).
Usually, after the virus has hit the body, it is first identified by the natural receptor antibodies identified in the joint (PR) that include electrons like C, recerietor similar to Toll (TLR), an oral recesstor (NLR), and a non-receptor similar to IG (I-RR).
By different routes, the virus causes the display of the tumors, the development of endorritic cells, and the production of interferrons of I (IFN) that contract the spread of the virus and speed up the microphage pegocytosis antigensis.
However, N protein for SARS-CoV can help the virus to escape the immune response.
In the near future, a willing response to the immune system joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes that include CD4+ and CD8+ cells play an important role in protecting.
CD4+ T cells encourage B cells to produce antibodies that are connected to the virus, as well as T cells of CD8+ that directly kill infected cells.
The helper T cells produce proinflammary cytokine to help protect cells.
However, CV can prevent T cell function by producing T cells.
Humoral’s incontinence, including C3a and C5a and immunologic defenses, is also vital to the fight against infection.
For example, immune systems taken from a recovering patient make the MERS-COV ineffective.
On the other hand, excessive response to the body’s immune system produces a large number of rays in an area that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other parts of the body, and, in the worst of cases, a number of body organs and even deaths.
SARS-COV2, which has the first feature as a group, is more likely to treat adults with comorbidies and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of bacterial infections or who have immune systems, with a higher chance of transmission than others.
The average cause of SARS-COV2 respiratory conditions is 14 days, in many cases 3-7 days based on the study of the first 4225 people in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 people shows that the incubation period was 3 days on the average and had a total of 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, indicated that the period of massage was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on the knowledge of 8,866 persons.
It is very important for health authorities to change the period of quarantine based on the correct period of pregnancy, with such a range of people who are infected but who do not have any symptoms to pass the infection on to others.
As a general rule, people who are exposed, or infected, need to shut down for 14 days.
Should the curfew be extended for 24 days?
The fever is usually a large and early symptom of CoVID-19, which may not be related to symptoms or other symptoms such as coughing without coughs, loss of breath, muscle pain, spinal pain, headaches, severe throat, sinorhrhea, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients suffered dyspnea and/or hypopemia in one week after the onset of the disease.
In critical cases, patients rapidly developed severe respiratory problems, specic shock, mabolic acidosis, and coagulosis.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of breathing and serious fever, even if there are no unusual symptoms in the lung picture, should be treated for a first diagnosis.
A human knowledge study conducted at the end of December 2017 indicated that 98% of the symptoms were flu, 76% of non-speech, 5% dyspnea, and 3% of diarrhea patients; 8% needed to breathe with the aid of a machine.
Similar findings were reported in two recent surveys of the family circle as well as the group that results from the influx of people with no symptoms.
In comparison, a study of human knowledge in 2012 showed that people with MES-COV patients also had a fever (98%), a coughless cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed mechanical respiration, far more than covid - 19 patients and in accordance with the higher rate of the MERS deaths than CoVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and a painful throat (21%) were also noted for MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was shown that fever (9-100%), a cough without coughing (29%-75%), dyspnea (40% 42%%), diarrhea (20-25%), and a painful throat (13-25%) were major symptoms and breathing with the aid of a machine was required for about 14%%.
On February 14, the death caused by CoVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 6,576 around the world.
By comparison, SARS deaths due to November 2002 of 10% of all confirmed cases are 8,096.
In MEES, based on a study of human knowledge in June 2012, death was 37% of the confirmed 2,494 cases.
The first survey reported that R0 of SARS-COV2 was higher by 6.47 and had a 95% degree of self-security (CI) of 5.71-7.23, where the R0 of SARS-COV had a range of from 2 to 4.
comparison of SARS-COV2 with MENS-COV and SARA-COV as to their symptoms, death, and R0 are cited as Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-COV2 has a higher spread ability than MERS-CoV and SARS-COV, but has less destructive power than both.
Therefore, it is more difficult to control SARS-COV2 epidemic than MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
The start of the group often occurs in the same family or at the same gathering or transportation event that resembles a boat.
Patients often have a history of visiting or staying in the Wun or other affected areas or contacting people or patients in the next two weeks before the first one.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that hospital patients who have been treated are not able to carry the virus again, which provides warning to increase the time of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or limited number of peripheral white blood cells (particularly lymphocytes) in the initial stages.
For example, the lymphomania contains a number of white blood cells (< 4×109/L) that include the lymphocyte number of < 1×109/L, as well as the higher rates of sparate aminosferasse andviremia found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and amoglobin were high in the blood of other patients, and C-reactive Proteins and rythrocycytes were high in the blood of most patients.
For patients with serious illnesses, D-dimer’s condition, the production of fibriin in the blood, was higher, and the lymphocytes rate had drastically reduced.
An unusual discovery was found in the cardiography of many patients with COVID-19 and contained two - edged strakes or gill glass profiles in the lungs.
Patients often suffer from unusual pneumonia, severe lung damage, and acne respiratry syndrome (ARDS).
When ADS takes place, uncontrolled inflammation, increase of fluid, and progressive fibrosis endanger the gas exchange.
Type I and I-I am of pneuccyte reduces the level of surfactant and increases the pressure of the upper position, thus reducing the capacity of the lung spread and increases the risk of lung fall.
Therefore, the worst effects of radiation are often similar to the most critical condition of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first scan for cothatics of CoVID-19 showed the outbreak of pneumonia, the formation of the hyine membrane, and the introduction of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multindictated lymphocyte cells, along with the blood cells of the patient, which are associated with the spread of the disease, which is related to the spread of HIV and the ARDS and the same to those of SARS and MER.
The SARS-CoV2 discovery of RNA using RSNA-transcriptase lymerase Chainaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main subject of COVID-19 testing.
However, because of the high number of non-security vaccines, which may speed up the epidemic, medical visibility began to be used during testing (not relying only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred during SARS testing.
Thus, a combination of the history of disease, treatment, laboratory testing, and radiation effects is important and is essential for successful testing.
In February 14, 2020, the February Zhang group described a protocol to use the SSHERLOCK method based on CRISPR to locate SARS-COV2, receiving non-NNA fractions of SARS-CoV2 in 20 × 10-18 ml/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (100 copies of each module installed) for the use of a device that requires an incoming time without complex equipment.
It is our hope that the new approach will greatly improve empathy and benefits if assured in medical samples.
Because of a lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can primarily provide support to patients of CoviD-19, while trying a variety of previously used or pre-experienced treatments to treat others like SARS-COV and MERS-COV and other viral diseases (Ithub2).
The treatment includes current treatment and may include antibiotics, emmunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from upright patients, Chinese medicine, and mental help.
Even an proposal was made to use plasma to heal patients as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete with one another to create immune systems and goals against the virus.
SARS-COV2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and nearly again, to a minimum extent, other parts of the body that show ACE2, such as the estrogen and kidney pressure.
Nevertheless, failing to function and lack of breathing are a major threat to patients and is a leading cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is essential to reduce the symptoms and to save health and includes general oxygen treatment, high oxygen flow, air replacement, and air installation used by body - damaging devices for disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be based on the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO), a modified surgical procedure used to treat life - threatening heart or respiratory problems.
In addition, keeping in place of an electrolyte secretary, prevention and treatment of second exposures as well as specic shock, as well as the protection of vital body parts is also important for SARS-COV2 patients.
It is known that the cytokine hurricane is the result of an extreme response to SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine storm is the reaction of the cytokine process with the release of the cytokin series including TNF
These cytokines encourage the immune system to release a large number and freeradicals that are a major cause of ARDS and a number of body parts.
The pressure of the immune system is vital to the treatment of cytokines, especially for serious patients.
The cortcosteroids and toyzmab, anti-IL6 monol, have been used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other physical pressure treatment of the immune system includes the control of the body’s immune response directed to the T cell; the ban on IFN- peoples, LIFF, and TNF; the loss of JAK; the lantumomub; the suppressor of the use of the cytokine 4; and the HDAC links.
Steroids, such as memunosuppressants, are widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the risk of inflammation.
Steroids on higher levels, however, have not benefited from severe lung damage to SARS patients and COVID-19.
Rather, it may cause serious side effects, especially vascular oscular ostenonecrosis, which is a significant disturbance of prognosis.
Nevertheless, a short series of cortcosteroids in low-steroid levels to middle levels has been recommended to be carefully applied to severely ill COVID-19 patients.
By the time of writing, no effective treatment for combating infection had been established.
However, remsembling with remsesivir, which is a neurocleotide analog, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new drug against the virus that was first developed by Gilead for treatment of Ebola and Marlburg bacteria.
Later, remidesivir also indicated that he could prevent RNA bacteria with a single fibers connecting the MMERS virus to SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided a building in China to conduct studies to people with SARS-COV2, and the results have been viewed favorably.
In addition, baritigenb, interferon-
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after a combination treatment involving lepinavir/ritonavir.
The combination of these and other medicines used in patients should be taken into account.
Plasma from improved patients and the buildup of antibodies
The blood collection of healed patients from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy persons from contracting disease is far more than a long history.
In fact, recovering patients usually have a higher level of immune defense against their blood disease.
The immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight disease and other body wastes and are able to detect different cells in the disease and make them inactive.
Based on this, the plasma was collected in the blood of a group of healthy patients in CoVID-19 and was directed to 10 patients in a critical way.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by lower swellings and levels of infection as well as improved oxygen levels in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed in order to make the proposal that a procedure is widely used before a treatment can be improved.
In addition, in view of the side effects of treatment, some of the beneficial side effects associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, the immune system can be extremely encouraging to the immune system and causes cytokine, which may be a life - threatening risk.
The amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is too great for patients to be treated in a critical way.
It is difficult to build and produce some immune systems too quickly to fight a global epidemic.
As a result, it is very important and reasonable to divide the B cells of recovered patients and to mark the genetic codes of active genes or to divide the body’s active guards into representing the vital proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various forms of disease in China for thousands of years.
Its factors, however, depend largely on the combination of many parts in a variety of forms according to the study of disease based on the TCM vision.
Most of the working parts remain anonymous or obscure as it is difficult to identify and confirm such parts or their best - worked mixtures.
In the meantime, because of the lack of effective and accurate treatment of CoVID-19, TCM has become one of the major treatments of patients with mild symptoms to the middle of those who recover from critical stages.
For example, Shu Fung Jie Du pills and the Lian Hua Qing Wen tablets were found to be effective in the treatment of CoVID-19.
High levels of treatment for patients with CoVID-19 were noted in many Chinese states using TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, which used TCM about 30% of its cases with COVID-19, had a very low rate of recovery (13%).
This is an inaccurate comparison, however, since other factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the study.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study of the comparison between Western medicine (WM) alone and the combination treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the times necessary for the body temperature to recover, the symptoms run out, and hospitalization were shorter than the WM+TCM group alone.
Even more interesting, the level of exposure to symptoms (from small to critical) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM (7.4% compared to 64.2%) and deaths were lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM (8.8% compared to 9%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM are still waiting for well - supervised research at many major levels and institutions.
It may also be interesting that the course of action is marked and made clear that the active parts of TCM or its combinations are available if possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed of having coVId-19 tend to be more afraid of a very common and deadly disease, and people who are in custody are back on their knees, lonely, and aggressive.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and coughing and severe sleep effects such as cortcosteroids can lead to more anxiety and mental depression.
In the first phase of SARS’s outbreak, a number of psychological disorders that include chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mental retardation symptoms, psychiatric attacks, and even suicides were reported.
A series of forced communications and closings, as part of the public’s response to the explosion of CoVID-19, may cause many people to feel anxious and guilty about the consequences of joining, imprisonment, and the loss of family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided for those with COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having it, people with whom they contact, and the general community that they need.
Mental help should include the development of centers of mental health in many fields, clear communications that have regular and precise reviews on SARS-COV2 and treatment programs as well as the use of electronics and programs to avoid close relationships with others.
Practical goals are vital to the release of a chain from animals and infected persons to parasites that may be exposed and are often related to antimicrobial treatment in the control of new viruses.
Efforts have been made to set goals based on S protein to produce long-term and lethal antibodies and/or protection from SARS-CoV.
Determined ambitious goals have been examined in animals in connection with SARS.
However, these biological applications of these goals for adults as well as the death - defying models and their protection against infection from animals to humans are still to be discovered before medical research began.
This is because SARS was silent 17 years ago and no new illness has been reported since then.
On the other hand, the rare conditions and the MERCs continue to spring from the Middle East and spread in other regions because of the persistent resistance of biological agents to humans in disease areas.
Measurements have been made for MERS by the use of an unused virus, DNA plasma, virus valves, nanoparticles, microbes, and proteins in combination proteins and some have been examined by animal models.
Building a safe and active goal against SARS-COV2 people is an emergency and important work in managing the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to resist difficulties because of the long period (an amount of 18 months) that is needed to set a goal and the changing types of CoV.
Like a new disease, COVID-19 has just recently begun to show its treatment program full of thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients are able to recover slowly without the effects of the earlier illness.
However, like SARS andMERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a higher rate of illness and death in patients with serious illnesses.
Therefore, building a model for the cause of the disease is essential to health care services in order to establish its services first, especially in areas of subdivision.
Based on medical studies reported up to now, the following factors may affect or are linked to the cause of CoVID- 19 cases (The Table):
Age: Old age was the most important factor of SARS, which is also true of COVID-19.
COVID-19 appeared mainly in age 30-65 and 47% of those patients were more than 50 in the study of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients who needed emergency care had a higher risk of developing other diseases and more complex conditions and were significantly older than those who did not (66 years compared with 51), which suggests that age is a factor contributing to the effect on patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-COV2 has caused more males than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.527/100,000), as described above.
Diseases already present and complex: CoVID-19 cases requiring critical care have a higher risk of serious heart attack and arththmia.
Heart - related events once again became the leading cause of the death of SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-COV2 is also capable of adhering to the ACE2-politive lingaocytes, which may lead to liver failure in cases of COVID-19.
It is good to note that age and disease are already closely associated with solidity and can be disturbing.
Unusual bottle effects: C-reactive protein levels (CRP) in the blood show the danger of swelling or muscle damage and has been raised to indicate that it is the cause of disease, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
Reconstruction of the CRP rate and the risk and cause of COVID-19.
In addition, the high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the sparate aminorensferase (AST), the elanine aminometers (ALT), and the creitine scanase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely shown in many organs, especially in heart and liver, and are released during muscle damage.
As a result, they are common symptoms of heart failure or liver failure.
Major medical symptoms: chest diaography and temporary progression of medical symptoms should be considered together with other cases of the effects and complexity of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As described above, memmunosuppressant steroids are often used as an additional treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the risk of inflammation.
As the high number of cortcosteroids in the critical SARS patients, the majority of survivors suffered from vascular osteoarthritis with a lifelong disability and a poor standard of living.
As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used less and less time for COVID-19 patients.
Mental depression: As described above, during the outbreak of CoVID - 19 most patients suffered severe depression as they had to endure long periods of imprisonment and serious uncertainty and see the death of close family members and their fellow patients.
It is vital that mental counsel and support be given to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal health.
In keeping with human knowledge studies up to now, COVID-19 seems to contain aspects of epidemology that are different from SARS.
In addition to repeated in the lower respiratory cycle, SARS-COV2 is able to repeat easily in the upper respiratory tract and cause small or less symptoms in the first stage of exposure, in the same way as the normal CVs.
Therefore, patients who are involved in the first phase or the period of infection can produce a large number of infection during daily activities, causing great difficulty in the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-Covation was thought to occur when patients were very ill, while most exposures did not occur in the first phase.
As a result, the explosion of COVID-19 is more critical and difficult to control than the SARS explosion.
There are many current efforts in China that include the closing of the Wun and surrounding cities and the continuing ban on the entire population in hopes of interfering with the SARS-COV2 distribution.
Although these measures have caused serious economic and other areas of the world, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a reduction in the rate of epidemics.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the decrease rate will continue for 3-4 months.
Some scholars, however, do not.
Paul Hunter, etc al., estimates that the COVID-19, which seems to be more closely related than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a method of predicting the effects of an epidemic and suggested that SARS-COV2 may hold two thirds of the world population.
The Canadian team reported that SARS-COV2 was found in both the mid-turbinate and the patient's throats that recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly discovered virus may be a repeat chapter similar to the flu.
However, promising signals come from China on the basis of the drop rate of sick young people, indicating that current strategies may be working.
At first it was predicted that Ebola would affect one million people and that half a million people would die.
However, because of strict restraint and isolation, the disease is kept under control.
It may be, as SARS-CoVV, that SARS-CV2 may become weak and eventually die out or become a less ill-society virus that is able to deal with people.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MENS is given below (Defa.55).
SARS-COV2 is closely related to coughing or sneeze, and it may be through direct contact with infectious agents.
The virus was also found in the wild, giving fresh access to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 patients reported that 41% of patients may have been admitted to hospitals, including 17 patients who had previously suffered some diseases as well as 40 health workers.
Therefore, greater caution is needed to protect individuals, especially health - care workers, health - care workers, family members, friends, and even people standing near the sick or vulnerable.
The first line of defense that might be used to reduce the risk of exposure is wearing the masks; both the use of surgical masks and the N95 respirator (twind # 1860s) helps control the spread of germs.
The facial masks block fluids from a person that may be exposed to air and attached to the face of objects, where they can be passed on to other people.
However, just N95 masks (transparent # 1860s) can protect you from sniffing small buns by 10 to 80 mm, while only 5% of the binary are completely able to pass through; SARS-CoV2 has the same size as SARS-COV both about 85 mm.
Since the enzymes are able to pass through the five combined operations, medical surgeons who work directly with patients must wear N95 masks (twin # 1860s) rather than surgery masks.
In addition to the masks, health - care workers must wear adequate protective gear in order to reduce contact with germs further.
Microorganisms can penetrate a person’s eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor submitted to SARS-COV2 although he wore an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body by entering his eyes and swollen.
As a result, health - care personnel should also wear facial security guards that can display or look mirrors while working with patients.
In the general public in affected or possibly affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with a washcloth more often than usual, try to stay in the house to shut up and stop contact with people who may be contagious.
The three - dimensional distance is considered the right distance for people to stay away from patients.
These measures are practical ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV2 came as a new virus to the world of the people, its having the same structure as SARS-CoV as reported in January 2020 should be a warning in China because it still remembered the SARS explosion in 2003.
However, until 19 January 2020 the director of the Center of Disease Control in Louisiana assures residents that the new virus can be less infectious and less transmitted when it moves from one person to another and that it is not a problem to prevent and control the disease.
This message kept the public on the alert, especially when the whole country was preparing for Spring Festival, and they missed the crucial time for controlling the virus while it was still in Wuhan.
Chinese immunosuppressors may learn this crucial lesson and make vital progress in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more efficient when making public announcements as each name is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) they feel and respond more to unfamiliar information from a clinic than they wait for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) are more limited to controlling what may be a disaster while in its first stage than endeavoring to comfort the public; and (4) do more frequently to improve public awareness of the effects of infectious diseases and the social development of the public.
The explosion of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-COV2 virus at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China as well as about 50 other countries around the world when this was written.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, a rise in COVID-19 create the feeling that SARS is repeated.
However, there are significant differences between CoVID-19 and SARS, which are vital to control the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
CoVID 19 affects more older people and more males than women, and the risk and mortality rate is higher in adults than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared with 1.44%).
CoVID-19 patients pass the virus even when they do not have any symptoms while SARS patients pass it on when they are very sick, causing more problems in controlling the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-COV2 is spread faster and more widely than SARS-COV.
A general review of SARS-COV2 RNA may be involved in some cases of COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients who are treated may also become confused during the diagnosis.
The findings greatly increase the risk of infection.
As there is a rapid progress in the COVID-19 research, there are a few serious problems that need to be solved, including:
Where did SARS-COV2 come from?
Although it found that there is a 96% similarity between the gene building between SARS-COV2 and two SARS bats, we cannot conclude that SARS-COV2 comes from bats.
What animal in the center passed the virus from the first site, suppose bats, to humans?
If we do not know the answers for # 1 and 2, we cannot successfully cross the transmission, and the passage can be worse at any time.
Although cell models and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-COV2 adheres to ACE2, how does the virus actually get into the respiratory cell and cause changes that cause the resulting illness?
Does the virus also attach itself to cells that show ACE2 in other parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get an accurate, accurate diagnosis and a effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How do the genes of the virus change during intersecting?
Will it become a global epidemic, will it end like SARS, or will it be worse occasionally than a cold?
It is important, but it may take some time to consider the answers to the above questions and many more.
Regardless of the cost, however, we have no choice but to prevent the epidemic as quickly as possible and restore our health to a normal condition.
The origin of the virus from animals to man’s coronavirus people
The change and flexibility have promoted the coronavirusco and its organization, which include people, thousands of years.
Before 2003, two people's CoVs (HCOVs) were known to cause minor diseases, such as common colds.
The explosion of a spiratry syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratry syndrome (MERS) has changed the situation to indicate how much damage HCOV can cause and can threaten life.
The appearance of SARS-COV2 in central China at the end of 2019 puts the Cos and surprised us with a higher probability but with a reduced levelity compared with her SARS-COV sister.
HCOV is zomenosis and understanding the causes of HCOV can help us.
Many HCEVs are from bats and do not cause disease in them.
Half-particular NPOs of some HCVs are also known.
Identifying animal predators has a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.
Research on the interaction of the CV network to animals may provide some important insight into the development of the CV in humans.
In this review, it introduces a glimpse of the already available information about the seven HCEVs, and it will focus on the history of their discovery and their origin of the Amazon and the intersecting of various creatures.
More important, we compare and divide HCEVs with the theory of mutations and gene combinations.
The present COVID-19 epidemic of CV (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for the successful reversal of the industry as well as the effects of the microbe in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) are part of the Cornalidae family, which is made up of a group of bacteria, with a opozbitu, which has the unique RNA virus.
These bacteria contain the largest of the 26 to 32 kilobases between RNA bacteria that are called "CV" because of their morphology that looks like a crown under the electron microcope.
According to the structure, the CVs consists of non-genmeal elements that have the same order.
Nearly three quarters of the frame have two large open reading frames linked to each other (ORF1a and ORF1b), translated to be replicase polyproteins of pp1a and pp1b.
The polyproteins are more closely treated to build 16 extra proteins without a building, called inp1 ~6.
The rest of the frame contains ORF proteins of the building, including Spike (S), a glass (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of synapses corresponding to the list also has a code of various CV lists.
Based on a different set of proteins, the CoVs are fitted in four categories (alpha-COV, beta-CoV, gamma CoV and delta-COV), where the beta-COV field contains most HCOVs and is divided into four categories (A, B, C, and D).
The evidence for phylogenics has shown that bats and mice are a source of the alphabet-CoV genes and beta-Covs, while birds are the source of gamma-CoVs anddelta-COV.
For thousands of years, there has been a steady flow of the CoVs which are being passed over the boundaries of creatures and most of them have become important to humans.
So far, seven people (HCoVs) were known.
Between HCOV229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five-bata-CoV includes HC43, HCOC3, HCOV-HKE1, specitry syndrome (SARS-COV), the Middle East respiratry syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CV2.
HCOV229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 often causes small symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-COV2 recently discovered are causing serious illness, resulting in serious respiratory infections in a large number of patients that contribute to high levels of spiratry syndrome (ARDS) and other diseases that occur outside the lungs.
The first type of HCOV229E, B814, was divided into the noses of patients with common cold colds in the mid - 1960s.
Since then, more information has been obtained on the detailed research of HCOV229E and HCOV-OC43, both of which are contributing to the withdrawal symptoms.
In fact, the idea was adopted that HCEV treatment was generally safe until SARS erupted.
SARS outbreaks in 2003 are one of the most tragic in modern history, affecting more than 8,000 people and had a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreaks of the Middle East respiratry syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that is a rare outbreak in some parts of the world.
The new HCOV of 2019 (2019-nCOV), later known as SARS-COV2, is the cause of the 2019 coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 9,000 people on March 3,20.
The alarm has been crying and the world should be ready for the approaching SARS-COV2 epidemic.
All seven HCEVs have the origin of the Amazon from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Many evidences support the origin of all HCEVs from bats, where bacteria are properly adaptable and do not cause disease but indicate a wide variety of genes.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented serious challenges to medical, scientific, social, and moral health in China and the world.
A sequence of HCOV’s biological roots provides a range of insight into the natural history, motivating forces and interspersing factors of the jump.
This can also guide or aid in determining the cause, the middle and the production of copies of the SARS-COV2 entity, which will play an important role in the prevention of future transfers.
In this review it introduces a contraction of the biological origins, the combination of different creatures, and the HCovogenesis.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the same fact that HCOV - parent microbes do not usually cause sickness in their natural environment but cause sickness after it joins different creatures with a new one.
We also reverse the HCOV report in which the increase in participation often occurs and the drop of phogenity.
The effects of the continuing SARS-COV2 explosions are discussed again in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930 ’ s.
Before the initial division of the type of HCOV229E, B814, from which came from the noses of patients who had contracted the normal flu, the different Covv14s were separated from a variety of mixed animals, including garlic, rats, cow, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven HCEVs have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV’s findings (The Table 1) may be beneficial and educational.
The first type of HCOV229 was separated from the respiratory system of those with upper respiratory infections in the year 1906, and was adopted to develop in the WO8 lung cells.
HCOV229E patients had symptoms of common cold, including headaches, coughing, radiation and sore throats, and fever and coughing were seen in 10% cases.
Later in 1967, HCOV-OC43 separated the tissue from the tissue organ and the next range effort in the brain of nursing rats.
HcoV-OC43 seems to be similar to those caused by HCOV229E, which was not separated by symptoms in contact with other respiratory infections such as A virus and hhinoviruses.
Both HCOV229E and H CoV-OC43 are globally widespread, and they are often associated during winter in good weather.
Usually, less than one week of bacterial infection is under attack, followed by about 2 weeks of infection.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy people with HCov229E experience a minor cold.
Only a few patients with stress antibodies showed a serious respiratory disorder.
SARS, also known as "imposible pneumonia", was the first scourge caused by HCOV recorded in human history and is the cause of SARS-COV, the third HCOV located.
The first sARS disease can be traced to the end of 2002 in China’s Guangdong Provation.
The SARS epidemic led to a report of 8,096 patients and 774 people who died, scattered throughout many countries and continents.
In addition to the major triggerers, it was estimated that each case could cause at least two other incidents, during a period of 4 to 7 days, and the height of the virus occurred on the 10th day of the disease.
SARS-CoV patients initially seemed to be suffering from amalgia, headaches, fever, malaria and fever, followed by dyspnea, coughing, and breathing pressure as later symptoms.
The lymphofonia, a wrong liver test, and high level creitine canase are among the most unusual of the characteristics of the SARS.
The spread of alvelar, epithelic cell, and the increase of macrophages are noted in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients need emergency care and air conditioning.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, many body organs involving the prostatintes, liver and kidney can also be exposed to these critical conditions, often accompanied by the cytokine storm, which may kill particularly in patients with antibodies.
The virus was first separated from open lung surgery by a relative of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, major efforts have been made in HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was separated from the 7-monthly child of the Netherlands by late 2004.
It was first discovered that it had spread to young children, to elderly people, and to patients with antibodies who had respiratory infections.
Cyza, conjunctitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in HCOV-NL63.
One independent study described the separation of the same virus from an eight - month - old young man who suffers from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although found in the Netherlands, it is actually widespread.
It has been estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of normal respiratory infections, and its higher risk occurs early in summer, in spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with the obstactive laryngitis, also known as macrop.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old male who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the common pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 was reported to be related to the steopic acid mateation.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV229E and HCOC43, HCOV-HU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory infections.
All of these HCEVs present in society are very flexible and often have little chance of change to become more pitogenic diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons as in a rare form of sub-NL63 type that is most lethal, it is reported to cause serious respiratory disease in China.
Often, when these HCEVs develop the ability to absorb and keep them in constant condition within the human community, they kill or have a lower risk of death or photogenic.
The MENS-CoV was first separated in 2012 from the lung of the 60- year- old case case of serious pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the documented conditions are from the Middle East, the conditions in which are introduced are spread to close-to-pounders in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The appearance of MERS is similar to that of SARS, which is marked by a developing serious pneumonia.
In contrast with SARS, many MERS patients suffered serious kidney failure, which is presently a different thing for MERS among HCOV diseases.
More than 30% of patients have prostate symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases of fatal deaths were reported with 34.4% high death rates, making MERS-COV one of the most dangerous microbes in humans.
From mid-December 2019 to the end of it, many cases of pneumonia known as being related to SARS-COV2 were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization called the rise of the lower respiratory disease caused by SARS-COV2 the Public Health Risk for Global Health and named it Covid-19.
On March 3, 2020, it was reported that there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, 3.4% of deaths.
Significantly, the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the other outside is 1.2%.
SARS-COV2 causes a serious respiratory problem such as SARS-COV and MENS-COV, which is introduced as a fever, cough and dyspnea.
Patients also suffer from diarrhea.
The pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can soon develop into a high - risk blood pressure syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-COV2 are nearly identical because of the same set of nucleotide that is 82% high, there are separate groups in the phytogenic branches.
SARS-COV2 appears to be a partial phagenic but is more closely related than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
It has been reported that there are people who do not have symptoms with SARS-COV2 and may be contributing to the rapid worldwide increase.
Comparing SARS-COV2 with six other HCEVs presents the same as the most interesting difference.
First of all, the period of contraction and the length of period for the progression of HCV is very similar.
In this regard, SARS-COV2 follows the average of six other HCEVs.
Second, the seriousness of the symptoms of CoVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four HCOV229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
SARS-COV2, on the other hand, shows the most common symptoms during exposure to HCEVs, which include the absence of clear symptoms, small symptoms or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a lower set of subsidized conditions of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-COV disease, although the ratio is low.
Third, SARS-COV2 links interesting patterns with both HCEVs available to the public as well as SARS-COV.
On the other hand, SARS-COV2 is as high as HCEVs found in the community.
On the other hand, it will still be confirmed if SARS-COV2 transmission is declining to the people as in the case of SARS-COV andMERS-COV.
Finally, as with other HCEVs, SARS-COV2 can be found in samples in the field.
Whether the SARS-COV2 oral transmission plays an important role when it comes to SARS-COV under certain conditions will still be clarified by future researchs.
It is also very interesting to see whether SARS-COV2 will show the appearance of certain periods of the year as is the case with HCEVs available in the public.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CV2 which include its attachment, the atmosphere and the safety of the spread after the human transfer will have an effect on the final conclusion of the collapse of COVID-19.
All HCEVs found in the community cause small symptoms to be closely linked to people.
According to one opinion, it may also be true that people are perfectly compatible with the four HCEVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCOV epidemic.
HCEVs cause serious illnesses in people and people with severe HCEVs are no longer present.
For this to happen, HCEVs must return to the people to a reasonable extent to allow for the development of changes in conditions that are in harmony with the circumstances that conflict with the features of the creation of the corporation.
In this way, if SARS-COV2 outbreaks persist and contribute to large numbers of people, there will be a greater chance that it will become more humanly compatible.
If they fit together too well, it can be difficult to block it by closing it or by other means controlling reconciliation.
For many years, four coVs have been found in the community around human society, causing common cold in people who have the proper response to antibodies.
These germs need no animal source.
On the contrary, SARS-COV and MERC-COV in the extended extended human society has not yet been able to adapt well to people and their interaction within the community cannot be maintained.
They need to keep themselves in position and grow up in their source of nanoticism and want the opportunity to go to vulnerable victims, likely with one or more of the middle class and to raise the unsaids.
SARS-COV2 has the same factors as both SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCEVs obtained from the public.
It is relatively accessible as HCOV found in the community, at least in the original creature.
However, phogenic is much higher than HCEVs that are found in the public and has a lower baseogenic to SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It will still be seen if it will fully adapt to humans and move around without the source or assistance of an animal in the middle.
Before discussing the origins of HCOV animals, it will be helpful to discuss the explanations and aspects of change, natural, source, middle and HCOV development.
The animal becomes an HCOV converter if it covers the closely related ancestor that shared with him with high homology at the level of the nucleus.
The humanpeic virus often adapts well and does not cause disease in the tumor.
In a similar way, the source network stores HCOV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the unsaids are naturally accessible and are natural visitors to HCOV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCOV is reopened to the central or central agency of people, it is not well compatible with the new organization and often causes sickness.
This central entity may be a source of the ozone layer and play a role in the development of an organization that allows the virus to multiply for a while and to be passed on to humans to increase the level of exposure.
HCOV can experience a final recovery if it is not possible to maintain its attachment within the central community.
On the contrary, HCEVs are able to adapt to the central organization and even develop long - term decibels.
In this setting, the central community becomes a natural resource.
The epidemiological calendar showed that in the latter view, the SARS patient had a history of contact with hunted animals.
The subsequent seroprevalence studies showed that game merchants had IgG against SARS-CoV as high as the average population.
Masked palm chivets (paguciva larvavata) and the racoon dog of living animals have been found to carry viruses such as SARS-COV are similar to SARS-COV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS was reported after the execution of all the civets in the market.
However, it has been reported that wild mask elm civets or unpretentious farms in the game markets of living animals were dangerous when it came to SARS-COV, suggesting that the Masked palm chivets may be a central breeding agency but not the natural source of SARS-COV.
It is noteworthy that 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies against SARS-CoV, we cannot ignore the possibility that most mammals are the main producer of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the last cause of SARS-CV.
A study that followed this natural SARS-COV animal introduced a closely related CoV of bats, called SARS-related Rhinolopos vat HKU3 (SARR-RRh-BatCOV HKU3), found in bats called the Chinese horse's shoe.
These dynamite bats when it comes to immune systems against SARS-COV and SARS-Rh-BatCOV HKU3.
This and other opposing CVs belong to 88-92% of the social networks of the nucleus and SARS-COV.
These studies have led to the development of a new idea that bats can help new petogens.
SARS like SARS (SL-CoVs) are marked on bats, but none except the one calledWV1 were able to be classified as a living bug.
The ANgiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of people is known as the SARS-COV extension.
WIV1 taken from a bull's surface sample was shown to use a bug, a civet, and an ACE2 of people as an introduction to the cell.
Interestingly, SARS's mild prostate was able to killWV1.
Thus far,WIV1 represents the closely related SARS-CoV ancestor of the bats, sharing in 95% of the host's nucleus.
Although there is a higher hemoglobin between these two bacteria, it is generally believed that wIV1 is not the nearest parent virus of SARS-COV and bats that had the nearest SARS-CoV network.
phylogenetics include MENS-COV and the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKO5.
The CV-HUK 4 bats and MERS-COV use the same company response, the Diptidyl peptidase 4 (DP4), in the entry of the virus.
The RNA sequence of RNA dependent on the RNA of MES-CoV is closer to their anti-progenetal sub-CoV cota-CoVsies, which are found in Europe and Africa.
So far, no lifeMERS-CoV is found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative COV-HKU 25 of the bats shared only by 87% of the oxygen sequence of the nucleus.
As a result, bats may not be the nearest source of MENS-COV.
On the other hand, surveys in the Middle East have shown that the serospace camel is directly related to the bodyguards that kill MES-CoV, like camels from the Middle East in many countries of Africa.
Living MES-CoV like a virus from people was separated from the condomedary contraption of camels, which further showed that camels are a real source of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that often small symptoms were seen but the major transmission of the virus of the virus has been applied to the MERS-COV research.
Significantly, it is that mixed camels not only take out of the respiratory tract but also in the mouth’s mouthway, which is also the principal route for the removal of the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as many of MelS’s illnesses do not have a history of communication with camels before the onset of symptoms, it may be that interspersions from one person to another or some unknown internal network involving unknown animals covering the MERS-COV.
SARS-COV2 shared 96.2% of the UN referred to the 1996.2% and the CoV RATG13 bug separated from Rhinolopus affinis bats.
As is true of SARS-CoV and MERS-COV, a variety of sequence between SARS-COV2 and RATG13 is too great to be assigned to parent relations.
That means, bats may have had a nearby SARS-COV2 network unless nearly identical CVs are found in the future.
It is thought, the middle - class SARS-CoV2 should be among the animals that are sold and killed at Huananfood Wholesale Market, most of which were related to the first disease of CoVID-19, indicating that there may have been an event of inter-conseration between animals to humans.
A few recent studies based on the metagenomic sequence have suggested that a group of small mammals known as lincilins (Manis javanica) may have developed adult beta-COV associated with SARS-COV2.
These new segments of the non-convincial CoV are parallel in 885-92% of the numology of the nucleus and SARS-COV2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 with about 90% identity in the number of nucleotide sequences.
They come together into two lower categories of bacteria like SARS-COV2 on a phylogenetic tree, one of which shares the bases of the most closely related component (RBD) and SARS-COV2, with a sequence of amino acid.4%.
In sharp contrast, SARBDS-COV2 and RATG13 are very different, although there is a higher proportion of the wide output of homeology.
A previous study of sick linlinins reported the discovery of contaminated contags in lung samples, which seem similar to SARS-COV2.
The study used various construction methods and hand-built arrangements to build a sequence of half the gene built about 86.3% of the total length of the virus cell.
We cannot set aside the opportunity for the concalin is one of the nearest sARS-COV2 creatures.
At present, however, there is no evidence to support that lancilin is the correct source of SARS-COV2 because of a sequence of sequence between SARS-COV2 and SARS-COV2 of the non-indivis associated with beta-CVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV2 and RATG13 is much shorter between SARS-COV2 and SARS-COV2-COV2 galaxies related to beta-COV.
SARS-CoV2 conversion efforts to bats, mangolins and other mammals are still to be found.
Although a higher proportion of supercommology is derived from RBD between SARS-CoV2 and non-incilin, SARS-COV2 associated with beta-COV, SARS-COV2 and RaTG13 share a higher RAMology of the wide circle.
There are higher complaints that the high proportion of the RBDs in SARS-CV2 of the numbers associated with the beta-COV and SARS-COV2 being driven by the conversion of connected contacts by choice.
Another proposal recommends a reasserting between SARS-COV2 of the rings associated with beta-COV and RATG13 to the third wild animal.
As the force actuating the conversion, reunification is widespread among the beta-Covians.
The end has not yet been reached as to the nearest source of the SARS-COV2.
Apart from HCotogenics, the source of the ozone of HCOV229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HU1 has also been investigated.
The evidence for phylogenetics has shown that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV229E may have started on the opposing COV-OC43 virus, while the parent virus in HCOV-O43 and HCKU1 have been found in rats.
It has been reported that a bats's Cov (Arcov.2 Applachian Ridge CoV) obtained from North America's three - color bat showed close association with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV229E was a genetic link to another bats's CoVVV, called Hipposides/Ganas Kwam/19/2008, located in Ghana, while camereds have been suspected of being its nearest association.
To explain, current knowledge about the origins of the well - known HCOV animals is reached in Photo 1 and Table 2.
The analysis of phytogenetics has given evidence of the factors of HCOV co-operation in history.
When HCOC43 came from another animal to be passed on to humans from domestic animals about 1890, a plague of respiratory disease was recorded.
The history of the combination of various life forms of HCOV229 is not very clear.
An additional HCOV229E was discovered.
Among them is the Alpha-COV of the Alpaca.
A few evidences support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First of all, people not alpacas are likely to contact bats in the same environment.
Instead, people are closer to the alpacas.
Secondly, various HCOV229-CVs and do not cause infections in bats, while the alpha-Copaca virus caused an outbreak of respiratory disease to animals.
Finally, the Alpaca alpha has not yet been found in wild animals.
As a result, we will not ignore the possibility that alpacas get HCOV229E from people.
In fact, bats are a direct source of bacteria that cause human diseases that include the virus of the rabbis, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may have transmitted HCOV229E directly to the people.
On the other hand, when the satanic alpha-CoVs function as a set of HCOV229E genes, the Alpacas and dromedary camels may be the central agency that transmits the virus to humans, as is the case with MENS-Cov.
MERS-CoV is a good example of the inter-containing of different creatures from bats to humans.
The origin of the MERS-COV transition from bats is known in its first study and confirmed by the following findings.
It is evident that bats provide a wide range of microbes with the possibility of exchange of genetic components between different animals and the intersecting of different animals.
Long health, dense colonies, close social attachment and the ability to fly are all ideal conditions for bats to become a good microbeer'.
On the other hand, for centuries MENS-CoV has been introduced to a dromedary camel.
It is well adapted to these camels to turn into a middle - class organization that is stable and a natural resource.
MERS-CoV causes less disease and has a lower rate of alteration in these animals.
Its appeal to humans is wrong and people remain the last MERS-CV organization since its transfer cannot be maintained.
In contrast with the role of camels in sending MERS-CoV, the role of inininins, if available, in the SARS-COV2 distribution is different.
In particular, the condomlin beta-CoV causes a serious side effect on the canlins.
He may be the last party of the Best CoV associated with SARS-COV2, in terms of SARS-COV2.
SARS-COV2 interactions from animals to humans should be taken into consideration or not considered in future studies.
First, bats may be a source of a virus related to SARS-COV2 similar to SARS-COV2.
People may play the same role as bats in animal surgery or coal mining.
Second, the incalins may be the central breeding unit in which a virus related to SARS-COV2 has recently been introduced.
People are infected by surgery and eating stolen meat.
It may be that many mammals including domestic animals can be exposed to SARS-COV2.
An examination of the bodyguards of domestic and wild animals is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and replacement of SARS-COV2 may happen to a third animal connected with both bats and non-incisils.
SARS-CV2 is still in progress.
Apart from the various kinds of animals, there are three major factors on the side of the virus that are vital to reducing the Covs across the natural limit.
First of all, their high rate of change in RNA frequency.
Compared with other RNA bacteria that have a single fiber, the ratio of the CV changes may be viewed as "small" to "higher" on the rate of changes per year by each unit of 2 centres, depending on the level of the COV response to new hosts.
CoVs have seismicles to search for errors, removal results in extremely high changes and loss of energy or lack of proper growth.
Interestingly, the nucleotide allue Remsesivir is known to suppress the CV by preventing the corivoloclea and RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Remmediavir is one of the most promising agencies against SARS-COV2 for medical research.
Nevertheless, the rate of CV changes is about a million times higher than the number they do not know.
In addition, the number of changes is often higher if the COV is not properly compatible with the Society.
Compared with SARS-CV with the number of major changes, the value of SARS-COV2 changes appears to be low, suggesting a higher level of human co-operation.
Supposedly, it may already have been added to another social service.
In addition to SARS-COV2, this has also been applied to MENS-CoV, which is in full agreement with dromedary camels.
It is thought that genetic mutations may not be possible to cause anti-SARS-COV2 viral infections and antibiotics to slow down.
Second, the main RNA gene on the CoV is using more flexibility in the conversion of the graph to change and recombination, thus increasing the possibility of co-evolution of various creatures, which is beneficial for the appearance of new CV when conditions are convenient.
This is supported by many different separate reading formats and the function of the protein produced for the 3 meeting of the frame.
Third, chronic CVs suddenly changed the models during RNA's repeated in a different way "to copy".
For a company that serves as a mixture, a change of type occurs regularly during the CV RNA transfer.
The RNA homologouss with full length and sshwaenomic may reunite to build new CoVs.
The evidence of natural regeneration is derived from both HCOV-HKU1, HCOC43, and animal COV-COC43, along with animal COV-CoVs of bats and bat COV-HKU9.
Integration of the virus with an agency in connection with transmission
Apart from the three factors of the virus mentioned above, the union of the virus with the virus is another major factor that has an impact on the interaction of different creatures.
Here, the reunification of SARS-COV is regarded as a common example, which showed evidence of extreme choices between the events of inter-constitution.
Based on contrasting revisions between separated persons and the SARS-COV sub-Civic, it is thought that SARS-COV is facing immediate reactions to the different types of behaviors, especially with changes in the RBD pattern of S.
Generally, RBD in the S Promology of the CV cooperates with a cell host and is carefully chosen for the immune response of an organization’s immune system.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in 38 amino acids to 510 in part S1, which adheres to a person's ACE2 and its coceors to enter the virus.
SARBD SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 hosts of different animals, including male, civet, mouse and raccoon dogs, which allow the infection of different creatures.
In fact, only 6 residues of amino acids that have been found to be different from the separation of the human virus and the 4 RBD virus from the RBD that are found in the motif that adheres to the channel to deal with the ACE2 server.
SARS-Cov of Civet has a change of K479N and S487T to its RBD, which may increase the amount of contact with the SARS/COL scan and the ACE2 channel.
In other words, this change in two amino acids may be vital to the transmission of the virus to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-COV2 has the same cell command and SARS-COV.
The difference of 30% between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-COVV in S-CV unit of S Protea (S) means that the level of combination of S/S/ACE2 people may have changed.
In fact, the study of cryo-EM shows a higher rate of curves from 10-20-inch than between the ACE2 people and SARS-COV protein.
It will also be interesting to decide if another condition is needed in SARS-COV2 access.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is also attached to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are other HCOV channels, such as aminoptisize N in HCOV229E, and 9-O-acetylated isic acid of HCOV-OC43.
They may also be viewed as a reason for the successful transmission of the CV to humans after the combination of different creatures from their animal counterparts.
In addition to cell reactions, the result of the union of different types of HCEVs is also governed by the dependence on another creature and its limitations.
The diversity of these unique proteins between humans and nonsocieties is a natural source of HCEVs as bats, dromedal camels, and rats may create a barrier between different creatures.
HCEVs should take over the characteristics of dependent on the owner and interfere with the characteristics of the organization’s movement movement in order to produce a successful combination of creatures.
In this regard, cell - size decisions in this important area are still to be seen and marked.
A wide range of graphs on the basis of the creation of an organization and SARS-COV2 reproductive factors using modern CRISP technology may be beneficial.
New HCov arises: return to start
Negotied CV differences offer many opportunities for new HCEVs.
In this sense, satanic CoVs serve as a group of HCOV genes.
In addition, rapid changes and mutations also promote HCOV evolution and serve as two vital steps in this process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genetic factors that make up a new protein code has the power to alter the pathotypes of the virus.
Among SARS-CoV proteins, ORF8 are thought to be important in human relations, since the sARS-COV virus related to SARS-CoV is divided but found to produce different orF8 proteins.
The removal of the SARS-CoVs has been found in types separated from the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal distinguishes ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a flexible change that promotes the revolution.
Besides, SARS-COV may have a history of recombination with alpha and gamma CV lists, where a large number of recombinant areas were found in the small recombinant at RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Reconstruction areas were also recovered from innsp9, in large part of annp10, and in parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MES-CoV epidemic has experienced reunited events between various lists, which occur as a result of a combination in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MENS-COV, the events of recombination have been observed in some HCoVs, where HCEVs are reunited with other animal CoVs in their non-building genes.
It should also be recognized that the selection of the artificial may contribute to unpredictable changes in the immune cells, which may result in releasing the bacteria from the hydraulic agents used, such as those of the immune system's antibodies.
An example of this results is the loss of ORG4 complete length in the HCOV229E version, due to the double removal of the nucleus.
Although the total ORF4 was seen on anti-viral bacteria related to HCOV229E, the Alpaca CopaV indicates the installation of one nucleus, which leads to the change of the frame.
Finally, but important, new HCOV conversions are also under pressure to choose from its source's clients.
There were no symptoms or only minor symptoms found when bats were introduced with the CoV, showing a similar link between the CoVs and bats.
It seems that bats are well adapted to the CoVs in terms of structure and method of operation.
For example, an emergency in response that encourages inflammation in bats greatly reduces the risk of the risk of leadology introduced by the CoV.
Besides, the natural killer function of bats is stressed because of the increase in the reaction of the organ of the natural killer NTG2/CD94 and the low level of display of the blood cells in the complex part of the hestocomatic system.
In addition, the higher levels of oxygen - response creatures (ROS) built by the task of feeding the high-specimens may affect both the pressure of the COV replacement and the testing of errors with xoribonuclese, thus providing the pressure for the selection of the selection of the primary types of phogenic bacteria when they are introduced to a new organization.
More phogenic levels may also change by recombination, leading to the discovery of new proteins or protein components of the association of the Society.
As a result, it is not only fortunate that three new HCEVs have developed in the past two decades.
CoVs do not cause or cause small symptoms for their main entertainers such as bats and camels.
They return quickly without encouraging a strict response to the immune system.
Here are some secrets as to why sufferers who do not have symptoms are identified and what causes critical conditions in people’s health.
The most serious symptoms are due to the increased use of antibodies and the cytokine storm when there is strong immune response, the damage to the lungs is far more serious.
In contrast, for those who do not display any symptoms, the immune response has been twice divided into CV recurrences.
The same plan of dividing the immune response may have beneficial results in treatment against SARS-COV2.
The interferon response is particularly strong for bats.
As a result, the use of I-interferon type in at least the first stages of SARS-CV2 should be beneficial to the people.
In addition, the use of NLRP3 inflammasomes is ineffective.
According to this reasoning, NLP3 inflammasome in MCC950 may be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-COV2 appearance follows the usual stage of SARS-COV appearance and MERS-COV.
Although there has been a copy of a bulla-CoV that shared in 95% of the nucleusoption homology and SARS-COV, there is also the bug's CV that shared in 96% of the UNucleotide homology and SARS-COV2.
Although civets and other commercial animals have been found to carry bacteria such as SARS-COV, local-COVs have not yet been found.
It has been found the sARS-COV2 bearings that are similar to SARS-COV2, which indicate that the incalins may be some middle - or non-Comins may contribute to parts of the genes in the last version of SARS-COV2.
While the questions remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CV2 has been deliberately created by man or by accident.
The CoVs have returned to the theater because of the recent explosion of SARS-COV2.
The research of the CoV on bats and other animals has greatly changed our view of the importance of the sources of the ozone and the HCEVs in the interaction of humans.
Public evidence shows that SARS-COV, MERC-COV and SARS-COV2 have a central origin and is transmitted to the public by middle offs.
Since SARS-COV connection between people and market civets, closing living meat markets and killing civets could have ended the SARS epidemic.
In the same opinion, the incalins should be removed from the bionotic market to prevent, considering the discovery of many lists of cota-Covins closely related to SARS-COV2.
However, whether it is transmitted and how SARS-COV2 is transmitted to humans by canlins and other mammals will still be explained in future wakes.
MERC-CoV, on the other hand, has been present for a long period of time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as the main source of meat, honey, skin, and cosmetics among local people.
It is widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is unlikely that all camels will be killed to be controlled by MERCS, as happened in China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-COV2.
To prevent the recurrence of MENS, an extended method should be used to develop practical goals against the MERS-CoV of the camels, which are accompanied by other measures to control the disease.
Unable to eliminate the bacteria, new genotypes may appear to trigger the outbreak.
The variety of Zonotic CoVs revolves around the wilderness.
In particular, the enemy CoVs are powerful of the very different kinds of nanotics.
There are many opportunities for these Zonotic Covs to change and reunite, resulting in new CVs that are more likely to become active and more likely to kill people in the future.
The custom of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MENS, and COVID-19 cases, there should be a better program of preparation and response.
In fact, many microbes have long existed in the world.
They stay in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to leave.
Although bats have many factors that promote the spread of germs, the possibility of people contact bats and other wildlife can be reduced if people are taught that they are away from them.
The ongoing care of mammals is needed to better understand CoV’s ecology and its natural associates, which will be useful in preventing the transmission from being introduced from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In the final analysis, the best way to prevent the ozone layer is to keep humans from being isolated from the natural sources of ozone.
A few portions of the sARS-COV2 source pizzle have not yet been found.
First, if the bats transmit the sARS-CoV2 virus to the innins, it will be beneficial to see under what conditions bats and vanyls can share environmental similarities.
Second, if bats play a major role in human relations, how humans communicate with bats should be found.
Third, if a mammal acts as a real central unit, how it interacts with a variety of creatures that include humans, bats and lincinderins should be explained.
Finally, since many mammals as well as pets may be exposed to SARS-COV2, both care and access to research should be done.
If it may be a felin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-COV2 or its parent virus will almost be found in its natural environment in the future.
Continued research in this area will describe the way of the SARS-COV2 transition to animals, with significant effects on the prevention and control of the COVID-19 population.
A review of the diagnosis of those who are "convinced" and "pronounced" that they suffer from CoVID-19 is required.
By 6, February 2020, our team had printed a sample of the latest medical advice for the new coronavius treatment of 2019 (2019-nCOV), and this date provided our experience as well as the appropriate insurance to combat this global epidemic.
However, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) our new disease, our awareness and understanding increase based on continued research and medical experience; hence, the methods of testing and treatment are continually being ignored.
In this book, we have answered one comment about our professor and provided the question of the new findings of those who are "convinced" and "confirmed" that they are ill in harmony with Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for CoVID - 19 (seven edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus of 2019 had caused a revolution, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named a squature coronatry syndrome 2 (SARS-COV2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO referred to CoVID-19 as a plague.
In order to create the SARS-CoV2 fitting, our group has established a fast response screen and printed on the Internet in the Military Medical Research area in 06 February 2020.
She has received much attention since it was printed.
Notice, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, increased awareness and knowledge based on research and medical experience; therefore, the methods of diagnosis and treatment continue to be ignored.
The Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for CoVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http:/ww.nc.g.v.c.c.n/), between 16 January20 and March 2020, have published seven volumes when other things have been changed dramatically.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., presenting a simple statement of points based on their experience.
Their work added fresh proof of our path and made a significant reference to the plague earth wide.
We commend their vital work and express our thankfulness.
Their manufacturer, however, needs to be repaid in harmony with the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID - 19 (The seventh edition) and later research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to ensure a suspect illness requires a study of any one of the features of epidemiological history and two of the public displays to make a general analysis, or to meet three cases of postnatal therapy without clear records of epidemiological:
The history of Epidemiological: (1) the history of visiting or staying in the city of Ouhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with the SARS-COV2 (by a study of the unclic acids); (3) the history of contact with patients carrying a fever or signs of breathing in the city and environment, or other communities where they are reported to have been recorded in the first 14 days before 14 days; (2) the history of contact with many cases of those who are associated with patients in the school, as well as well as those who are at home, in school.
Medical symptoms: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) containing elements of the photo of COVID-19; (3) total number of white blood cells that show a normal, lower, or lower rate of lymphocytes.
A confirmed diagnosis of a specific illness should be based on a suspected disease that has one of the following evidences of the use of pogenic or serological: (1) a distorted PCR scan for real time for SARS-CV2; (2) a complete sequence of a virus gene that shows a high levels of the new coronavirus virus; (3) the loss of the IGM immune system as well as the IGSCO-SCOL; or the reserasteration of the recombination of the recombination of the human body, which has increased to the higher levels of the risk.
We see that the real timing of the PCR of the nucleus acid in the respiratory system or in the blood samples of the world in the second range (18 January 2020) and the third (2 January 2020).
The protogenic discovery of a blood sample is added in the four programs (27 January 2020) and 5 (8 February 2020); and serological evidence is included in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers in the study of the high - tech suncleic scans, as well as the samples of the respiratory system involving a blood sample, which increases the availability of different tissue, and contributed to the effect of the immune effect on a particular immune system.
Besides, there is more evidence to remind us to be on guard against patients who have unusual symptoms and who have no symptoms.
Thus, the Zou et al flow chart should be replaced, since it refers to a person who does not have any signs of treatment as a "low risk."
The process of argument also requires constant reassurance from the work and medical training.
In conclusion, we hope for further evidence to come and ask that the disciples observe it.
For a test of "the suspected illness" and "the confirmed illness", we recommend that new national selfs be followed and kept in their home.
Our bag will again return to offer our toilet for help.
The British reported five new deaths due to CoVID-19, the highest number of the day.
Last day, Bangladesh confirmed the five new deaths due to CoVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of the day caused by the virus.
Since yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, the Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the reported number of sick people is 114 and 33 righteous who sit at home.
The total number of 17 people who have died has been recorded.
In the Internet news service, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead include four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41-50.
Again he said that two were from Dorcas.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a disaster on March 11.
The hospital official told Anadou Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Coruption Commission, who was cared for by Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an Internet video declaration, President of the Bangladesh Road Transportation Obaidul Quader said that public transportation will be closed longer than that planned, until the next Saturday.
This closing of public transport had started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of important goods -- medical care, fuel and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded cases of CoVID-19 disease in Bangladesh were on March 8, with two of them from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three had already recovered.
The number of SARS-COV2 cases exceeds 1 million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-Corovrus cases exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths were associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by coronavirus.
This took place on the same day when Malawi confirmed her initial illness caused by coronavirus and Zambia had its first death related to coronavirus.
The North Korea has said, since Thursday, it is one of a few countries that do not have coronavirus disease.
Recently, the World Health Organization has compiled a report of 1,051,635 confirmed cases, which include 79,332 cases before 10 a.m. in Central European Europe (0000 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand coronavirus cases have been recorded, related to about 5,90 000 deaths.
The CBS News reported, quotes the Johns Hopkins University satellite, that more than 1,000 deaths have occurred in the US on Wednesday caused by coronavirus.
Around the world, the nations have declared strong measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyen, a Moscow city, signed the city’s invasion until May 1.
Throughout the world, President Vladimir Putin has declared that the Russians will continue to be paid without a job until April 30.
Portugal's parliament has voted to extend the national emergency within 15 days; the vote is awarded 27 15 votes, 10 votes, and one had an opposing vote.
Saudi Arabia is the time to return to the home of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day; before, the time to go home was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to use the time of returning home between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike De Winrie, has declared that the province has interpreted its law to stay at home until May 1.
Australia’s stores reduce the rate of buying small household paper from each purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian shopping network WOlaorths and Coles has reduced its sale of toilet paper so that one can buy two and one pack in each shop throughout the country.
THE ALDI then introduces the end of a single pack, on Monday.
These limits are cast as messages on exits, and on the Facebook pages of this store.
Buyers would continue to buy their large quantities because of the fear of COVID-19 if they were required to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woláorths again conceives the sale of toilet paper to those who are brought home to be one at each order.
These changes follow the front lines of the four-planes on each purchase issued by Wowoliorths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, on its March 8, newscast, reported that by the end of four-pointed boats, "most stores are still running out after an hour of their delivery"", and called the need "fifier"", while the ALDI, on its Facebook station on Tuesday, said "unexpected."
"Auction" has increased more" last week, according to the Wowoliorths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also decides the number allowed to be two boats a week ago.
To deal with the loss of sleep, Coles is the largest pegs to the surgeons and announced the increase in transmission, WOlaorths order is increased, while the ALDI make the stuff of a model prepared by Wednesday to be made fast.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that the salesmen try to increase the purchase, but the local council's limits on the time of truck delivery make things difficult.
He expects the production costs to increase, as the surgeons try to meet the need, with a few subscriptions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that as a result of the early release of the shop, some stores could not continue with the Third Chairperson.
In a report of News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a merchant of Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are filling a store every night.
He noted that the paper of a small house is a heavy item, which leads to a lower number of purchases in terms of numbers, and, when finished, it leaves a large space open, strengthening the feeling that it is worshiping.
Coles and Woláorths have an opinion [that] if there were many items in the shelves, if the product like the housepaper and the filler may be [soldiers] and there is an abundance, you can probably reduce anxiety by saying, Russell Zimmerman according to AB News.
The private paper producer Who Gives a Crap said that on Wednesday they are out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex Toilet Tisue, and Solaris Paper that makes Sorbent, emphasized that they work 24/7 to keep the product available, according to the report in News.com.
Domain.com, a real - estate Web site, reports that some real - estate vendors offer free paper to the first person in Melbourne Action, while few updates are being made because consumers have time to relax because of the long Labour Day weekends.
A Thursday translation of the NT News, an Darwin daily printing newspaper, added a six - page insert intended to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Stores were at first reluctant to set limits, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, when they said they had no plans to bring up the prices.
Russell Zimmerman added that some products also have a high demand, including cookies, potatoes, dried foods, laundry, and flour.
Similarly, except Australia, on Sunday night the supermarket that sells to the British Internet Ocado was seen to conceive of the purchase of Anders' private paper so that they could be two on a 12- carrot.
The World Health Organization calls the COVID-19 epidemic
On the third day, the World Health Organization (WHO) called a continuous disorder of COVID-19 — a disorder caused by the cornavirus SARS-COV2 — epidemic.
"While the term "multiple" refers to the degree to which the disease is spread, not to the extent in which specific examples are dangerous, WHO has shown concern for the need to run governments in action:
All countries are still able to reverse the plague.
If the nations search, investigate, here are, divide, follow and respond by controlling people’s emotions, says Tedros Adanom Ghebreesus, WHO Director-consoles.
We are deeply concerned about both the alarming and the alarming increase in numbers as well as the lack of terrify impulses.
"According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the epidemic "" has no earlier comparison."
"He said, by the sign announced to the CNN by February, "except the flu, no other respiratory infection has been followed from there to the spread of the whole world."
"Ghebreyas has shown the same vision, "We have never seen a plague removed from a coronavirus."
"It's continued, "and" askize was before we see a plague that can be controlled at the same time."
The new state of plague follows WHO's January decision to call zero as a global concern for public health emergency.
"The director of the United States's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said by chance, "What remains, will be worse."
Since Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126 000 examples of CoVID-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
The 20th plague is a continual epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by arsperate syndrome 2 (SARS-COV2).
The outbreaks were launched at Wuhan, China, in December 2019, were announced as the Public Health Emergency in All the World, on January 30, 2020, and were considered a disaster by 11 March 2020.
Since 10, April 2020, 1.61 million accurate examples of CoVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and borders, leading to 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 persons are calm.
The number of examples of extinctions has been estimated to be 4% in China, at the same time, of the globe from 13.04% in Algeria to 9.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include heat, cough, and loss of air.
The problems may include pneumonia and an acetamy syndrome.
The period of exposure to symptoms usually takes five days, but it can be from two to fourteen days.
There is no known cure or treatment that can defeat the virus.
Prescription measures include handwashing, breastfeeding, keeping distance between yourself and others, and keeping watch over and withdrawing from people who suspect that they are at risk.
Authorities around the world have responded by setting limits on travel, separation, travel, emergency measures at the workplace, and the closing of facilities.
This epidemic has led to serious economic and social upheavals worldwide, a shift in the number of sports, religion, politics, and cultural events, as well as a lack of material necessities that can easily be eliminated.
Schools include restricted international or international in 193 countries, which affects 99.4 percent of the world's students.
A mistaken knowledge of the virus has spread over the Internet, and conditions have also resulted in racial and ethnic discrimination against China, other people from East and Eastern ethnic and cultural background, and some from large Asian countries, with many other isolated individuals whose examples are of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in travel rates and the closing of major industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions.
Health authorities in Wunhan, China (the capital of Hubei region) reported a series of examples of a non-orthomonic causes that are unknown in December 2019, and a survey was opened at the beginning of January 2020.
Many examples have been associated with Huanaan Seafood Wholesalle Market and so the virus is usually caused by the origin of the disease from the animal.
The virus that caused the outbreak was known as SARS-COV2, the virus that first developed is closely related to the host coronaviruses, the conronoviruses of the conivin, and the SARS-COV. The first known person who showed symptoms was later diagnosed that he began to become ill in 1 December 2019, and that person had never had a clear contact with the tetmarket network.
In the first group of examples reported in December 2019, three parts were found to connect to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unprovable report from the South China Morning Post recommended that the following example from 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old Hubei province, may be the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported, as new examples are reported in China but growing rapidly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new examples outside China and then passed out of China's first example.
There may be reports under the example, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, small examples were reported among youths, those 19 and under building 2.4% of the world's examples. The chief science consultant of the United Kingdom's, Patrick Ballance, imitating 60% of the British community will need to be admitted so that the limit line will be reached.
Examples refer to the number of people tested for CoVID-19, and their examination to ensure the accuracy in accordance with the legal procedure.
Since 23 March, no country has examined more than 3% of its population, and most countries had laws against the testing of those with minor symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published in 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, 86% of the COVID-19 participants had not yet been found, and this unwritten link is the source of 79% of the recorded cases of disease.
A survey of statistics published in March 30 estimated that the number of fittings in Italy is much higher than the examples reported.
The initial estimate of a simple birth count ($0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.4.
Research published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that it may be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who are not healed, the time from the onset of the symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, which are most common to 14 days.
Since 10, April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths were imposed as the cause of COVID-19.
In China, since 5 February, about 80% of the dead have become more than 60, and 75% already have health problems that include heart disease and diabetes. Official death statistics with the COVID-19 epidemic generally refer to people who have died under examination for COVD for the legal process.
The true number of dead deaths of CoVID-19 may be very large, as not to include everyone who dies without checking the sub-sib. at home, in the home of the elders, etc.
Part of Italy found that the death toll during the epidemic exceeds the official death count due to CoVID in 4-5x.
"A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that [the death toll] is less than equal to "", a statement related to the reports of anecdotal calculates under the U.S.
The first death that took place outside China itself occurred in 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death that took place outside Asia took place in France in 14 February.
In 28 February, outside China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and areas had reported death, in all continents except Antarctica. There are several measures usually used to calculate death rates.
These numbers vary from place to place, and they are influenced by the extent of testing, the quality of medical care, the type of treatment, time since the onset of puberty, and social features such as age, sex, and general health. Adeath-to-casse ratio shows the number of the dead and divide them by a number of examples checked during a certain era.
Based on Johns Hopkins University' figures, the velvel death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) since 10 April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, death-to-case ratio estimates drop from 17.3% (for those with symptoms ranging from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms released in 1 February 2020). Some measures include the case case factor ratio (CFR), which shows a percentage of deaths due to disease, and infate condition (IFR), which shows the percentage of participants (intured and surveyed) who die from disease).
These figures do not depend on time and are following the number of individuals from the introduction of a model resolution.
Many scholars have tried to calculate these numbers of individuals.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the total fatality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
A higher estimate of this rate is in keeping with the results from an informal study of CoVID-19 in Germany, and a study of statistics that analyze the results of a test estimated by CFR.
WHO asserts that the epidemic can be controlled.
The true distance and length of a jump are uncertain and may vary from place to place.
"Maciej Boni of the Penn State University said, "If left unchecked, the resulting outbreaks break down the creature and begin to shrink when the disease dies of the bankers that we can find."
"But it is almost impossible to make accurate guessing right now as to when that will be."
"The Chinese chief public health adviser Zong Nanshan said that "It may be that it's probably finished by June" if all countries can make an incentive to follow WHO’s precautions to prevent the spread of the virus."
"At 17 March, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine spoke that SARS-COV2 "will go round, with force for one or two years."
“ According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be required "until the solution is obtained (by washing 18 months or more)."
" William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is impossible that this coronavirus (1) will disappear permanently" may also be "the annual disease, which has returned every year."
The cycle of returning will depend on the strong protection of the flock and the rate of change
The symptoms of CoVID-19 may be inaccurate in some areas and persons involved may not have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms of heat (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, the development of saliva and gums in the chest (phlegm), loss of breath, loss of breath, muscle and joint pain, pain of the neck, headache, cold, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, orcynosis. WHO has said that one person in six is seriously ill and has respiratory trouble.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list that shows signs of an emergency such as difficulty in breathing, persistent pain in the chest or depression, discomfort in the back, difficulty in waking, and poor face or lips; immediate medical attention is encouraged if these symptoms are present. The progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, a related form of pneumonia syndrome, veneississ, and death.
Some of those involved may not have symptoms, without medical symptoms, but their findings confirm the admission, so researchers have already given advice that those who had close contact with those who are confirmed must be kept close by and swallowed to ensure the absence of the disease.
China's estimate for those who do not have the symptoms is from a few to 44%.
The average temperature (between the period between the onset and the onset of symptoms) has range from 1 to 14 days; usually it is five days. For example, to measure the percentage of people with COVID-19 who lost their first sense of smell was 30% and then 15%.
Some details of the spread of disease are still being discussed.
The disease is believed to spread primarily during close contact with small joints formed when coughing, coughing, or speaking; when a close contact is about 1 to 2 feet (1 to 3 to 6 m).
Research has shown that unprehensible coughing can lead the joints to a distance of up to 20 feet [4.5 m] (15 meters) to about 30 feet [8.2 m].2 feet (2.7 m).
Some suggest that the virus may be transmitted by tiny particles that remain in the air for longer periods of time, they may also be present during conversation. The respiratory tract may also be formed during release of air, including when you speak, although the virus usually does not move through air.
Contestants can sit in nearby chimpanzees or in the noses of people or in case they can be tied in to the lungs.
Some treatments such as intactivation and cardiopulmonary resunation (CPR) may cause breathing loss of breathing to contract and result in loss of air.
It may also spread when someone touches an infected area, which includes the skin, and then touches the eyes, the nose, or the mouth.
Or there is concern that it may spread slowly, believing that the danger is low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of an outbreak of the SARS-COV2 virus by touching the mouth after contact with sewage. The virus has the risk of significant contact during the first three days when the symptoms appear even though spread may occur before the onset of symptoms and the final stages of disease.
Tests were found to be infected up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission might occur before important symptoms develop.
Only a few of the reports for examples that do not have the confirmed signs of the moth show, but the exchange without signals has been verified by other countries during the search for contact follow - up.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that while it is not clear how easily disease spreads, one person often affects two or three others. The virus continues to live longer than the other.
Pointedly, the virus is found up to three days in plastics (polypropylene) and 304 in stairwells sel, one day on board boards, and a button up to four hours of copper.
This, however, differs from the temperature and temperature range. Domestic animals and other animals have actually been found with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit a virus to humans, even though British fur orders man to wash his hands after touching animals, as is the case after touching areas that people with the virus may have infected themselves.
The Severe apotry syndrome 2 (SARS-COV2) is a new virus, which began to be isolated from three people who had pneumonia combined with a series of respiratory symptoms in Wuhan.
All the symptoms of the new SARS-CoV2 virus occur in a natural manner related to coronaviruses. Without the human body, the virus dies with home contact, as it melts its outer defenses. SARS-COV2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It was caused by the origin of the exchange from the animal kingdom.
Genetic research has revealed that coronavirus is somehow linked to the Betaconavirus form, the subtypes of Sarcecovirus (lineage B) and two tiny bats.
It is the same 96% in all the levels of samples of other bats. (BatCov RATG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that amino acid is a different component of the immune system between individual and man.
All the fittings to this day have found that it would be up to 92% of the very elements between the connovirus and SARS-COV2, which are not enough to prove that the vanalins are not the middle-keepers.
The spread of the virus may be obtained by detecting symptoms, even though confirmation is eventually due to converting the transcration test disciplineaction (rTRT-PCR) of transfer or CT image.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wun has raised that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although its appearance is lower, since many of its group images of other pneumonia and diseases.
"Since March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "CT" should not be used to investigate or become the first test process of COVID-19".
WHO has published the RNA code for SARS-COV2 checks, the first released in 17 January.
The test uses an ellipse transfer mode mode (rTRT-PCR).
Tests can be done through breathing samples or through blood.
The results are often seen in a period of a few hours in the days.
The test is usually performed by nesopharyngel sab although the vocal cords are also not used. The number of moths and companies improve natural activity, which enables access to antibodies.
Since 6, April 2020, not one of these has come to the fore as fully sufficient to be authorized to be used everywhere.
US a natural test via Cellex has been authorized to be used on emergency conditions only by licensed licensed documents.
The features of the image of attributes in the radar and the compact tomographical (CT) of people who display symptoms include a symmetry peripheral glass visualizations and an empty stream of software.
The Italian Radioological Society compiles the international database to be obtained with a verified model image.
Because of exposure to other diseases such as adenovirus, taking pictures without the PCR ensures that there is a limit to the exercise of COVID-19.
A major research in China compares the effects of CT and PCR’s chest effects and showed that while the image has a small degree of exposure, it is extremely sensitive and sensitive, which raises the idea of testing in areas of the epidemic.
Based on mathematical intellences, the protocols that are based on the vector-intellences have been developed so that they can detect the characteristics of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
Germs to protect one another from infection include maintaining total personal hygiene, washing one’s hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing using paper and placing a clean paper directly in the trash.
Those who may already have gained an advantage are encouraged to wear a mask in the community.
The steps of physical isolation are also encouraged to protect communication.
Yet, the virus has already reached the proportions of widespread population distribution in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is still spreading between communities, and some public members do not know where or how they are exposed. Medical personnel who take care of someone who may have been involved are encouraged to use a set method of caution, monitoring, and protecting the eyes. To follow the infected way to the health authorities to see the source of continued communication.
Using a local landmark from the cell for this purpose has removed anxiety about privacy, Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations are producing a state that imposes restrictions on this method of view.
There are already several automated or specially equipped to be used, and since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen professional groups have worked with concurrent resolutions, such as using Bluetooth to insert a log of a user's attachment to other khal-computers.
Users can now get the message when it happens to be close to someone who has been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. There are all-rescuitive theories about ways to prevent exposure; for example, cleaning the nose and mouthush are not effective.
There is no solution to CoVID-19, although most organizations work to build it.
Hand washing is encouraged to protect the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least two seconds, especially when you leave the bathroom or the kidneys look dirty; before the meal; and after the contraction, coughing, or urination.
The reason for this is that besides the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, since it explodes its protective balloon.
The CDC also recommended the use of a hand sanitizer based on alcohol based on at least 60% of the alcohol for volume if soap and water are not available at the time.
WHO urges people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Areas can be detected by a few resolutions (between a single minute of exposure that kills us bacteria instead of metainles sel), including 62–71% of ethanol, 50–100% of sopropanol, 0.1% of the sodium hypoclorite, 0.5% of hydrogen perroide, and 0.5% of polyvido-diine.
Other solutions, such as bocalkonium chloride and chrohexide gluconate, work to a low degree.
The CDC recommends that if the COVID model is criticized or confirmed in an area such as office or day care, all such places as offices, toilets, familiar places, equipment that are used by all people as satellites, screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM devices, must be killed by germs.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a elbow or nose when coughing, or sneeze, and quickly discard any discharge immediately.
The surgical masks are subjected to those who may be in contact, since wearing a mask sets the limit to the amount and distance of breathing droplets that flow from your talk, sneeze, and cough.
WHO has provided guidelines on when and how to use maski.
“ According to Stephen Griffin, a vilogist at the University of Leeds, "Putting on a mask may reduce [to] the tendency of people to touch the face, which is the main source of exposure without proper physical hygiene. "Mamaski is also encouraged to be used by those who care for someone who may be ill."
WHO recommends that healthy people can wear a mask only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although they also agree that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to promote the use of masks.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a cloth mask instead of using health care. China has specifically recommended that non-lying public members use discarded health checks, especially when you are closer to one another by (1) meter (3 ft) or below) and other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a mask when taking public transportation or sitting in crowded areas.
Health workers in Thailand's encourage people to make masks at home and to clean them regularly.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia officially banned entry into the community without wearing a mask or wearing a nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when going to public places to protect himself and others.
The Austrian government insisted that everyone entering the food store should wear an face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a skeletal mask when in the community.
Taiwan, as it has been producing ten million masks a day since the middle of March, has asked trains and city bus passengers to wear facial masks in April 1.
Panama has forced you to wear an face mask whenever you go out, at the same time encouraging building your own face masks to those who cannot afford your facial masks.
The mask masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Particular isolation (also known as physical isolation) includes steps to control the relationship that is intended to reduce the spread of disease by reducing close contact with people.
Roads include division; travel limits; and borders of schools, workplaces, stadiums, addresses, and shopping centers.
Individuals may be able to use social isolation methods by staying at home, by concluding visits, by avoiding crowded places, by greeting without contact, and by separating themselves physically from others.
Many governments are now pressuring or promoting social eclipses in those areas that have been ravaged.
The high number of gatherings raised by the US branches and health organizations was quickly reduced to 150 persons (if there was no spread of COVID-19 in the area) was placed at 50 people, and later reached 10.
On March 22,20, Germany officially banned a social gathering of more than two people. Older adults and those with health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, respiratory disease, and invading antibodies are exposed to the risk of serious illness and the CDC warns them to stay at home as much as possible in the affected public areas. At the conclusion of March 2020, WHO and other health conditions began to use the term 's physical isolation' so as to make it clear, to reduce the physical contact at the same time.
"Working the phrase "Separating" and leading to the conclusion that people must fully share in separation by staying, may encourage them to keep in contact with others in different ways. Some authorities provide guidelines for sexual health that are not used while the epidemic continues.
These include sexual urges only for a roommate, who is not infected with the virus or the symptoms of the virus.
The separation from home is what has been encouraged by those who have been diagnosed with CoVId-19 and who suspect that they may be involved.
The Ministry of Health has issued detailed regulations about the proper separation of oneself from home, and many governments have imposed restrictions on anyone who lives in the affected areas.
The most heavy housekeeping guidelines have been passed easily by those in high - risk groups.
Those who may be exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited the country or to a more frequently frequently have been encouraged to shut up 14 days from the time of possible final exposure.
Plans to control the epidemic are closing or suppressing, and reducing.
Immune operations are followed in the first phase of the epidemic and are intended to search for those who are involved and to introduce other programs to control the participation and medicines to prevent the spread of disease and to other people.
If the spread of disease is not possible, efforts are being made to reduce the spread of the disease: measures taken to reduce the spread and reduce the effects of health and community care.
Both imprisonments and reductions may be followed at once.
Pressure requires very strong measures to reduce the epidemic by reducing the relatively simple number of births to below 1. The part of caring for the outbreaks of infectious disease to try to reduce the phase of the plague, known as the severity of the plague.
This reduces the risk that health services are found to be frustrating and allows more time for medicines and solutions to be built.
Nonverbal interventions that can control the eruption include self - defense measures, such as personal hygiene, wearing masks, closing, blocking, social measures designed to keep off schools and attract public assembly events; sharing in encouraging the community to accept and participate in such interventions of such; and so on with the most unlikely measures such as cleaning areas. The more extreme measures of blocking the eruptions were taken in China when the size of revealed noise, such as total closing of cities, and closing the rules of the law.
Other countries have also taken different measures aimed at restricting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced the public view and created a regional ban, and it gave warnings about the movement of those involved.
Singapore has operated a financial support system for those concerned and has imposed a higher salary on those who have failed to do so regularly.
Taiwan has increased the production of the masks and has sentenced the use of medical goods. A reflection of the situation in Great Britain and the United States shows that reducing (supposing but not stop the epidemic) and that pressure (resisting the spread of the epidemic) has great challenges.
Basic cuts may reduce the pressing need for health care by 2/3 and half deaths, yet the end has been the death of hundreds of thousands and frustration of health programs.
The pressure may be better but needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to surround human society (or until the solution is found, if that comes first), as the exchange jumps quickly when the steps are released.
Long - term intervention to put an end to the scourge of crime brings cost both to society and to the economy.
There are no drugs specifically authorized to fight CoVID-19, but efforts to build them are on the way, including testing the already available drugs.
Taking drugs available at stores, drinking liquids, and rest can help soothe the symptoms.
Depending on him for difficulty, breathing therapy, injectory fluid, and support of breathing may be needed.

There are differing views as to where the first example (called the egg patient) came from.
The first known example of a new coronavirus returns to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In about a month, the number of examples of coronavirus in Hubei was slightly higher.
These have been closely connected with Huanan Seawood Wholeod Market, which once again sold animals, and the opinion that the virus came from another kind of animal; or, in other words, it has the origin of being taken from an animal. The insect’s unknown population was considered in December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhan XingJian in Hubei Provcial Hospital Hospital, who reported on the Whan Jianghan CDC in December 7.
"At 30 December, a team of physicians at the Wunhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues against "connavirus such as SARS".
The two doctors, including Li Wenliang, were admonished by the police to spread wrong gossip, and another, Ai Fen, was rebuked by his officers for sounding a warning.
The Ouhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice in December 31 and reported to WHO.
A sufficient example of unknown pneumonia was reported by the health authorities at Wunhan to remove research at the beginning of January. In the first stages of the attack, the number of examples was repeated at least seven and a half days later.
Early and between January 2020, the virus spread to other regions of China, being helped to move because of the New Year in China and that the Wunhan is a vehicle for transport and the exchange of major railways.
On January 20, China reported about 1,400 examples in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.

Since 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or 90% of the people, are under some type of sub-soil in the United States, more than 50 million people are under the cover of land in the Philippines, at least 59 million people are under the floor of South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are under the floor of India.

The flight accounts were also affected and thus changed. South Korea has come to be viewed as a large and elaborate system in the world for people to see if there is no virus, and then anyone who has been infected is followed and arrested by those involved.
The methods of viewing include the call to yourself when you have symptoms from outside countries by using khal-kal-klephones, by checking the virus when the results are available the next day, and by increasing the ability to detect the tests that will permit 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korea program is considered a success program in controlling the epidemic even though it is not entirely closed to cities. South Korea's community was divided in view at the beginning when President Moon Jae-in responded to the problem.

The testing of repiratry coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 and the SARS-CoV2 virus includes the means of detecting the presence of the virus and those which see the antibodies as a result when one is exposed.
The existence ofvises in the samps is confirmed by RT-PCR which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
A study is designed to evaluate the RNA of SARS-Cov2 virrus.
It is used to confirm the recent or surviving diagnosis of a disease.
Antibodies research, Serology, can be used both for personal examinations of a disease or for the employment of a host.
A study of antibodys shows how many people have contracted disease as well as those whose symptoms were too small to be diagnosed or without any symptoms at all.
The exact number of people dying from this disease as well as the imprecise rate in society can be achieved by the outcome of the test.
Because of the estimated number of tests, by the time of March 2020, no countries had statistics that can be trusted as to the number of viruses spread in their society.
By 23 March, no country had examined more than 3 % of the people in their countries and there is a significant difference in the number of statistics that have been done in various lands.
These differences may have a profound effect on reported death rates that may have exceeded some countries.
With the use of a real-time communication channel and communication timepiece, the rrt-PCR, this test can be done on various scanners, including nasophary sab or sputum supple.
The results are usually found between two hours and 2 days.
A study called RT-PCR by throat sabb can only be trusted in the first church for infection.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continues to increase in the lungs.
For infected persons tested for the second week, some samplearial can be removed from the depth of the oxygen channels by means of the urinateter or by coughing the matrix, sputum, can be used.
Some of the first PCR tests were developed in Charite in Berlin in January 2020 by the real-time communication communication communication channel was used by the transmeral communications test show inaction, the rrT-PCR, which makes the basis for the circulation of 250,000 units by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a method of testing on 23 January 2020. South Korea's Kogenebiotech company improved the PCR-based SARSCOV2 study of the quality of a clinic by 28 January 2020.
"Egene" is the same for all the beta coronaviruses and RdRRgengengengengene available only in SARS-Cov2. China, BGIGop was one of the most important companies who got the approval of the hard times the National Projects Administration of China to use the PCR-based SARSCOV2. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, The CD-200-200, The Noc, Rival-19, Rol-Divation, Rol-ECCCCC, which has been adopted by the National Administration of the World's Department of Social Development.
Three of the gene test systems in the old ways of the scans produced the subtle effects of the reagerants and the slow inspections at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in a rate of less than 100 samples a day that was successful throughout February 2020.
The surveys used in two sections were not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020 and up until that time when state and geographic checks were allowed to begin.
This method of testing was authorized by Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authority. Private check stations began to check early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, the Lab Corp announced international access to a national analysis based on RT-PCR
The Queen Diagnostics likewise made a test of COVID-19 obtained from 9 March 2020.
No mathematical estimate was announced, the collection and division of specimens should be done according to the CDC requirements.
In Russia, a survey of COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
On 11 February 2020 this method of testing was registered by the Federal Service Service for Survival in Health. In 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a form of testing for COVID-19. In 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnotics obtained a FDA test license that can be done within 3.5 hours.5 thus allow one machine to perform a test in its 24-hour.
In 19 March 2020, FDA has issued the Abbot Laboratorys license for critical times, EUA, to investigate by Abott m2,000, FDA had given the Hojogigic, Lap Corp and Thermo Fisher Scientific same authorization.
By 21-March 2020, Ceped has likewise acquired EUA by a FDA for a method of testing that lasts about 45 minutes.
FDA has agreed to a method of testing which uses the system's nucleic marry-amplification technology instead of the PCR.
Because this does not require a series of cold and heat cycles, this type may provide the effect of the postport in five minutes and the negative within 13 minutes.
Currently there are an estimated 185,000 units in the U.S. and Abbot expected to increase its production to be done for 50,000 studies a day. The study using mononoclobactol antibody specifically adheres to the nucleusocapsid protinin, N protin, the silent coronavirus, is developed in Taiwan in hopes that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes such as influe.
"The revision of the version of March 2020 concluded that "Budiographs" do not help so much in the initial stages but that CT, computer tomographical, may exist before the symptoms of the disease begin to appear."
The normal CT factors include the metateral voltargular glincher-glass-pathicities, symmetrical polymerial disorder.
Subpetul dominance, crazy tend and consolation increase as the disease changes itself.
A survey comparing PCR with CT a Wuhan in the area where the epidemic started suggests that CT is more sensitive than PCR but has no details , many of which are related to other pneumonia and disease procedures.
"According to March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "" CT can be used to sort or evaluate the COVID-19 first"" according to March 2020, the CDC encourages the PCR at first die"
Part of theimmupose resse in the treatment of disease is the production of antibodies, including Igm and GG.
These can be used to test the presence of disease from 7 days or longer to begin with symptoms of disease, to indicate public indiscretion and employment. Asseys can be made of major laboratorys, CLTs, or post-opin-opin-orare schemes, PICT.
The high rate of automated systems at many medical checkpoints will be capable of operating by asseys, but their availability will depend on speed and production of each one.
With CLT, only the peripheral blood is used normally, although specimen must be used for immune reactions.
With the PoCT, a single blood specimen is usually obtained by joining the skin.
In contrast with the PCR modes, the jump action is not necessary before esssay. By 26 March 2020, the FDA introduces the 29 letters that reported this Agency as necessary and are now able to distribute their antibody documents.
According to 7 April 2020, only one method of testing approved by FDA under the terms of emergency conditions. By the end of March 2020, Euroimiinium Medical Laboratorys and Embaltics obtained permission for their test scans from Europe to monitor the IgG and IgA antivirus antivirus antivis.
The amount of testing is a few hundred samps per hour so it is faster than the International PCR assay of the Viral RNA.
The presence of antibodies is often tested after 14 days of diagnosis. In April, the UK found that none of the antibodys who bought them could be effectively applied.
"E - Hong Kong has a program in which patients are suspected of being at home, "" of critical conditions that will give the patient specimen tube"", in order to reveal it, send it back and receive results in a short time. The British NHS has announced that it is beginning a search program to eliminate the threat that the patient will come to the hospital or the need to clean up the virus if available. Regarding those who are being diagnosed in the DCO-D for medical examinations, it is taking proper action.
Passing stations to help South Korea make a more rapid, more focused test in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statility Health Insurance Physicians spoke on 2 March, and said that they had a chance to include some 12,000 studies a day on the initiative and a survey of 10,700 had been made during the previous week.
The cost comes in the form of health insurance when a medical examination is called by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the power to include 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19 a driving test has been given in many major cities.
Since 26 March 2020 the total number of surveys produced by Germany had not been known, for only the true results were reported.
"The first survey of the project showed that from a week of 12/2020 calendar, the total total of at least 483,295 samples were examined until it arrived and included a scan 12/2020 plus 33.49%) in the survey confirmed SARS-CoV2. Israel, his researchers in Technion and Rampal and Rampal, and checked the method of testing for the results of the patient's studies, only at the same time as it was made to ensure that there were more than 2000 copies of the "Embhore" (U.8000).
Since the building has been undertaken by BI founder WI Yian and lasted 5 days, the model shows that Hubei's examples would be higher by 47% and the appropriate cost of meeting imprisonment would be doubled if the ability to include the test was not met in time.
The Hue-Yan Rab is soon followed by the maps of Huo-Yan in Shenzin, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities throughout China.
From April 2020 the total distribution of the day has been a survey of 50,000 a day. The open source, the sophisticated drawings released by the Origami Asseys have been opened to enable it to evaluate the samples of many patients to 1212 in COVID19 to use only 93 asseys. These technical models can work in small laboratories without the need of drilling robots.
Since March, the lack and insufficient number of reagents has become the eccentric number of objects in the surveys between the EU and the UK and the US.
This has led some writers to examine the rules for the presentation of samples that include the heating of the samples at 98 ° C (5 ° F) for 5 minutes so that the RNA elements are being tested more closely. By March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emirates has now examined the number of its people who are added to look at Coronavirus per head than in any other country, and they are walking at a good foot to increase the rate of research to reach a greater part of the population.
"This has been a combination of the ability to combine power to drive, and to buy apopulation missmask from Group 42 and BGI (based from "Hio-Yan" "Ergentisation Laboratorys in China).
Built in 14 days, the moth is able to direct tens of thousands of tests by RT-PCR a day and the first in the world of this active level outside China.
Various research techniques for different members of the coronavirus are developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has chosen a German process of building boats that are sent to countries that have no economic resources to build themselves.
The German project was published in 17 January 2020; a system adopted by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not discovered until 28 January, delayed the U.S. China and the United States with the problems of testing the first outbreaks, and these countries and Australia were unable to build and remove enough locks to satisfy the need and encourage health professionals.
In contrast, experts say that the extensive availability of research in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The ability to include experiments, especially in private clubs, was developed over a period of many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the energy of tests as the best way to reduce the incidence of the COVID-19 epidemic. The high demand for screening due to the spread of the virus caused an explosion of hundreds of thousands of workers in U.S. b.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of its checkers.
"In the United States, tests checks are made from the CDC that were found "with errors") the government removed legal walls that had banned secret checks. Spain bought kitchens in China’s Shenzinen Bioety Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The company explained that faulty results may be due to judgment on the collecting of samples or the proper use of kitchens.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would get out of the kitchens the wrong results, and would put in their space different kitchens operated by Shenzen Bioeysy. 80% of the Czech Republic checkers that they bought in China produced the wrong results. Slovakia bought one million checkers in China found to be accurate.
"Prime Minister, Matovič, held that they should be condemned by being installed in Danube. Ateş Kara of Turkish Health Ministry said that Turkish surveying scans were found to have "great number of errors" and were not "used." The UK bought 5.5 million checks in China, but at the beginning of April 2020, announced that they were not used."
The surveys, followed by the arrests of those found to confirm and were followed by those persons who had had contact with individuals who indicated to check on SARS-COV2, the results are also to confirm.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vś, the first deaths of CoVID-19 in Italy, directed two cycles of a total survey of 3,400 people, at least ten days away.
At least half of the people who went to extremes when tested did not have symptoms, and all the examples found were locked up.
Since visits are closed, this eliminates a completely new mix.
By tracking the victims, uninhibited visits are closed, testing, and delays, the 20th epidemic of coronavirus in Singapore continues more slowly than other developed countries, but without such severe restrictions as the ban on food stores and other commercials.
Most of the events have been recorded, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at home by 28 March, but schools opened by time after vacation in 23 March.
Several countries have also been able to care for the epidemic with a series of calls, internal pregnancy, surveys, and imprisonments, but on a small scale in closing, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics have found that more studies, compared to the number of dead people, have lower rates of death, which may be due to a better approach for researching those who are poor or not at all.
WHO recommends that countries without the ability to include testing and the national clubs have limited experience with CoVID-19 and sent the first and then 10 reliable samples of CoVID-19 in one of the 16 labs in WHO to ensure a test.
Among the 16 reliable clubs, 7 from Asia, 5 from Europe, 2 from Africa, 1 is North America and 1 is Australia.
In the next chart, the column "Certificate % of checking" is influenced by the world's test mechanism.
A country that examines only hospital admissions will have many confirmations about % of a test country that examines all its citizens, whether or not, some things are the same.
Washing hands (or washing hands), also known as handwashing, the act of washing hands with the aim of removing unwanted dirt, glass, small items, or crafts.
Cleaning the hands with soap in those " dire times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which contribute to the oral procedure.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as colds or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, sensitive traits).
The five critical periods during the day when washing hands with soap are essential include: before and after the release, after washing the baby’s nails or changing the diapers, before and after feeding the baby, and after handling raw meat, fish, or domestic birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the child who used the toilet.
After contraction, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Physical cleanliness refers to sanitary practices associated with the medical practice.
Washing hands before administering medication or treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main purpose of the handwashing is to wash the hands of panogens (bacteria,viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is of great importance to people who carry food or work in the medical field, but it is an important process even in the general community.
Cleaning the hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; protecting the related causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory diseases;
and to reduce infant mortality rate at home.
A 2009 study showed that improved hand washing may lead to a lower rate of improvement during the age of five.
In developing countries, the mortality rate associated with respiratory infections and diarrhea can be reduced by embarking on a simple lifestyle change, such as handwashing with soap.
A simple action can reduce the mortality rate by about 50%.
Step - by - step interventions that promote soap washing may reduce the flow of the mud in three parts, and this can be compared to operating clean water in economically poor areas.
A drop in the chapters of 48% can be linked to the washing of hands with soap. Cleaning the hands with soap is a very efficient and inexpensive way to protect diarrhea and home, schools, and communities worldwide.
A pneumonia, a major ARI, takes the lead alone as the cause of infant deaths under five years of age, destroying an estimated 1.2 million children's health each year.
Both diarrhea and pneumonia contribute to about 3.5 million infant deaths a year.
According to UNICEF, changing hand washing before meals and after using the toilet to become a firm habit can save more health than any single cure or medical intervention, determine death for diarrhea about half the time.
Cleaning the hands is usually combined with other moving entrys as part of water, sewage and sanitation (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against pneumonia which transmits direct contact.
A minor accident as a result of constant washing of the hands is the damage to the skin caused by a dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing can result in the effect of the bite, and the form of skin with a disk known as the hand czema or card dermatitis, which is most common among health workers.
Cleaning the hands frequently is also seen as one of the obssive-communiculous disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when handwashing is important to reduce the transmission of the disease by oral procedure: after using the toilet (pervasion, release), after cleaning the baby's urine (turning the diapers), there is no need to feed the baby, before or before or after preparing or handling raw meat, fish, or birds.
Other times when proper handwashing should be followed to avoid transmission of the disease includes before and after handling damage or damage; after coughing, coughing, or contraction; after touching an animal’s nose or handling of animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low level of soap cleaning.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on an average, 38.7% of families follow the process of handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had a peak of 97 percent; the United States nearly 70 percent; and China at a low rate of 23 percent; and China is now under the rate of practices in raising it. A few practices are currently taking place to adopt the practice of hand washing at critical times.
The "Escentral Health Care Program" introduced by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the practice of child health and education.
Twice a year, corresponding with regular soap cleaning, daily fluoride is the center of the world's order.
It is also well established in Indonesia.
Removing microorganisms from the skin is better with soap or cleaning.
The main function of soap and cleaning is to reduce matters that interfere with the solution, and to increase the overallity.
Water alone is not enough to clean the skin because fats and proteins, earth’s structures, are not easily dehydrated.
But cleaning is helped by the water flowing to the point.
A popp, capable of renaling, may keep the virus out of action.
A small number of studies that monitor the transmission of a virus from a tumor that is infected conclude that it is impossible as the bacteria are cleaned and foam is cleaned.
The CDC still continues that "hydraulic soap and control without hands is better.
Antimicrobial gifts are widely advertised by members of a health - care society.
To this day, there is no evidence that using antisaptics or renuncients select natural antibiotics.
Antibacterial soaps, however, have regular antibacterial symbols such as trilosans, with a long list of faiths.
Thus, even if the antibiotic antibodies have not selected an antibacterial soap, they may be unable to function properly as they are sold.
Besides the surfactant, complex structures may contain acids (acectic acid, ascorbic acid, laccic acid) as a rule of pH, antimicrobily active betactic acid and other skin managers (aloe tara, avitins, dolphins, platts). An extensive analysis from the Universe of the Ministry of Healths showed that they work in the same way as analtics as aquator to remove bacteria.
The hot water with which you can wash your hands does not burn to the proper degree for bacteria to die.
Germs increase greatly when the temperature of the pond is about 37 degrees Fahrenheit [37 ° C].
However, warm, soap - containing water works better than cold water, which has a solution to the removal of natural fat that holds soil and bacteria.
In contrast, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not contribute to reducing microbial lead in the hands.
The hannitizer or sand antisaptic is a symbol of a clean hand-washesion of water.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, antipseptive handwashils (also known as alcohol-bendi-sand habs, antiptic pumps, or sanitizers) began to find prominence.
Many based on the sypropyl alcohol or the enlarged ethanol was combined with a hot index as Carbomer (polymer of acryic acid) make it a string, or a emuctant like glycerin into a liquid, or a foam to make it easy to use and reduce the form of alcohol.
Installing liquid hydrogen-perroxide raises an antimispherial function further. The hand sanitizer contains 60 to 95% effectively kill bacteria.
The alcohol thresholds kill germs, multi-drug bacteria (MRSA and VREA), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSVs, chlorovirus, vacinia, influenza, and hepatitis).
The 60% alcohol thresholds killed 99.97% (3.5 mg decreases, like 35 decibels in the hands of 30 seconds after anointing and 99.9% per cent per cent of bacteria in the hands of 1 minutes after the coughing. The hunicitizers work well on bacteria and they are less active in certain viruses.
An alcohol-based hanikizers are almost completely ineffective in norovirus (or naralk) type of bacteria, a major cause of intercomertic activity. A sufficient antipacttic or alcoholbu should be used to treat them completely or to treat both hands.
The front front of both hands and inside and fingers is rubbed about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or cell is dry.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention encourages washing of the hands rather than washing with sand sanitizers, which is particularly sensitive when it is clear that the hands are flat.
The rise in the use of these representatives is due to their simple action and ability to kill micro-organisms; but, however, they should be used to replace the proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
The regular use of a henizers based on alcohol can result in dry skin except when molecules and/or skin braces are inserted into a combination.
The process of alcohol - resistance alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by inserting glycerin and/or evolents in combination.
In a medical study, sanitizers based on alcohol-evolents make better and more dry skin loss than soap or antimicrobials.
Allergic contact dermatatis, constact Urtariaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or orderives that exist in alcohol syndrome are rare.
The low condition of causing the carritant contact dermatitis to be attractive compared to the washing of hands with soap and water.
Whatever their function, waterless agents cannot wash their hands from the elements, but they do kill only germs.
That is why the huntizens do not function properly as soap and water in preventing the spread of many protogens, as the protogens continue to be in the hands.
The effectiveness of non - alcohol - free hanitizers depends much more on ingredients and combinations, and according to history they work badly than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, the combination of bicolkonium chloride has shown the persistence and increase of the antimicrobial function, in contrast with alcohol, which has been shown to reduce the amount of work after repeated use, may be due to the continued response of the skin.
Many people in economically poor communities cannot buy soap and use ashes or soil in place.
The ashes or soil may work better than water, but it works less than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash are exposed to micro-organisms may raise the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ashes are also an antiviral representative because when combined with water, a mixture of calcium is produced.
WHO encourages ashes or sand instead of soap when soap is not available.
The proper handwashing process promoted by the US Centers for Disease Control for Prevention of Transmission of Disease includes these steps:
Let them wash their hands in warm or cold water.
Traveling water is encouraged because standing water may be contaminated, while the temperature of the show water makes a difference.
Wash your hands with proper soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under the nails.
Soap carries germs to the skin, and research shows that people often wash their hands thoroughly when soap is available instead of using only water.
Stop for at least 20 seconds.
Swimming produces heat, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and long - term vomiting removes more bacteria.
Clean yourself thoroughly under moving water.
Washing your hands may defile your hands
He drys them with clean mud or lets them dry up in the spirit.
Wet and wet hands easily take wastes. The easily forgotten areas are the thumbs, the scene, the middle parts of the fingers, and under the nails.
The intermolesh fittings can hold microorganisms.
A dry roach is often encouraged to keep the hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can raise exposure to disease.
Unwanted separate programs can be made to meet and clean hands when tap water and/or soap is not found. To supply water by pumping a vessel or a drum with suitable holes and/or using ashes if needed in developing countries. In limited water conditions (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are expensive methods for saving water, such as "tippy-taps" and other types of savings.
The tippy-tap is an easy technology to use a rope-laid drum, with a footrope that brings small water in the hands and a handle of the soap.
Practical drying of the hands is an important part of the process of handwashing, but there is a difference as to how best to dry in public baths.
A growing level of research suggests that paper tires are better for cleanliness than for airtimes found in cleaning facilities.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, which was sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of cleanliness obtained from paper tires, hot - and dry - backed hand workings.
After washing and drying the hands with hot air pressure, the total number of bacteria was found to rise at the level of fingers by 2004% and at hand lengths by 254%.
Refrigeration of the air pressure was effective in raising the total number of bacteria in the fingers by 42% and at 15% in the hands of the hand.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of the virus dropped by 76% and the handpits by coming to 77%. Scientists also took a study that could reveal if there was a chance of joining the cleaners and cleaning areas as a result of each dry process.
The quick - air muscle, which absorbs air from it at a set speed of 180 m/s (1650 km/h; 400 mph), has succeeded in pulling micro-organisms from the hand and hand and virtually inflating other users with a clean space of up to 40 feet [2 m].
The use of hot air has spread micro-organisms up to 200 feet [0.25 m] from the smoke.
The paper tires did not show the obvious sleep patterns of micro-organisms. In 2005, a study led by T
The following change in the number of microbes was observed:
There are many manual manufacturers available, and hand mills have been compared to setting up by plan towils.
Cleaning the hands with sanitings is another way on the trip of soap and water.
An alcohol-built hanitizer must have alcohol at least 60%.
Medical washing was forced long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis had acquired its function (1846) to protect the disease in the hospital area.
There are electrical outlets that operate with notes that remind hospital workers to wash their hands when they forget.
One study has seen a reduction in disease rates by its effectiveness.
Medical washing takes about 15 seconds, using a lot of soap and water or a cell to apply or rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed together by shaking hands.
If there is dirt under the nails, the brash can be used to remove it.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to clean up and clean up the standing water with a clean towel.
After the stopper, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if possible).
Do not do that again.
The purpose of washing hands in the care area is to remove the petogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid passing them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the slacking of hand washing continues to be unacceptable in many medical areas, a large number of doctors and nurses continue to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple techniques can reduce the level of the catheter-rated bloods in 65 percent. The World Health Organization has published a chart that shows the policy of hand washing and washing the hands in the field of health care.
Organizational guidelines for sanitation can be found on its cassettes for public recognition.
The appropriate replacement was directed by the Whitby et al.
Shopmates may be able to measure and ensure the cleanliness of the hands, if showing and complying with the rules is required.
The World Health Organization " has five times" to wash the hands:
after exposure to blood/blood fluid
prior to the development of the enterptic function, and
and after taking care of the patient. Injecting anti-retroviral chemicals (" or "microbes" gifts that give the power to kill in the washing of the hands.
Those lethal powers may be needed before the operational or in conditions where antibiotic-resistant organisms are most frequent. 'To pump one' for the purpose of the operation, it is necessary to have a pump that can be opened and closed without being handled by hand, chlorofrexide or iodine wassh, asterile towels to dry after the washing, and asterile brush in the washroom.
All jewelry should be cut off.
This procedure requires washing hands and arms up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
Longitudinal dives (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When approaching, the water in the arm should be kept from running back to hand.
After completing the washing of the hands, the hands are dried in a metal cloth or a surgical garment is worn.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is best to wash your hands or use a handbacter before and after treating a patient.
In order to control staphlocical diseases in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from clean hands is from the first 20% to clean up, and that too little is available for the extra benefit when repeated hand washing has been increased over 35%.
Raiding with empty soap results in a threefold increase in foodborne infection compared to cleaning hand-rubing with alcohol-baul - based alcohol solution and having wishing antibacterial contact for a 30-time period of secondary depression perached caused by the alcohol penp - ruberal reaction 26% of the bacteria.
But soap and water work better than alcohol-beled hand rubs in reducing H1 influenza Avirus and Clotridium difficile spores in hand. Interactivity can include teaching workers by washing their hands, raising the availability of alcohol-beled hab, and keeping a written and recommended reminder to the staff.
There is a need for further research that analyzes which of these approaches works best in different health - care situations.
In developing countries, soap washing is recognized as a safe means, an essential tool for achieving good health, even physical nutrition.
Yet, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or cleaning facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to reach the practice of washing the hands of the earth.
In many rural areas of Africa, for example, handwashs near private toilets or cans are scarcely needed, although there are inexpensive ways to build a house for washing the hands.
However, low - quality hand washing may be the cause of more deeply ingrained habits than that of a lack of soap or water.
Advertising and standing up to the act of washing hands with soap can contribute to the making of rules, fostering awareness of the benefits of washing hands and leading to change of living habits.
For this to work out well, caution and concentration are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that public - based methods work in raising the hands of LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One example of the advertising of the "Thurs" schools of UNICEF encouraging schools to take simple measures, protective to ensure that students clean their hands with soap, during other sanitary requirements.
When small amounts are reached, schools can move from one to another and eventually go to three stars.
The building of handwashing facilities can be part of a campaign that is designed to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Manual Cleansing Day is one of the examples of projects that promote caution in an effort to achieve a change of behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 epidemic coronavirus, UNICEF has declared the widespread use of handwashing.
A few studies have taken into consideration all the cost of handwashing in developing countries and social connections and the prevention of DALYs.
However, one return suggests that the sale of soap cleaning costs far more than other water and cleaning agents.
The importance of washing the hands of a person’s health – especially for people under such weak conditions as the amputees who recently brought them or the wounded soldiers to hospitals – was first protected during the 19th century by two hand - washing glasses: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English "the founder of modern nursery."
At that time many still believed that disease was caused by the terrible odors calledmias.
In the 1980 ’ s, outbreaks from food and medical - related illnesses led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more advertising as an important means of protecting the spread of disease.
The outbreak of the flu in 2009 and the plague of CoVID-19 in 2020 led to high precautions in many countries regarding the importance of handwashing with soap to protect oneself from this kind of infectious disease.
For example, the seats with the inscription "proper washing of hands" are hung up near the toilet sink in public toilets and toilets in German offices and airports.
The phrase "Clean your hands" in something, means to make clear to anyone not wanting to take responsibility for something or get involved in it.
Its origin is part of the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate, by washing his hands in the decision to scourge Jesus Christ, has become the most widely accepted expression in some English society.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Macbeth forces us first by washing our hands in an attempt to clean up the suspected uncleanness, which represents a guilty conscience regarding the crimes that she had committed and persuaded her husband to do.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or thinking about improper acts, often wash their hands more often than others, and they often appreciate the importance of washing the hands more often.
Moreover, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward they are less likely to share in ‘ cleaning up, ’ such as the surgery.
Religion encourages the washing of hands with both the purpose of hygiene and the model. A symbol in cleansing hands, using water but without soap to clean hands, is part of the process that exists in many religions, including Bahá’í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and th letilat laide in Judaism, Lavabo to Christianity, and Wudu to Islam. Religions also promote the washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam force the washing of hands after using a toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force the washing of hands before and after meals.
Sub-Programme Protocol Control
The risk control controls in the Department of CoVID-19 for the use of an application to control risk and health in preventing coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk management at the workplace depends on the position and nature of the work, on supporting the risk of exposed sources, the risk of disease in the community, and on the risk factors of individual workers which may have been weakened in preventing COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (WHO), low - risk activities have lower social contact with other employees, which say that simple protective measures are promoted, include washing their hands, fostering the staff to stay in the home when they are sick, breathing habits, and keeping cleaning and killing bacteria in the workplace.
The activities that can be exposed to the middle risk include those that seek to touch regularly and are close to strangers or suspected of having COVID-19, but they may be infected because of ongoing social contact or visits to foreign countries.
This includes employees who have social contacts such as schools, overworked people, and multimillionaires.
The risk control controls in this group, in addition to simple preventive measures, include the agencies that use the High-efficienty citizens, the sneenaze guards, and the presence of the perimicactive presence in conditions where a person with COVI-19 is found.
WHO considers health and cold workers exposed to well-known or suspected of having colic-19 as a higher risk of exposure, which leads to higher risk of exposure when workers make aerosol-generating procedures, or pick up or handle specimens from well-known or suspected people.
The safety regulations suitable for these workers include building control such as the entrancing pressure station, and the individual platforms which are suitable for the job.
the occurrence of *coVID-19 can have serious consequences within the workplace.
Workers may be out of work because of sickness, the need to care for others, or because they are afraid of being exposed.
The user’s habits may change, with both the necessary types of goods, and with the means of obtaining these goods (such as shopping in less - busy times or by delivery or driving tasks).
Finally, the transfer of items from the regions of COVID-19 may be interrupted. Preparation for the infection associated with the response program can be used to regulate protective actions.
Programs consider the risk factors involved in different workplaces and the nature of the work, including exposure, domestic or social hazards, and harmful occupational factors, such as high - level or chronic illness.
They also clarify the proper management to handle the risks, and the following programs of situations can rise as a result of an eruption.
Preparation for the illness and response programs may depend on the influence of national law or regional law.
The aims of responding to an emergency include reducing tension among employees, protecting people from serious health problems, keeping jobs in business, and reducing the adverse effects of some businesses and buyers.
The difficulty of disease in society is the business in which it affects response initiatives taken.
Risk control steps are the most widely used frames in the Occupational Safety and health to combine risk controls with results.
When the risks of CoVID-19 are not removed, the control that works best for building control is followed by the management of the control system, and the maintenance of personal safety.
Construction management involves separating workers from work - related accidents without trusting the work habit, and it can be a more expensive move when applied.
Retirement control control systems or procedures that require the action of an employee or an employer
Personal protein development (PPPE) is far more effective than the control of the building and management, but it can help to avoid exposure.
All PPE types must be selected on the basis of an employee risk, properly dressed as an appropriate (eg., erelets), worn regularly and in a manner that is checked, maintained, and converted, required, and cleaned up, and maintained or discarded from pollution.
According to the U.S. O. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (WHO), low-disrupted activities can have little effect on society and on other peer workers.
The simple steps to prevent infection in all workplaces include frequent and thorough washing of hands, urging workers to stay at home when they are sick, to breathe in good breathing habits that include coughing and sneezing, to prepare household chores or to serve, to encourage workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, and to keep up the process of cleaning and killing bacteria in the workplace.
Early detection and the isolation of potential infected people to protect employees, customers, watches, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with anxiety symptoms should stay at home until they can no longer heat, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of anti-retroviral drugs, and that the day rules of illness become flexible, allow the staff to stay at home to care for the sick family member, and that the staff know these rules.
According to OSHA, the affected activities include those activities that require regular contact or close contact with six units (1.8 m) with people who are not considered to be COVID-19 patients, they are infected with the SARS-COV2 virus due to ongoing friction in a community near the workplace, or for the reason that someone has recently returned from a foreign country that may be more likely to communicate with CoVID-19.
These include staffs that can interact with the general public as schools, high - pressure workplaces, and high - level commercial systems. Building control systems of these high - risk groups includes installing high - risk devices, promoting quality maintenance, maintaining avention level, restricting the amount of plug-ination, and providing a window to drive through the service system. Managing the management of this category of high - pressure jobs includes encouraging the staff to stay at home, building up a system of communications to get up space space spaced, social workers to get busy, social workers to get busy, social skills, and social workers to work, social skills, and social workers to improve skills, social skills, social skills, etc.
The workers in this exposed group do not usually need to use e - mails.
If a person starts to get sick in the plane, proper control systems for rebellion against personnel and other passengers include separating the sick person with a distance of 6 knots, putting one crew member to care for the sick, and providing a facial mask for the patient or asking the patient to cover his mouth and nose with a nose when he coughs or sneezes.
A snowflake should wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or affecting body sweats or places that may be unclean, and it may be that more protective equipment can be hot, persistent cough, and difficult to breathe.
Racings and other losses should be discarded with a biozard, and areas that have been discovered should be cleaned and contaminated later. In connection with the market's ships, including travel ships and other passenger transport vessels, the control of the can include delays of the journey when you are sick, and separate yourself from the treatment center as soon as someone starts to burn or other symptoms when he is on board.
If possible, medical tracking must be affected by a person who has divorced. In school areas and day care, the CDC encourages temporarily closing for the purpose of cleaning and killing bacteria if the infected person has ever been inside the school building without spreading.
If there is little to the middle of the community, the separating techniques may have been developed as a kick for thefield trip, the meetings, and other large gatherings such as natural education, boarding schools or diets, increasing the space between desks, arriving in half - hour and home - hour visits, overcoming unwanted visitors, and using the place of a different health center for children with coldlike symptoms.
When the virus spreads dramatically to the public, in spite of the efforts of social isolation, it may be considered closed schools. For law enforcement personnel who perform daily tasks, the risk of health at the time is viewed as low by the CDC.
Legal personnel who must contact people who are confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as those of emergency workers in health situations, as well as the proper safety equipment.
If there is a strong connection between the arrival of a person, the workers must clean up and clear their work belts and clothes before reuse them with a spray or house cleaning cloth, and follow routine procedures to prevent the spread of the virus and the removal of used PPPE and to keep and wash the clothes.
WHO estimates that some medical and cold workers are at greater or greater risk of exposure to disease.
The activities of those exposed to increased risk include those who send medical supplies, relief supplies, laboratorys, and medical personnel exposed to known patients or who are suspected of having COVID-19.
These become the most serious risk of exposure to disease when workers develop aerosol, or collect or handle samples, from well-known or suspected cases of having COVID-19.
The processes that produce aerosol include the inserting of ablue, bronchoscopies, methods and tests of teeth, or the gathering of the body’s samples.
The colds of exposure to the most dangerous disease include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people with known or suspected cases of having coVID-19 when they die; these become more dangerous when they examine the bodies. More automation control of these dangerous groups include private rooms for known or suspected cases of acoVId-19, including where the development of aerosol.
Special ventilation with high pressure may be necessary in some cases for treatment and for colds.
The samples should be handled by the safety guidelines of the Bisaatety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the arriving patients be divided into separate wards depending on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to another PEPE, OSSHA promotes esperators to those who work between 6 and well-known patients, or who are suspected of having the SARS-COV2 virus, and those who develop aerosol.
In the United States, N95 sharp facials approved by NIOSH or better must be used as a full - documented security system, which includes an examination of physical, exercise, and medical research.
Some types ofrepirators can be more protective and improve the quality of the worker. WHO does not encourage coveralls, since COVID-19 is a disease that enters not by body fluids.
WHO only encourages surgical scanners in the entrance areas.
For those who collect out - of-aerosol samples, care for, or transport patients without aerosol innovations, WHO encourages surgery, glasses, or faffe shower, gallon, andges.
When aerosol is introduced, N95 or FFP2 scanor replace surgery scans.
Because PPPE is not available enough in the world, WHO recommends reducing PPPE by telephone communications, actual prevention as window-showing windows, allowing only those directly involved to enter a hospital with COVID-19, use only PPPPE needed to do some work, continue to use the same reparator without removing it while caring for many patients with the same disease, exercise caution and control the use of PPE, and restricting the use of the presence of the presence of non - symptoms.

DAY/ LAST DAYS: 14 March, 2020, 00:00
BRANCH OFFICE: C0: No privileges specified
We find ourselves in a unique position during this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a factor that makes it clear how people in the world are connected with the load we have each other.
We have never experienced the same challenges, but we know that our reaction depends, not on the kind of sympathy we have experienced in the world, but on the workings of human compassion, cooperation, and community development that are at the root of this organization.
The cooperation and care we have seen in all our employees by e - mail, telephone, and chats is a remarkable guarantee that we have good people with whom we are privileged to work.
I am truly happy and proud of working with you.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
He reminded me of how logical it is for the earth to be able to open the Wikipedia right now, and this is a strong sign on this important source that it is always available on the Internet and is available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep open or our employees paid or because our communities are protected.
The world needs the information found in Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it, which will have a profound impact on the earth.
In view of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will have a profound effect on the way we deal with one another, starting with the issue that lies ahead.
Changes in our work with the chain
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the bat-c has met that evening and discussed how to work with our daughter of days and months to come.
In that discussion, we have considered what we felt would be a positive response to the situation and how best to keep the organization going during this time.
We can only expect to get rid of stress and support for our long - term goal.
If you have to drive it again, it is right.
For all employees, the loan companies, and the staff of the loan:
Our expected daily work will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until a change is announced.
We do not advertise vacations - if you can work extra hours, the company can use it.
However, things are uncertain in the world now, and whether you have to care for people you love, buy food, or go to a doctor, your health comes first.
We will not be following the crowd of his day.
If you are sick, don’t work.
We really do not need to say this, but we will.
You don't have to put down the days of sickness or PTO - you will simply tell your manager and help your boss to re-resolving calendars and checks to ensure that the main parts of the work are being accomplished.
( If it is found that you have the COVID-19 virus, please tell Bryan between the T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure that your condition is properly cared for by the authorities).
Workaholics will be paid in full.
We have already said so, and we would be depriving ourselves of fulfilling our obligations to our employer of the company and those who work hours.
Everyone will be rewarded according to his normal working hours.
This includes getting sick and being unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to bring their stress into line with the environment.
What we do can be a unique reward, especially in times like this.
Again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to talk to your supervisor, so that we can know what to expect and plan accordingly.
Another work is viewed as important.
There are things we must keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundrasing (between others) perform a crucial task that may require additional support.
We will start the process with all doors to check the current goals and move our focus to support what is important to our goal.
With so many things to do, we will simply focus on the more important products.
Slacking the speed now will not harm us later.
We do not sit in "to work more than once the epidemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work more hours to finish the job at a time that is especially unusual right now.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and times where necessary.
What happens to the APP (Annual Planing)?
To change our new circumstances and the hours of the work we expect every day, we intend to change the time of our 2020-21 Antwerp Plan.
Our aim is to suggest the adoption of our 20-20 schedule, which allows more time to permit the crew to do critical tasks first, to take care of themselves, and to care for their loved ones while assisting those who need or desire to work on the part of the next few weeks.
This review of the working age greatly reduces the current schedule and pressures on the entire organization.
We will introduce what we expect of Boaz next week and will review the representatives and steps that follow as soon as we have the assurance.
Thanks to the APRate Act for taking the lead in this.
Office condition, exposure, and sanitation
Last week, we read that one of our SF employees may be exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we sent a cleaning crew to remove bacteria from all parts of the San Francisco office.
Use antiretroviral soaps to remove germs everywhere, as well as in the reception area of visitors and in anesthesia that enters our area.
The building uses its maintenance protocol by using products that support the safety of its neighbors.
We feel comfortable knowing that the office will be more suitable when we decide to return.
Our DC office is in We Work, which has shared with us its COVID-19 protocol and with all the personnel on DC.
Since last week, our DC has moved to a remote area that has been fully occupied according to the guidance given by San Francisco.
As our fellow staff of the island knew, we had been talking about renting property in Brooklyn.
The discussions continue but may take some time.
Some of our employees work farther away for the first time.
Our longtime employees know that it can be a big change, and they want to give you advice:
Reduce the amount of meetings to at least one or two hours.
If long - term meetings are needed, give thought to how you can keep them separate within a number of days.
Make it clear that the meeting is about you, that you have an kaka, and send out items that should be read in advance.
Do so by video, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoos to work and connect to each other.
Have someone take the lead in organizing all the meetings, someone to look up questions at the meeting and follow up on the discussion, and someone to help write notes (or take notes together).
Send e-mail to your computer support team if you need a virtue tape.
Use your social money to purchase the price of a budget.
See #remoties to discuss your work with your siblings
An HROperations party requires guidance on Internet network in effective working methods to support the increase in the work being sent to the whole company.
In the previous week we invited all who received back in the community to report for public events sponsored by Wikimedia, such as Willons, WHO until it announced that the epidemic has ended.
We will tell them that we have understood that our application of credit and other restrictions can make it impossible to complete their corporate budgets and that no one will be repaid for delay or change those goals.
In this coming week we will follow another direction to Wikimania and other social services that are read and studied.
The general feeling of public in the world seems to be a nuisance but to be relieved by the interpretation and opportunities to concentrate on their communities, the Wikamedia, and so forth.
In time, CRT works to pick up a page from Meta-Wiki to give public space to watch the impact and follow our conversations with them.
Keeping connected on matters related to CoVID- 19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for the coming Thursday, at 14:00 TC/07:00 for the special meeting of the staff.
We will use this time to share some of your comments, answer your questions, and spend some time talking.
We work together and will help you wherever we are able.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information in this mail, including all the relevant COVID-19 relevant information, in the Office Wiki.
CRT will save these modified pages and all information in the same location.
We also work to maintain regular contact with the staff who live in the more affected countries at present.
If you have questions about walking, events, major work routes, the challenge of the library, or anything else you may need, please tell you and work with CRT.
We are here to help support and communicate if needed.
If you have a secret or a problem, please send a e-mail to Bryan Judah - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be viewed as leaving our job and our obligations.
Rather, they recognize that in this period of time, our work, our obligations, will likely need to be adjusted as never before.
These measures, which are believed to be necessary in order to support one another in order to continue the work, to give our group the support they need, and to give the land to which you rely.
The work we have planned will be waiting for it in time.
In the meantime, it is time to support one another and to create an opportunity for important work that may be available on weekends and in the months ahead.
We need all of you to do that, so all of you need to take care of yourself and your family so that you are fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, we ask -- open your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CrT (Manda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Gregory D, Gregory V, James V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the Leader's Group (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The b'Angiotensin-conversing enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an external enzyme (in cells) of cells in the lungs, veins, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 works against the effectiveness of angiotensin-conventing enzyme (ACE) by reducing the number of angiotenstensin-I and increasing the Ang (1-7) makes it a promising drug for treating heart and blood. ACE2 also serves as a cell replacement for certain coronavirus.
A person's type of enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-conversing enzyme 2 is a talloenzyme with azin in the face of endoreals and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-offline per-leading M2 and C-terminal collactrin renal communicationsporter code.
ACE2 is a single-line membrane protein, with its enzymes exposed to the face of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
An ACE2 enzyme is separated from the transmember stem by the enzyme known as shedase, and the dissolved protein is extracted from the blood and finally released into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most of the body cells: ACE2 is linked to the membrane of the cell, mostly to the cells of the second type of Alvelar, small intracytes, or even the nerve cells of the cell and the venous cells of the endocial nerve and an acidic tissue in most of the body.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in Cerebral cortex, stritum, hypothalamus, and brains.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE secretary.
ACE distinguishes angiotensin hormone from vascontricating anaotensin II.
ACE2 splits the carboxyl-terminal has an axylene from ANgiotenin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tal-Tyr-Ile-His-HEA) and divides it into vodilator Anaotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ilus His-PRO-OH).
ACE2 can also distinguish several otherpeptides involving [des-Arg9]bradykin, alumin, naurotensin, dynorrhin A, andghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the movement of the neurotral membrane amino-transporter SLC6A19 and is linked to Hartnup disease.
As a transmember protein, ACE2 acts as a primary entrance to certain coronavirus cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (SARS infection); and SARS-COV2 (the virus causing COV-19).
Pointedly, the combination of SARS-CoV and SARS-COV2 in the ACE2 enzyme in the front of the cells results in endocytosis and the movement of both the virus and the enzymes to the endosomes between cells.
This procedure also requires that the S Protein is enabled by the serine proteasse TMPRS2, which is under current research as the cause of the disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing the ACE2 genes, in the cell, may help combat the infection.
However, many of the major organizations and operating bodies have promoted continued with the usual ACE prevention and ARV treatment.
"Accredited review and analysis printed on July 11, 2012, found that "ACE prevention" was associated with a 34% reduction in pneumonia risk compared with the authorities."
"Despite this," the risk of pneumonia has been reduced to patients treated by ACE prevention prevention patients who have been at greater risk for pneumonia, particularly those of stroke and heart disease.
"ACE prevention has also been linked to a decrease in the mortality of pneumonia, although the effects are less serious than the damage that pneumonia can cause."
A component of the ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new method of treating severe lung damage, and it seems to improve the flow of oxygen from alpolysacharide-dixed spondic disease syndrome.
Half of the rhACE2 people take 10 hours to work and start working after 30 minutes more than the 24- hour (time).
One study shows that RhACE2 can be the ideal medicine for those who cannot drink the normal reniningiotententententensom inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases when the angiotensin II is turning into a violent disorder. The full recovery of hhACE2 has been examined in the medical research of acate respiratry syndrome.
"BCOVID-19" are software programs designed to help you locate numbers in regard to the 20th coronavirus epidemic, such as the human find process (" or "to be caught") that they may have had contact with an infected person.
A number of programs have been developed or have been considered, thanks to government legislation in some places.
It has been established for the construction of the application applications to be touched.
Secret anxiety has been expressed, especially about the chemicals based on following the location of the tape users.
Other methods that do not need confidential information include the use of missionaries in Bluetooth to replace the user’s place in other young ones.
On October 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would build a path to support such applets in Bluetooth directly to the OS of Androd and the OS.
In China, the Chinese government, working with the Arpay, has established an apple that allows citizens to check whether they have contacted people with CoVID-19.
It is used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an applet is used by the Trace Together.
"This applet was developed by local IT staff, released as an open product and offered by the government. In North Macedonia it was released "Stop Korona!", "App which works on Bluetooth to follow exposure to people who may be infected and given immediate response to health authorities."
The appendix was established by the Department of Communications and Technology and the Department of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, this application has been expected to be valid by Google Plain and Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the government said that man’s search pup was at the advanced stage of the invention, and it was to be available for release in a few weeks. A similar apple is being prepared in Ireland, and France (“Stop Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand consider the Apps based on Singapore's Apple Togeter and BlueTrace protocol. Russia has intended to create an obvious apple when one crosss the boundaries set for the COVID-19 patients who live in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of safety at Cambridge University, lists a number of factors that can be a problem with the appendix muscles, which include misleading warnings and the chances of not getting any warning if the apple powers are limited to only a small number of people.
To solve the problems associated with the spread of the applet "cronovirus" which is misleading or dangerous, the Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus to his App race, said it would be only that "law" or trust organizations.
Google and Amazon have created a similar barrier.
Secret - rights partners have expressed their concern about the problems of human research using coronavirus popps, particularly as to whether the search plan designed to handle the coronavirus epidemic will be checked after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have issued a statement that sets limits on this kind of search.
These agencies have established nine policies on government policy:
"The search should be "lawed", necessary and suitable."
awareness of the period of watch and search should have the issues of sunsets;
The use of the chart will be limited to the plans of CoVID-19;
The protection of the devil and the unknown names will have to be protected and shown as protection based on evidence;
a comprehensive study should avoid reducing the wrongness of prejudice and reducing the value of things;
or any sharing of the day with the people shall be judged by the law;
will need to be on guard against abuses and civil rights to respond to abuse;
"To share in a useful way for all" participating" will be required, which includes public health professionals and small groups. The German Chaos Camper Club (CCCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohgenen) (RSF) also issue tests.
The proposed Gogle/applet program aims to resolve the routine track problem by removing the filtering operation from the OS VCDs when no longer required.
Other countries that have used space detection based on the building rather than the apples, which eliminate both the need to distill the applet and avoid follow-up.
In Israel, a search based on a network was granted.
Solutions based on a network that can reach the bottom of a shallow area can pose serious confidential problems.
However, not all sessions have large servers to get to the bottom of a person’s property; the number of secret - protection systems has been built using large servers to connect only (see footnote).
In South Korea, an application not based on the apple was used for man's follow-up.
Instead of using a selected applet, the steamer collects information to collect from various sources that includes a radar map to follow the latest wave and a card listing, and combine this to send messages by text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this knowledge to warn people who might be infected, the government also makes knowledge of the land available to the public, which is allowed because of many changes in the laws of secrecy after the MENS eruption in that country.
This knowledge is available to the public by the applications and cassettes. Germany's nations are considering using both the main stamps and those which protect privacy.
Since April 6, 2020, details have not been published.
The series of privacy prevention is a well-formed method, with many research publications from as far back as April 7,2020, that more than 12 professional groups were looking for solutions that accept secrecy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to get closer to the user and other young ones.
PPP-PT, however, is an attempt to connect which contains both major and various methods, and is not a single proprietary protocol. Various protocols include Decentrality-PPPT/DPP-3T, the Temporary Contact objects (TCN, the Factact Exact Objects, CEN), the PCEN, and the P comets-Mchasty (PAP).
In these profilings, the human net never leaves a suitcase, and all the connections take place in a vibrating cycle.
The Privacy Group in MIT Media Lab has always established the SafePaths, the platform for use of privacy prevention strategies when collecting and using the position or net of the bridge to follow the spread of COVID-19.
“ Based on research on white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Mansing Personal Privacy in an Epidemiic" published in March 2020. The same effort is the SafETrace platform of EnigmaMPC, a company that developed the technical skill originally established at MIT MIT Media Lab.
The SafeTrace uses safety technology to allow users to communicate with each other with the affected area and health and with other users and the legal authorities, without putting the net at risk.
On April 5, 2020, the international TCN Coalition was established by groups that were closely identified with the very different proprietors, with the goal of reducing the division, and allowing international application of the various applications to detect and warn, an important factor in the general acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that he had issued an invitation for the Bluerace protocol used by its official post.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, young Andoroid and IOS firms, announced a method of searching for people, and asserted that they would protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography technology.
They also publish features of electronic media that have been used in electronic media.
In accordance with Apple and Google, the stamp is intended to be issued in three categories:
the disposal of equipment to allow governments to build legal talents that handle the coronavirus protection of privacy
the installation of this element directly in the order of the OS and AndioidGogle and Apple to correct problems of initial and constant vigilance by sending the session with OS returns, and then removing it in the same way as the threat has passed.
The b 'Drug repositioning (also known as reuse of medicine, re-profing, re-tasking orrapeutic twitching) is to reuse approved medication to treat another disease or health condition that is different from the one that was built up.
This is the type of scientific research currently being done to develop the safe and effective treatment of COVID-19.

Remmediavir was built and developed by Gilead Sciences as a medicine for treating Ebola virus and Marburg diseases. Gilead Sciences found that Remmediavir had work to fight the virus against theviro-viro virus, pneummo-, paramyxo-conna.
One problem with antiviral therapy is to develop a treatment for mutations that can lead to serious and contagious diseases.
The first study suggests that remudesivir may have a high genetic barrier to the use of drugs. There are several continuous medical studies, including two in Cleveland University Hospitals; one for moderate cases and one for those with serious illnesses.
There are three continuous medical studies of vitamin C scans for hospitalization and serious cases with COVID-19; two anti-substantial drugs (in China, Canada) and one non-invasive (Italy).

Since SARS-COV2 is a virus, scientists have concentrated more on reuse of anti-viral drugs that were developed by early epidemics such as the MERS virus, SARS, and West Nile.
Ribalin: ribbarin was suggested to treat COVID-19 in accordance with 7 Chinese regulations
Umifenovir: Mitifefinovir was suggested to treat COVID-19 in terms of 7 of Chinese instruction programmes.
Some antibiotics that have been found to be reuseable in the treatment of CoVID-19:
Tolizmab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Allowed in China.
In research also in Italy and China. Also look at Tolizmab#COVID-19.
The goal of a b, COVID-19 is a well-conavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no end to medical research, there are still many persistent efforts to develop such a goal.
Toward the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it would not expect the goal of SARS-COV2, the virus that causes it, to be identified under 18 months.
Five vaccination lists in Part I Security Research in April.
The CoVID 19 was obtained in December 2019.
A massive explosion spread around the world in 2020, leading to a major financial and research project to establish a goal.
Many organizations use genes to set goals for SARS-COV2.
Since April, the key features of CEPI project are fast, cut down, produced, and accessible on earth.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technical platforms had been studied and established in early 2020 to set up an active goal against COVID-19.
The activities of large platforms that advanced in the safety research of Article I include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (the founder of the Category I and the object category: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
regulvector (the founder of Article I and the object calendar: Canno Biologics, adenovirus type 5 verctor)
As CEPI scientists were reported in April, 15 dates are in the first stages of the development of the goal, and 78 are confirmed as a pathogensic (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 are advertised, but very little public knowledge is available (likely planned or started).
The II Research examines pre-sumatic safety, usually planned, controlled by a vaccine, and is still in many institutions, while more accurate, effective levels are considered.
The study of Article III often involves more participants, which include a panel of controls, and the workings of an objective examination to prevent disease, while serious results are being discovered in the proper size.
"In 79 pre-programmed dates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 774 have not yet been tested to the public (in research "before" treatment").

In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities combined operations to locate large IBM computers, combined with the Hawlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some goals have the effect of other living things, also called unexplained results.
That means they can have far - reaching consequences of the disease they prevent.
One informal study in Australia requires 4,170 health workers.
It may be that the goals you set are not safe or effective.
The first study of objective experiments using animal models at CoVID-19, such as the ACE2 mouse, other brothetri, and human - related animals, shows the need for efforts to protect against the 3 virus in handling bacteria, and to cooperate with other countries to ensure safe systems that work everywhere.
The objectives of SARS and MERS have been examined by animal models.
Since 2020, no SARS security plan has proved safe and effective in the community.
According to the results of research published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of new goals and drugs in SARS treatment was a major concern of governments and public health services worldwide. Neither is available for MENS.
As MES spread, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful basis for establishing goals and treatment of the MERS-CoV virus.
Since March 2020, there has been one goal (DNA) of the MENS (DNA) that has completed a class of medical research among the people, and the other three are still being investigated, and all are the goals of regul-vectors, adenoviral-vectors (HedOx1-MMERS, BRS-GamVac), and two MVA-VA-VES).
Communication rooms are promoting the idea that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and that the goal is already found.
The covers quoted in the various communication rooms refer to the already existing genes as well as the goals of other coronavirus relatives such as SARS coronavirus.
The b virus 'Coronovirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a related infectious virus caused by arsperate respiratry syndrome 2 (SARS-COV2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and cough.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, odor loss, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to early symptoms is usually five days but from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result from symptoms of disease, some result in increased pneumonia and multiple organ deaths.
Since 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 56,000 people have recovered. This virus is spread mainly among contacts, usually through tiny droplets of coughing, coughing, or speech.
Although these droplets release from the air, they often fall to the ground or to the floor rather than into the long distance.
People may also be infected by touching an infected area and then affect their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive in a process of about 72 hours.
It is very common during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, though it can spread before the symptoms of the disease and later stages of infection. A common method of testing is the transmigration by hydraulic radiation.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who suspect that they are infected with the virus and their caregivers.
The suggestion to use a mask varies from person to person, some authorities say that it is not used, others that it is not used, and still others that require use.
At present, there is no objective or specific treatment against the COVID-19 virus.
The transmission of the virus has been found in many countries in all six parts of WHO.
Those infected may have no symptoms or symptoms such as fever, fever, fatigue, and denial.
Symptoms of an emergency include continuous respiratory difficulty, persistent chest pain or stress, confusion, difficulty in getting awake, and a weak face and lips; a doctor’s assistance is encouraged as soon as these symptoms appear.
Strange as it may seem, such signs of breathing above such as a sneeze, a cough, or a painful throat may appear.
The symptoms of disease from the mouth to the waist like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in varying degrees.
Some incidents in China began only to cause chest strength and heartbeat.
In others, the disease can spread to pneumonia, kill many organs, and kill.
This is also called the age of signs of disease.
The period of symptoms of CoVID-19 is usually five to six days but can be from two to 14 days.
7.5% of people with symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of those who do not have symptoms in transmitting disease to others is still not fully known; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of infected people who do not display the symptoms of the disease is now unknown and researched, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people have been without symptoms while hospitalized.
China's National Health Commission began to include cases of non-treated symptoms in its daily figures on 1 April 1; of the 166 virus that day, of 111 (78%), there were no symptoms when tested.
Both the cough and the saliva can include the virus.
Expressing a comment gives a couple of moments rather than a general tone.
A study in Singapore found that a climb without a covering can lead to a conical movement of about 15 feet [4.5 m] (15 fathoms).
Although the virus is usually not transmitted to the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be passed through the ventilation and air collection of air in the lungs outside the rooms of the human population released contaminated samples of the RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures such as the injection of a tube and the cadiopulmonary resuitation (CPR) can cause the production of particles to be released from the air and resulted in breathing.
While there is concern that it can spread through the sewer, the risk is considered to be small; the virus is very contagious when people have symptoms; while the outbreak may occur before the onset of symptoms, the risk is minimal.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is still not fully clear how easy it is for the virus to spread, one person usually affects two or three people. The virus lives longer and longer days.
In particular, the virus was found to survive one day on the board, about three days on plastics (polypropylene) and iron (AASI 304), and about four hours from a zero zero.
This varies, however, from moisture to heat.
soap can also be effective when used properly; soap products reduce the protective membrane of the virus, kill it, and remove it from the skin and other places.
Some soaps, such as balkonium chloride and chloxexine gluconate (the cause of the surgical environment), do not work properly. In Hong Kong research, saliva samples are taken two days after first being admitted to the hospital.
Of the five of the six patients, the first sample showed the number of high infection, and the sixth patient showed the number of high infection on the second day was tested.
The spratomy syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the worst spiratry syndrome, first released from three people with pneumonia and then contracted many of the worst respiratory diseases in Wuphan.
All areas of the new SARS-COV2 virus are derived from coronavirus.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which explodes its protective lung. SARS-COV2 is closely related to SARS-COV.
The lungs are the most affected members of the COVID-19 because the virus enters the primary cells by an enzyme called angiotensin-conversing enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is made up of a much more than 2 types of alphaler cells in the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter into the main cell.
The most serious heart injury was found in 12% of cases of heart disease at the hospital in Wunhan, China, and is most likely in serious diseases.
High levels of cardiovascular disease, causing muscle swelling and immune disorders during the spread of the disease, but serious heart attacks may also be related to the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are more obvious in the heart and are involved in the working of the heart.
The case of Thromosis (31%) and venousthroendomism (25%) is found in the ICU patients with the COVID-19 virus and may be related to the weakened prognosis. The diagnosis of people killed by COVID-19 showed the drawuse alveler damage (DAD), and the outbreak with lymphoccytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV2 contains ACE2-expressing epidural hyperactivity, serious COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hypinflammation.
Specially, Phogenic GM-CSF-setting T-cells seemed to match the discovery of IL-6-setting monocytes and the causes of serious illness in patients with COVID-19.
The lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported during autopsies.
WHO has published a number of microbiologists for testing the virus.
The normal method of checking is to provide an alternative TransScriptural mode (rTRT-PCR).
Tests are usually done in breathing samples obtained from the cane moth; however, a noseb or a spoutum sample can also be used.
The results are usually achieved within a few hours to two days.
Blood screening can be used, but this requires two units of blood taken between two weeks and has little value at the time.
Chinese scientists were able to separate part of the coronavirus and to produce a series of chemical reactions so that bacteria around the world can develop their own test of polymerase reaction (PCR) to identify the virus.
Beginning on April 4, 2020, a study of the properties of the disease (to obtain active bacteria and if one has been infected) was developed, but it has not been widely used.
Chinese studies show that accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States authorized the first medical examination on March 21, 2020, that was used at the end of that month. The plans issued by the Zongnan Hospital of the Houston University suggested treatment methods based on the treatment factors and the risk of disease control.
The brateral voltivated glincher-glass levels are spread by peripheral, symmetry, and polytheryor that are common in infection.
Subpulul dominence, crayy plate (lower pressure by vibule alveler fevering), and consolation may appear as the disease progresses.
A small puzzle available by the microscopic interfaces and cothophysiology of CoVID-19.
The main factors that were found in research are these:
macroscopy: pilisy, percarditis, hung Consoledation and pulmonary oedma
Four types of pneumonia virus can be seen:
common pneumonia: pulmonary oedemma, pneuccyte hyperplasia, marge anatial pneucocytes, interstilatial inflammation with lymphocycotic initability and multicized cell structure.
critical pneumonia: affuse avear damaage (DAD) and adffuse alvear exedates.
DAD is the cause of an ASPRODS and hypoxemia.
treatable pneumonia: exedata mixtures in the Alvelar Cavities and pulmonary intersatial fibrosis
Blood: disserrated intrascular coagulation (DIC); teleukorythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds, adapting to mouth and noses and noses and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC encourages closing the mouth and nose with a nose when coughing or sneezing and encourages using the inside of the cable when there is no way out.
Proper washing of hands after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC encourages the use of a mask while in the public, in part to reduce infection from people with no infectious symptoms. Refraction tactics are designed to reduce the contact between infected persons and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, to prevent the flow and transfer of large gatherings.
Alternative guidelines include that people live at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
"No known tree is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since the goal is not expected until 2021, the leading control system of COVID-19 attempts to reduce the numbers of those infected with the virus, called "" to make the line flat."
The CDC also encourages regular hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before and after eating, coughing, and urination.
It also encourages the use of at least 60% of alcohol - based narcoleta, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In places where hand-ins are not readily available, WHO provides two ways to produce it locally.
In these ways, antimicrobial function comes from ethanol or sopropanol.
"Sidrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria from alcohol; "It's not the virus that kills the hands"."
Glycerol is installed to create moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include fluid treatment, oxygen treatment, and support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected wear a normal mask.
Theexrorporeal membmbrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of breathing loss, but its benefits are still considered.
Cleanliness, health, and nutrition have been promoted to prevent infection.
Treatments that support the body can be helpful to those with mild symptoms who are newly infected. WHO and China National Health Commission have published recommendations to care for hospital victims with COVID-19.
U.S. consavists and U.S. Pulmononologists include treatments from various agencies at a free source, IBCC.
Since April 2020, there is no treatment for COVID-19.
When symptoms appear, some doctors promote paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen.
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmitting infection to another person, especially in the treatment centers when procedures may produce aerosolsols, such as intulence or hinchitis.
For mental - health practitioners, the CDC recommends the maintenance of a person in Airborne Ilationalization Room (AIRR) in addition to using common measures, to prevent contact and smell infection. The CDC explains the guidelines for the use of human protein development (PPPPE) during the epidemic.
Requirements: PPPE, espirator or facial mask, eye protection, and bandages. When found, rispirators (in place of facial masks) are encouraged.
N95 respirators are authorized to use in industry, but FDA allows masks to be used under Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
It is designed to protect against air particles like dust, but the protection of a certain body account is not guaranteed in its use.
If masks are not available, the CDC suggests using Faces or, if there is no other way, artificial masks.
Most situations of CoVID-19 are not too bad to require mechanical interest or other ways, but some require it.
The type of respiratory support for people associated with CoVID-19 is being studied with hospital patients, and there is some evidence that the inturbation can be prevented with high blood and sal cannula or bi-levevetive conditionia.
Whether these two lead to the same advantage for those who are seriously ill is not known.
Some doctors are willing to stay with aninvasive mechanical threshold when it is available because this method reduces the spread of recombinant particles compared with high blood and salcandula. The worst conditions are common among adults (more than 60 years old, mostly 80).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, reducing the number of cases resulting in a failure to handle the sudden increase in the number of emergency cases in the hospital.
One study in China found 5% in the worst - affected area, 2.3% in need of adequate assistance, and 1.5% died.
In China, nearly 30% of hospital patients with CoVID-19 were eventually admitted to the ICU.
Pathration machines become more complicated as the air pressure pressure level (ARDS) is developed in COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
Pathletators with high levels of stress control and PEP are needed to increase oxygen supply while reduced the risk of lung damage related to manilators and pneumonia.
PEEP may not be found in old manilators.
Medical research began in January 2020, and several drugs against the virus are in the medical field.
Demsivir seems to be the most effective.
Although new drugs are still being developed, a number of new medications are already authorized to be used or improved in testing.
Antiretroviral drugs can be tried by people with a serious infection.
WHO encourages volunteers to take part in the research and safety of medicines that can be used to treat. FDA has temporarily approved the convalent plasma as a research method in cases where there is a serious side effects.
It has not gone into the medical research needed to prove that it is safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, China was established for a youth's appendix to handle the outbreak of the virus.
Users are asked to enter the name and ID number.
This app is able to see 'if you are close to someone' using a search net that may be dangerous to infection.
All users can take note of the situation of three other users.
If the situation appears to be dangerous, the apple not only encourages isolation, but also warns health authorities. The analysis of more information about the young person's reputations, facial awareness technology, telephone tracking, and developed knowledge is used in kidnapping infected people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel authorized social security agencies to follow a young telephone net of people suspected of having coronavirus.
This is done to separate them from the community and to protect those who may have contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, the Deutsche Teslem shared with the German government's satellite and channel, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia developed face - to - face technology to find violators of the law of separation from society.
"The Italian public health officer Giulio Galila said that it was told to young workers that "40% of the people continue to travel"."
The German government has run a 48 - hour - a - weekend computer competition for 422,000 participants.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has issued a national declaration of resolutions to prevent the epidemic of coronavirus.
People may experience the stress of living on their own, being prevented from leaving, negative side effects of treatment, or fear of contracting a virus in itself.
"BBC is a segregated by Rory O'Connor, "A continuing social isolation, loneliness, concern for health, depression and economic collapse is a hurricane that affects people's minds and their well-being."
A virus may have fewer or less side effects, similar to other common respiratory infections as a common cold.
Common cases are cured between two weeks, while those infected with a serious or serious virus can take three to six weeks to recover.
Women who are pregnant may be at greater risk of the serious infectious virus of CoVID-19 on the basis of radiation from other same germs, such as SARS andMERS, but the disorder of COVID-19 is rare. For some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
For those who are most affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into an atmosphere of stress syndrome (ARDS) causing damage to the breathing system, sprock or kill many organs.
The problems associated with CoVID-19 include Sepsis, vanormal diseases and heart damage, kidneys, and liver.
The knots, particularly the increase in prothromin time, are found in 6% of those who are admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, while kidney malfunctions appear to 4% of the group.
About 20% of people with COVID-19 show high liver enzymes (transminas).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms of disease and death is ten days, and five are spent in the hospital.
However, patients transmitted to the ICU have about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the study of early events, the average time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, a total of six days to 411.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8% while the mortality rate is 1.7%.
The metastastics of the body’s lungs show adffuse radar and the cell fibroyxoid in both lungs.
The change of the bravil chatopathic was reflected in the pneucytes.
The lung image showed a set of specimens syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was noted for high trotons or heart rate.
According to March of this year from the United States, 89% of those admitted to the hospital already had diseases. The availability of medical and economic factors and the community may contribute to the deaths of people.
Estimates of human death due to such differences in regions vary, but also because of difficulties in methods used.
A few less severe cases may make the death toll even higher than expected.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases of previously infected people may mean that the mortality rate is now lower.
Smokers have 1.4 times higher risk of detecting serious symptoms of CoVID-19 and the risk is about 2.4 times more likely to get emergency care or death compared to nonsmokers. Concern has been shown about pre-prescription diseases.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a drop from 20% to 30% in the effectiveness of some infected persons, and lung scans indicate that it may be damaged.
This can also lead to a post - traumatic infection after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known that the previous virus could help with the most practical and long - term protection of the infected people.
The defense against the virus appears to be possible, based on other coronaviruss, but it has been reported conditions in which the recovery of COVID-19 has been followed by a reverse test of coronavirus later.
These conditions are thought to be an increase in the virus, not a recontamination.
It is thought that the virus is natural and is derived from an animal, so it entered humans.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the virus was probably guided entirely by its transmission from person to person.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of CoVID-19, published in January 2020 in Lancet, indicated that the first day of the outbreak of the disease is 1 December 2019.
The WHO official documents reported that the first symptoms of disease occurred on December 8, 2019.
A number of death - dealing methods are widely used.
These figures vary according to the region and over time and depend on the quality of the diagnosis, the chemistry of medicine, medicine, time since the first explosions and the characteristics of people as age, sex, and health.
Toward the end of 2017, WHO distributed emergency checks at ICD-10, U7.1 killed by the SARS-COV2 virus confirmed by the branch and the U.S.2 who was killed by COVD-19 tested by the COVD-19 screens without the SARS-CoV2 verified virus. The proportion of the killers shows the number of deaths separated by the number of donors during the given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the average death rate worldwide is 6.9% (153,822/42,240,191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies from one region to another. Other methods include the spread factorrate (CFR), which shows the percentage of professional deaths due to the virus, and infidelity rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of people who are infected (i.e.e., by example) who die of the virus.
These figures are not based on time and follow the number of individuals from infection to environmental resolution.
Although not all infected are infected, the presence of antibodies can give insight to how many people are infected.
In an area where most infected persons in Italy, at Castigione d'Adda, a small quarter of 4,600, 80 (.7%) are already dead.
In Ganget, the virus was aggravated by Carnival gatherings, and entered the youth, which caused lower mortality rates, and not all who died of COVID-19 were officially recognized as infected.
In addition, German health service still has no large numbers.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may be infected, as blood donors have examined.
The 69 (00% of the population) are confirmed that they were killed by COVID-19.
The effects of an epidemic and the rate of death differ from that of men and women.
The death toll is high for men in research conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest danger for men when they are 50, and the gap between men and women is confined only to 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The main reasons for this difference are not known, but genetic factors and behavior can be a factor.
The sexually based disparity, the low number of female smokers and men who suffer from other cases of hypertension at an early age can contribute to the higher mortality rate of men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people are males, and 72% of those killed by CoVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the US government does not follow the sextant of the COVID-19 virus.
Studies indicate that such widespread illnesses as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
The highest number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be infected.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official term of the virus would be "COVID-19".
WHO's prime minister Tedros Adanom Gheberyesus explained that CO stands for corona, BI represents vrus, D stands for diasse, and 19 means the year on which the first outbreak was marked: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen not to be named by a particular location (such as China), animal or group of people, in accordance with the suggested estimates of different countries intended to prevent discrimination. The virus causing COVID-19 is called arspere respiratry syndrome 2 (SARS-COV2).
"WHO also uses "COVID-19" and "the virus that causes COVID-19" in public chats."
"Both disease and bacteria are often called "connavirus."
"Between the first outbreaks in Ouhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "connavirus" and "Hunavirus's coronavirus."
In January 2020, WHO suggested 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov accreative respiratry disease as terms that will be used for infection and disease in accordance with 2015's guidelines against the use of sites in the terms of disease and bacteria.
The official terms COVID-19 and SARS-COV2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Because of a shortage of resources in the production industry, some manufacturers publish medical products such as clubs and blockators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency with venilator valve, and the surgeon could not send it at the desired time, the local company used its equipment and printed the 100 requirement in one night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, speculations, false and misleading news appeared as to the origin, spread, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease and spread quickly on the Internet.
Humans seem to have the capacity to spread infection to other animals.
Research has failed to find evidence of the presence of pigs, ducks, and chickens by means of a virus.
There is no known cure or cure.
International research on the goals and medicines of CoVID- 19 is conducted by government agencies, schools and industrial researchers.
"For March, the World Health Organization started "" Research ITS" to check for the results of four anti-viral treatments that are currently available with high prospects of working."
No vaccine is available, but various ambulances work to develop vaccines.
The previous SARS-CoV function is used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 both use ACE2 receptor to fit into a person's cell.
Three vaccines are being studied.
First, researchers have intended to develop a vaccine against the virus.
The objective of the use of a virus such as this, whether it is active or dead, is to develop immune reactions to the new COVID-19 virus.
The second course, the subut vaccines, aims to set a goal that makes antibodies react to certain areas of the virus.
If it is SARS-COV2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third option is the goal of the nucleus acid (DNA or RNA goals, a new method of building a goal).
The aims of any of these methods will have to be checked for safety and performance. On March 16, 2020, the first study of the treatment began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The goal contains a free genetic code that is copied from the disease - causing virus. The development based on the cause of the disease has been suggested as the challenge of the creation of the SARS-COV2 goal, but this is not guaranteed.
There is more than 300 medical studies that have continued since April 2020.
Seven studies have examined the already prescribed treatment of malaria, involving four tests of hydrogenchloroquine or chloroquine.
Reinvasive drugs form a major part of research in China, and a nine - stage study of remsesivir therapy in a number of countries will send a report toward the end of April.
A powerful review of the medical origins of the plan of CoVID-19 and antiretrovir drug had begun, in April 2020. A number of antiviral drugs are being investigated in the treatment of remvisivevir, including remvisir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopipipivir/rivir/hor/lovir/horavir/horavir is mixed with the interfertat.
There was visible evidence of remmonsivir operation, in March 2020.
It has been seen an improvement in the treatment of patients that has been seen in the proper use of remsesivir.
A medical study of Article III is conducted in the US, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, formerly used for treating malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with unauthorized results.
However, a study of the results of research is proposed.
Health authorities in Korea and China encourage chloroquine to be used.
However, the Power Institute of Virology, while encouraging the daily average of one gram, notes that the amount is twice as high and can be fatal.
On the date 28, March 2020, FDA issued permission for the urgent use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the view of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The instructions for 7 Chinese programmes included interferenferon, marban, or Ramfinovir in the treatment of CoVID-19.
Unregistered diameter indicates that high levels of barivin are required to prevent SARS-CoV2 from intro.
The NATazoxandide has been suggested for the ongoing study of videos after showing a weak ban on SARS-COV2. Research shows that the first increase in protinming by Transmembne Prose Prose test 2 (TMPRSSS2) is essential to the SARS-CV2 intervention by the ACE2 barrier.
The tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine along with an Azithromycin or without them have large restrictions that have brought the medical community to find this treatment without continued research. Oseltavir does not prevent SARS-COV2 fromvitro and has an unknown role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The Cytokine disorder may be a problem in recent stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have elements of anti-cytokine storm. The Tolizumab has been added to medical guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after the completion of a small study.
A study of paragraph 2 that is not planned on the national team in Italy after showing the effects of the flu in people with a serious disease.
Combined with a blood test of serum ferritin to locate cytokines, it is intended to prevent this, which is thought to be the cause of the death of certain people affected.
The interleukin-6 receptor agency was authorized by FDA on the basis of previous research in treating stteroid refractory cytokine releazy syndrome, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no informal, controlled evidence that tolizmab is effective treatment for the RRS.
The transmission of the refined and powerful antibodies produced by the immune system of those who are healthy in COVID - 19 to the people who need it is examined as a way that does not require a few precautions.
This method was tried by SARS and the results are unknown.
Glavil and utilization is a expected method in which less effective treatment of the disease may cause protection against SARS-COV2.
However, other methods, such as cellular cytotoxicity based on the properties of disease and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other methods of treating the genes of disease, for example, are developed.
The production of Juvarentine serum, which contains a blood plasma component from infected patients and contains antibodies related to the virus, can be elevated to respond quickly.
Cronavirus diseases, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor in the Central Hospital of Ouhan, who later became infected and died from CoVID-19 after helping to sleep on the spread of the virus.
