The Welsh Ams are concerned that they will ‘ look like sloppys ’
They wonder how some among the AMs have changed the way they are called MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is being removed by plans for a change in the calling of the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs on all political lines is a reminder that this will call for ridicule.
One Labour AM level said they were afraid because there is a noise similar to Twp and Pwp.
To students outside Wales: According to Welsh tup, pwp is a fool, and pwp means sewage.
The Plaid AM Plan, which has been a very happy group and provided other names to which they can be selected.
The Welsh Conservative Age said that as a group they were willing to accept the word change but that the WWP is too close to the blast.

The actual Convention of the Assembly that reassigns the change of the name, said: "The decisive decision about this identification of members of the law will be a matter covered by the members of the council."
The Welsh Act 2017 Government gave the Welsh Association the right to change their name.
In June the Commission published the results of a community survey, which found much ridicule for the reform of the organization called the Welsh parliament.
In the case of the AMs calling commissions established by WMP and the public opinion has shown reliance on MWP.
The AMs have also included their own ideas, but this conflict will be a problem for Ellin Jones which has taken the lead in the development of the process of switching law in the coming weeks.
Retribution laws will involve a change in how the council has done it, including the AM declination laws and the order of the cups.
The AMs will have the last word in the matter of what shall be called when the law is discussed.
The Macedonians went on to the election to vote for a change in their country’s name.
The votes will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change their country's name into the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
This open vote occurs after attempting to resolve a decades - long paradox in the news of a neighboring country of Greece with its province named Macedonia.

"In the course of history, the older people with whom I witnessed say there was a week's dry spot on all the streets," which puts Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is no one to report.
He says that the disappearance of dry land is heard.
"People are participating in different ways today," he says.
"Contains are no longer useful where they met daily."
As for the congregations, he is deeply concerned because the profit from the sale of congregation goods will not last long and the people are like nothing else.
He went on to say that the churches could not be replaced by the living things that people could not help the established congregations.
Most of the people who buy apartments in these buildings are white people, and he said, "They will speed up the ban of these congregations, since they are less likely to be church members."
Both churches were built on the white plain before Harlem became the dark city of the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martins ten years later.

The St Martins congregation did not close your space, says Mr. Merweather.
What took place a few months ago in St Martins is a plate of concrete and concrete, some brought by congregation leaders and others by deacons.
The private head of the congregation has written a number of complaints that they don't want to impose on them the cost of building and colliding as averry they do not enter into the employment of those who attend the contract and build.
Some members of the congregation cried out inconsolably.

Lawmakers have stopped entry into the sea from Ponto beach at Casablad to have died at Conunitas for 48 hours to search for safety.
Gilles have explained that there are more than 35 varieties of sharks in this area but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbuty's Settings for UK Beauty Marketing
The Sainsbury will compete with Bots, Subpardug and Debenhams with its different stores in terms of beauty and professional help.
As part of their efforts to enter a fair market that can be donated to 2.8bn, one of the most developed markets in fashion and household items seems to be going backward. Large stores will start out in 11 stores throughout the country and then be distributed worldwide if it is successful.
The economic support of goods comes after markets are looking for ways to use land mines that have been exposed to a decline in the sale of household goods.
Sainsbury says it will repeat their products up to 3,000 and insert Revlon Esther Tweezman products and Dr. Paw Paw Paw once.
The ever - present products of Lorela Maybelline and Burt's bees will find more space with places with their special ads.
The market will also remove the face again so that the majority of their products will have only crops and fruits as many young buyers want it.
Moreover, the perfume vendor Fragance tap will experience water at the top of 2 sainsbury's stores at the first in Croydon in the spring and in the past decade and the second in Solly Oak at Birmingham on the outskirts of the year.

This new method comes after they sold their 281 stores to Celesio the owner of Lloyds pharmacy in 125 years ago.
Lloyds will also help to include the search for victims such as La Roche Posay and Vichys.
Marketing director Paul Mills said: “We have changed the appearance of our passports to please our customers.
We also put quality - training assistants ahead of time to enrich customers.
A variety of products are designed to withstand all the demands, and our stores put us into the kitchen and mean that we now enter all of the old shopping facilities.

A pig killed a Chinese farmer.
The farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in South China, according to news reports.
This man, who was Yuan's surname, was found dead, full of blood in the body at the Liuppanshui market in the province of Guizhou in southern China a week.
A pigs farmer is ready to add them to his bed in May 2005 in the Xining of Qinghai, China.
She has visited her cousin who lives in Yunnan in the same district on the third day to sell 15 pigs to market.

Menga article won Livingstone for 1-0 playing with Ringers
Dolly Mega’s first article won Livingstone
The newly raised Livingstone surprised Steven Gerard's Ringer, that he received his second defeat after 18 games as instructor of the Ibrox group.
The Menga article has become as different as the group Gary Holt has risen, with the hibernians lying in two.
Gerard’s group stopped to travel on premiership for the night and will meet the Hearts in the back, leaving them with six points on the weekend.
Prior to this, Rangers received the Rapid Vienna in Europe League for the fourth time.
At present Livingstone has not been won in 6 games, as coach Holt continues to lose since he closed the Kenny Miller’s space last month.
Living with poor visitors is a good opportunity for the Livingstone to catch
The Holt team must be very much ahead of them, their understanding has caused many of the Ringers problems.
Scott Robinson was given the opportunity but failed to strike the article directly at Allan Lithgow and hit Craig Halket with his head.
The family had prayed to let Ranger play in front of them, for they knew that they could be sedate with a set piece.
And it was the key to the development of the quality of the cap.
The Ringers made the fee-kick at Livingston found that to open the case, Declan Galagher and Robinson joined Menga, touched the ball and put the article in the middle of the box.

The paint is continued on the second floor, or Alfredo Moraloge, which Kelly had lost the ball.
Scott Pitmtman is blocked by the feet of the Rrangers and Allan McGregor and Lithgow left a ball in the Livingstone stage.

‘ Good' for the Livingston-Regularity.
Alaska Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A good game and results in Livingston.
Just by being a person, having a good play, they continue to pass the expected climb as they continue to climb.

Eddogan received a mixed reception in Cologne

The draw shows the differences between views of the guest who saw him as a hero in the German Turks and as a target to others.

Some people climb into the trees to escape the Sinamis, he says.
About 17700 persons were moved to 24 stations in Palu.
Photos taken by a bomb released by a disaster center showed many buildings and shops that collapsed, bridges collapsed, and a faith - inspiring satchel.
The quake continued to shake the coastal city for the rest of the weekend.
The series of earthquakes was identified in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Cooperation of Technology (BPT) says that the satellite released by the earthquake on Friday was 200 percent the power of an atom bomb that fell to Hiroshima in World War II.
The city logography, which sits at the end of a long, small section, may increase the size of the tsunami, they say.

"I think that means that the instructions are not sent," he says.

Once West: changed his mother's role to His.
The Kanny West whale changes its name to be Yes.

Mexico’s AMLOs do not want to use war against citizens
The President of Mexico appointed by Andres Manuel Lopez Orbrador has promised that he will not use the army against the population as this country approaches 50 years of blood attacks against the students.
The Lopez Orbrador promised on Saturday at the Telocolco Plaza that you should never use soldiers to pressure Mexicans.
The police were fired in a peaceful plaza show on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at that time when the movements of the latent students were concentrated throughout Latin America.
Lopez Orbrador has promised to support young Mexicans by offering monthly services to those who learn and open many public universities free of charge.
She says that unemployment and a lack of opportunities to learn attract youths to crime.
The U.S. must increase the support of A.I.
Since China is more active in I.A., the U.S. has to double the number which uses research in the field, says the researcher and AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The terms come from the various sides of the U.S. state and make an AI declaration, as the general U.S.
Meanwhile, China started its program last year: intended to be a 0.1 in AI in 2010.
"AAI research industry will be a good start, since all other countries are still far behind the U.S., and we want the next success in AI," says Lee.
Counterfeiting and financial support may double the possibility of an AI major success in the U.S., Lee told the CNNBC on this church discussion.
Lee, his book "AAI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order "was printed this month by Hughton Misslin Harturt, Sinovation Ventures, which he developed into one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980 ’ s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on the new AI, the most prominent American Othelo player, and later became vice president of the Microsoft Research and Director of the Google branch in China
Lee agreed to the U.S. pre- U.S. technology competition as the Supreme Office of the Robotics Challenge and asked when to be next, to help identify the following industries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to overcome government resources, says Lee.
"No China removes educational leaders; companies," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technical firms have used lights from universities to work on AI years later.
Lee said that the changes in the migration plan would also help the U.S. to reinforce their AI efforts.
"I think blue cards should be automatically operated on the PD from AI," he says.
The China Council of China has released the development of the subsequent Generation Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
The China National Natural Science Foundation has paid people money from educational institutions such as the way the Nationla Science Foundation and others contribute money to researchers, but the academic college is small in China, says Lee.
In the early part of the year, the Defense Department has replaced the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must include the public administration and the scholars, and the White House has announced the construction of a special set of Artifical Intelligence.
This month the DARPA has announced $2 billion in an AI Nex program.
The NSF, planted a $100 million per year in an AI survey.
Meanwhile, the American Constitution of the National Security Commission by Atiticial Intelligence is still valid.
The Macedonians choose whether to change the name of the country or not.
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to register the country's name for "The Republic of North Macedonia," a proposal to resolve a conflict with the Greek state which now recognizes the quality of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its province, goes on to say that their neighbors in the north of their route are looking for their territory and want to enter the NATO and EU.
Both governments signed a contract, but some say that changing this name means lowering the tradition of most Macedonians and Slavs
President Gjorge Ivanov said that they will not vote and protest vote makes the 50 percent of the people doubt that they will arrive until the campaign is approved.
The question in the election sheet reads: "You agree with the membership of NATO and EU on the Greek treaty."
In favor of the change of name, according to Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, the price you pay is the same as EU and Nato in Macedonia, some countries that have been devastated by Yugoslavia
"I came yesterday to vote in the sands of our country, so that young Macedonians will live well under the umbrella of the European Union because it explains all our warm health," says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, Skopje.
Even if it is not legally binding, enough members in parliament have said that they will accept the decision of the vote.
The change will require two thirds to eat a parliamentary union.
The national election commission stated that there were no reported cases of 1 p.m.
Yet, it was still in 16 per cent, with 34 percent of parliament’s past votes in 2016 when 66 percent registered them with their votes.
"I have come out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, voter in town, Skopje.
The Macedonian PM of Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia by changing the name of the country to join the NATO and European Union in Stromica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
In a parliament at Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov, 54, is preparing a scene and pulling seats in front of tents set up by those who are going to resist the reframatic.
"We may be NATO and EU, but we want to join and hold our heads, not through the service door," says Kavadarkov.
“ We are a poor, yet decent country.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonians, we can convert others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro- Asian Intelligence.
Prime Minister Zaev says that the membership of NATO will bring the necessary monetary growth in Macedonia, with an average of more than 20 per cent of the work force.
"I believe that 80 per cent of our population will cry with the EU and NATO," says Zaev after applying the vote.
He said that "Yes" effects "the guarantee of our future."
The poet was printed in Macedonia's Institute for Political Research and said between 30 and 43 percent of the votes were to participate – under expected conditions.
Another trucker, headed by Macedonia's Telma TV, was 57 per cent of the respondents for the election on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent says that the vote is true.
For the repherom to be successful, there must be 50 percent and one vote.
A failure of refram will reveal a major problem of the Western factor this took a long time in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the wall of the Brighton walls to pick up

But the challenging Schezer wishes to enter court on Sunday to face Colorado Rockies, this may be possible if the Rockies face problems in the playoffs, yet win one game by pointing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West and NL.

Trump speaks up in West Virginia
The president spent his speech in a state around his choice of Brett Kavanough in the Supreme Court when stressing the importance of the issued Republicans to the internal election and leadership.
"All that we have done is in the basket in November.
For five weeks before making the choice that is most important to our health.
This is one of the larger ones, mostly -- I don't run, but you can say that I’m running all the way, so I fight for the best seat," he said.
Trump is running, "You see this horrible, brutal group of tyrannical Democratics, this is what you see right now.
And they are willing to return to power in whatever way they can, so to speak, violence, and uncleanness.
They don't care who hurt them, nor who should kill them to control them and gain power, that is what they want to control and power, and will not give them.
The Democratics, according to him, are in the campaign of "rebellious and disturbing."
"And if you look at the past four days," he said, calling Democrats "unless, cruel, unclean and untrue."
Then he refers to the Senate Committee that calls Sen. Dianne Feinstein by name, which draws water to the masses.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you skip document?
Well, yes, I am.
No, no, as if one stood up - to - face did not tell me good news that I had never seen a person’s position so rich.
The labor group is no longer a congregation of anyone.
They no longer speak from their minds.
When Momentum's hoots in my group shut down my mouth, I was not surprised at all.
But I have already entered later on a group of workers who were told they are not welcome - just because of the speech in our thoughts.
My cousin Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because of opposing the Semitics.
In my case, those who wanted to have me shut up criticized me for agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the matter of the importance of a previously considered financial system, national security, Europe, and other surprises, Jeremy has already interviewed other leaders.
In the report of the Nottingham East staff group of the Friday convention, they say "We want the meetings to be fair and beneficial."
For nearly every second year I am the MP of my local crew, the GC sessions of the Fridays have been just a thing.
Sadly, I too do not go like public meetings, and the political promise of "green," has long since forgotten if, indeed, it has been there.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing views are no longer allowed in the company and that ideas are judged as to whether they are acceptable to the gang leaders.
This started soon after Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, who said that we had the same political views, have also felt that I could take sides with them — whether for national security or for the private EU market.
Anything I talk about in the community is no longer important and I’m going to come up with a vicious circle of social harassment that says I’m not free, that I’m not going to get rid of, that I’m not going to be in the gang.
And I am not the only one still facing this.
However, I know that I have more success than my own because the expressions referred to at me still tend to be political.
I am surprised that my colleagues still hold on to their work and their determination not to take themselves out of their sight in the face of sexual or racial prejudice.
One of the most frustrating things in this political era is how violent rates of bullying are now out - of - date.
Jeremy Corbyn said that last week the Labour Party must set limits.
The fact is that we no longer see this great church and are not confident of any change or laws to recruit a gang.
I have had many advice over the past two years being urged to take it down, not talking too much and it will be "I am ready."
But I don’t get involved in politics.
Ever since I met Labour 32 years ago as a student, I was offended by the government Thitchcher for not letting go of the school’s poor, I wanted to bring in the best public services to those who needed it most – perhaps as a local government government or government minister.
I have never hid myself in politics, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East can in any way be confused about the law of the land as well as the positions of rivals with current leadership.
For those who canceled a trip on Friday, all I can say that when the world moves forward to Brexit that will benefit householders, business, and our public ministry, I don't want to spend my time and honest strength with the Laur Party leader.
I really have one message that I have from Nottingham Momentum, for my colleagues, whether it is Labour or not: I count myself serving you and also promise that there will be no threat or political threat to me to do what I believe will be the best for all of you.

Ayr has 38-17 Melrose: Ayr which has never been split up
The two previous tries have lowered the final results, but Ayr is worthy of the credit for this modern - day great drama of Tennent's Premiership.

In all parts of Bolivia, the memory of coastline disappeared from Chile in the 19th century as the roots became clear – as it longed to go to the Pacific Ocean again.
Those prospects, perhaps beyond your age, are expected by the international court of rehabilitation on October 1.
" Bolivia has the Power, the spirit of unity and humility, and actually awaits the outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, a legal spokesman for Bolivia.

Evo Morales, a qualified president of Bolivia – facing a long election in the following year has much to do with him on Monday.

Far from fulfilling Bolivia’s objectives, the past four years may have been a setback.
"The issue of being allowed to use the sea has met with no permission from the authorities of Bolivia," says Zarate.
The speech of Morals that promotes violence hinders the cooperation of Chilean, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some time continue their discussions, but it will be very difficult to continue to reason with each other after this.
Since 1962, two countries have transferred representatives from one country to another.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in Hague, has broken down the charges that the court is too fast to make a decision.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "the unique opportunity to start a new time of communication with Chile" and the opportunity to“ establish 139 years of agreement on the things that will benefit both countries, and so on.
Calzidilla also denies that Milares – who has been one of the most prominent presidents of Latin America – used sea-based matters as a political basis.
" Bolivia will never discard its use of the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is the opportunity to prove that it needs to win the past."
The North Korea says that the cease-being of nuclear weapons will not happen unless they are able to trust America.
Ring Ho, a minister of the north of Korea, says that his country will not cease to be armed with nuclear weapons first unless they trust Washington.
R. was speaking on Saturday in a federal conference.
She appealed to America to follow her promises at an assembly in Singapore held by rival leaders.
His observation until the time of America. The national secretary Mike Pompio looks at the first elusive nuclear issue within three months of Singapore and Kim Jon One of North Korea.
Ri says it is an unrealistic dream that she has a continuing vaccine and a U.S. failure in a peace treaty in Korea that has caused North Korea to fall.
Washington was very careful not to make Pyongong announcements before he began destroying his weapons.
Both Kim and U.S. / American President Donald Trump needs a second conference.
However, there is a growing gap in whether Pyonggo is willing to give up arms that the world may view as the only safe way to escape.
Pompio plans to visit Pyonggo next month for Kim and Trump's second conference.
Paris fad shows much of the clothing on the head that comes to clothing stores near you
If you want to increase the list of your hats or simply avoid the sun altogether, don’t look far.

The highlight of Valentino's appearance was a long hat on the sides of a motorcycle with feathers and a plethora, which had oversight of the head of the dress shower.
Some items of large size include jewelry, a witch hat.
Thom Browne displays unusual masks in Halloween time.
Many masked masks look more like Hannibal Lecter than they appear to have been built by top - style designers.
Another structure that is similar to that of underwater life - style has breathing aids as well as glasses.
If you continue with a less - popular fashion approach, you can put yourself at risk.
Caravans predict that large hats may be on their way to the larger fields with shopping malls.
The large hat is next to I 'La Bomba', a two-footed hat that is the opening of this blocking sun, which appears on Rihanna' to Emily Ratajkowski.

John Edward: Language skills are important to the inhabitants of the continent.
Private schools in Scotland keep a record of good results, and this continues in the year 2018 with some positive results of a good examination, which is guaranteed only by the success of a person’s individual and his colleagues in sports, art, music, and other public endeavors.
With the dearest number of students in Scotland, these measures represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), point to a higher aid.
Private schools aim to prepare students for the highest educational level, as well as for the field they choose as citizens of the world.
As a educational department that can organize and embark on a special educational program, we see modern agriculture progressively becoming a famous and popular field as our preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man about a language he hears, what you say directly on his head."
If you speak to him in his native tongue, what you say reaches the heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we will not always rely on English if we want to build friendships and ties with people from other lands.
From the results of a study of the trials of this year, we can see that lemons are the most advanced in the field of development in private schools.
Thirty-eight of all the students who had learned the foreign agricultural language received the Upper A.
The index, gathered in the seventy-four schools of SCIS, shows that seventy-two percent of the students have got the Supreme Option A in Mandarin, since some seventy-two percent learn German, and sixty-nine percent of those who study French are of another sixty-three percent who learn Spanish as well as A.
This indicates that private schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as important skills for children, and undoubtedly young people will need them in the future.
It is now a field in which you can choose to study, viewed as the same subject (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in schools that represent education programs and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employny and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons why employers cannot shut down 17 percent (17 per cent) are made up of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are especially useful in preparing youths for the opportunities of work.
For many of the tasks expected of me covering the languages, these abilities are important in a united world.
Whatever field a person takes, if he reads a second field, he puts himself in the best position to develop the same skill as that one.
The ability to communicate directly with people from outside the country places one who is able to speak to many of the farmers in front of his rivals.
According to a study of more than 4000 adults of the UK (4000) in the year 2013, 7 and 5 percent (75) were unable to speak well in foreign fields and to communicate well, and French is the only middle of the population with only 2 per cent of the population, 15 15 percent.
That is why farming of agriculture is important to children today.
Having a number of mines you know, especially in developing countries, will help to rob children of opportunities for better employment.
In Scotland, schools and schools vary from language to culture.
Most of the schools focus on teaching older and younger crops, and some teach agriculture that is considered highly important in the UK in view of the year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japan.
Whatever your child likes, there are many kinds of vegetables you can choose from in private schools, and you will let the skilled ones in the area guide you.
Scotland's private schools are committed to providing a form of education that will prepare the children and deprive the children of the skills they need to succeed, this is the future that you will have.
In the present time, in the global business world, that agriculture will continue to play an important role in the world’s future, so this must be demonstrated in education.
In fact, modern agriculture must be included in the "international communication abilities."
Private schools will continue to offer themselves at this time, in contrast, and introduced to the young Scots.
You have to do it well.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

Trump's West Virginia Rally Time race game is shown in You Tube program
President Donald Trump begins the storm of the race with a traffic race at night at Wheeling, West Virgina.
The first Trump's race of five planned for the next week, involves standing in the neighborhood between Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote of vote to select a major court office, Trump aims to form followers in this general election as the Republicans are at risk of losing the synod’s ruling on the Moon.
Trump's option at West Virgina, when will it begin?
The Trump's choice at Wheeling, West Virginia will begin at seven o'clock in the evening. ET night, Saturday, 29 N.M. 2018.
You can look at Trump's choice in West Virginia by entering You Tube and observing what is happening now.
Trump may have led the church to a court hearing, Brett Kavanough, fueled by accusations of sexual offenses and a prospective officer of the Senate vote as the FBI is investigating.
However, the aim of this storm campaign is to help the Republicans gain the incentive to cope with the will of the Moon.
Hence, President Trump in his campaign said that the five - car races of the next week are intended to "inflate the volunteers and the followers as Republicans try to protect and increase the number of participants in parliament," according to Reuters.
"In control of the board is important to the president's program for visiting many countries that can be visited as we are engaged in the busy time of the project" argues against the mouth of Trump's campaign that denied the Reuters to reveal his name.
Organized for Westbanco Arena at Wheeling, modern motor races can bring followers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania" to be broadcast on contacts from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second of the two months Trump visited West Virginia, the country he won by more than 20 percent in the year 2016.
Trump is trying to assist someone who is entitled to join the West Virgina Republicate.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president will try to grant her a choice," says Simon Haeder, political adviser at West Virgina University, according to Reuters report.
The Ryder 2018 Calendar is confident that the American team will fight to keep the hopes available on a day's games on Sunday.
After a three-side meeting, on Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup games may have had to be four times more.
The most powerful weapon of all time is a program that is started with a program, but the players believe in it, not in comparison.
Where, then, are they going to say that they are stronger now?
"They lead six points and now are just four, so we continue as if by little power I think" says Jordan Spieth as they drive less than a day.
Europe has the chance, indeed, four points ahead of the twenty.
Americans, as noted by Spieth, have little joy and much to be encouraged, not by the way Spieth and Justin Thomas play together all day and each received three - to - four points.
Spieth has been dangerous and has been taking the lead as an example.
Those observing it were especially happy when he was, patiently playing the golf course is important if the game is the same as Thomas himself.
His golf he won the game by 15, this type claims that he believes that the American team has not yet gone out.
"You will really have to be deep and concerned about your game," says Spieth.
It has become one of the remaining performers.
18 mines to mark them.
The only more flat player than the Spieth and Thomas two days ago is the Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no question about the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but a marriage that is very kind and willing.
"Moliwood" is the only number that will not start bogy on Saturday afternoon, but avoid bogies on Saturdays in the morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
This speed, in a way that both of them are in this noisy crowd who conclude that they are the winners on Sunday, and no known athletes will be interested in conquering Europe as the sun rises over the Golf National Day rather than the Fleetwood or the Molinari.
Both mines are different
The talk about fame in Europe has not changed, yet it is.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson did little work for the Sergio Garcia, the morning urballs' warriors, when arrested by Alex Nore.
Bogey, the foremost doubbles, left a long gap between Spain and Swede, which they will not catch.
On Sunday, no one will help you get out of your pit.
Fourballs themselves enjoy watching closely because of the cooperation of the fathers, the counsel they give, the advice they offer, and the method of a device that can change quickly.
Europe has played well and grew as a group and led to the end, but the coversomes has shown that the OSA still had the power to continue, by choice of the United States, they were skeptical.
Europe has taken 10-6 the lead on the last day Ryder Cup.
Europe will be at the reception desk of the final day Ryder Cup after going out for hours on Saturdays at 10-6 leading in the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were twice as successful as captureing Tiger Woods on the Golf National Four.
On the European side, to be willing to play the cup they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the failure in America in the burgeons, set a 311 series.
The U.S. has put up a hard and hard fight for the motories, to win two games, but it will not just be built up abe.
On the side Jim Furyk needs nine points in the 12 Sunday games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European to gain a series of points in order when he himself, Minoliori, called "Molliwood" after a good weekend without playing for the winners in their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
By distinguishing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fo'c'sle and Bryson Dechambau of America in 5&4.
Woods, who has entered two Contestable games, showed great determination, but now she has lost 19 games in 29 tourballs together.
Justin Rose, who lives in the morning urballs, returned to Henrik Stenson to the currents in 21⁄2 to distinguish Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third classes in the world.
And they are willing to return to power in whatever way they can, so to speak, violence, and uncleanness.
The Jordan Spieth and Just Justini are three times able to distinguish the Americans by three points on Saturday.
Let them win 2⁄1 by separating Jon Rahm and Ian Polter of Spain from the Fourballs and then by Rory McIlroy in 4&3 on the currents while they were pointing out two opening mines.
In the history of the Ryder Cup only twice to have a group from four points to isolated games, on the other hand, Foryk needs only to measure to protect the cup.
After doing better for two days, or so, a Sunday attack seems to defeat them.
The North Korea says that ‘ he cannot be armed without any trust.
A foreign minister from North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that it continues to fan the flames of dishonesty in the United States and that it is impossible for the world to give up nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
RI Yong Ho told the world body of the General Assembly that North Korea had made "an amendment" last year, such as nuclear ban and nuclear testing, nuclear disarmament, and the promise of not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
He said, "Noma, we don't see any answers from the U.S.
"With distrust the U.S. will not hope to be protected in the world, and under this condition there is no way for us to do it first."
At the time it does not agree with the North Korea’s position on Washington’s refusal of the nuclear power while North Korea may be hailed by taking steps, the testament is a proof that it does not prevent nuclear disarmament as completely as Pyonggu did in the past.
Ri refers to a statement established by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump first met between the president of the U.S and the head of North Korea in June 12, when Kim asked to work in the "denucation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promises the preservation of North Korea.
The North Korea has been trying to bring an end to the Korean War of 1950-3, but the United States ordered Pyonggo to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has always refused to release North Korea.
"U.S. insists on "the end of the former" and sets down the levels of the law to carry out its intent by force, and also resist "a declaration to put an end to war" says R.
"Knowing that the law can humble us to the fantasy of people who don't care about us.
The problem is, though, that continuing to go on builds confidence in ourselves.
The U.S. leader from the United Nations did not reveal the plans to re-unite Kim and Trump that the U.S.
The minister introduced at least three seminars between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in five months ago and added: "If half of the ban on the ban in South Korea and not the U.S., the end of the Korean peninsula will not cause this commitment.
Even so, the sound of Ri's speech was quite different from that of the previous year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly this is the front place and the North Korea's rockets that took place after "Mr. Trump" called Kim "rocket man" in this case.
In this year the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "finally complete" North Korea, to elevate Kim's moral strength by armed action, but there is still much to be done and the law remains until North Korea is finished.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he doesn't have time for the whole thing, "if it takes two, three, or five years – it is safe."
Russia itself argued in favor of the U.N. Security Council to submit to Pyongji by the measures taken.
Nevertheless, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompio told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: The Security Council on Thursday: "The pressure of the Security Council must be exerted by force and fail until we see the end, fully, and the evidence of nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has agreed to support North Korea in breaking law since 2006 in establishing nuclear budgets and Pyonging policy.
Pompio met Ri and the U.N. General Assembly and said that after all we still visit and Pyongang in the next month for the second preparation.
Pompio has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been good.
He left Pyong in July, which has been made, only in North Korea, to identify him publicly "by force as a criminal."
North Korea arranges a meeting with Moon this month to finish the Mass area and the nuclear mixture if the United States takes "the same measures."
Kim said that she told me “by the same measures" she wanted to strengthen safety when Trump promised in Singapore and created a general atmosphere with Washington.
Harvard course students help them get enough sleep
The new Cores at Harvard University this year all who have not gone to sleep very well in order to overcome the withdrawal habit by using caffeine ‘ all night long. ’
Education classes have found many students at prestigious universities to be self - sufficient when it comes to the basics of a dog’s self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medication at Harvard Medical School and a professional at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has established the course, the first of this type, U.S.
You were encouraged to start the course after giving a talk on how sleep is affecting me in reading.
And at the end of it came to me, and said, Why am I told this now, in my middle year?
He said that no one had told him about sleep – that surprised me,' tell the Telem.
This year’s release of Course is the first issue of this year, explaining to readers the importance of sleep habits to help a camaraderie and exercise, and it improves the quality of daily life.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to die of course after learning that most students do not sleep at all during the week.
The length of the study involves a series of steps that are carried out.
The first section is a picture of the school room, where students choose coffee, restaurants, trainers, and books on the effects of caffeine as well as the light of exercise helps in sleep, as well as sleep patterns.
In one section, participants are told that staying out of sleep increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, insomnia, and cancer.
A compass map, with practical points, will then encourage those who share in encouraging them to think about their daily routine.
‘ We know that he will not quickly change the behavior of the students.
We believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke cigarettes,' adds Professor Czeisler.
The custom of boasting in ‘civilised' until' is a matter of practice, which means, in addition, that modern technology and excessive pressure on students reduces sleep levels that are a problem to the increase.
To make sure that you sleep enough, enough, it must be the student’s ‘ secret weapon ’ to overcome stress, fatigue, and anxiety, which means avoiding obesity, as sleeplessness puts the mind on the condition of hunger, making them drowsy.
Raymond Shuthi, a 19 - year - old student in California who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare a study, which he studied in one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He opened his eyes to the study and encouraged him to miss the study and then to attend the entire course.
The next step, in hopes, is to ask the high school students to study in the same way that this study program is before they join this center that has a steady competition.
Brof Czeisler recommends that students should consider checking the alarms when they go to sleep, and also that they are going to wake up, and understand the negative effect of ‘ blue light ’ released by electrical displays and LED light, which can get them out from the rhythm of movement, leading to the control level.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Ringers: Menstrants ’ article lowers Gerard’s men
The Ringers were ordered and gone when caught by Dolly Menga, who had attacked Steven Gerard's incomplete case and had lost 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox even intended to record their first victory since they won on February 41 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team contributes to the second defeat of Gerard in 18 games as the officer who left his back trial with eight points to the leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Imagine that you attack seven minutes before theharftime, and the players of Rangers endured without wavering.
By now the Ringers came down to the sixth place, Livingstone rises to the third place and behind Hibernians who differs from the article.
And there may also be a problem in the Rranges after a line in which the Clum Spence was first fitted after an accident caused by something thrown away away.
Garrard has made eight changes to the previous Ayr to Betred Cup synals.
Holt, on the other hand, took the same Good Book with him that had taken the point from the Hearts last week and would not rejoice over the way your well - dressed clothes had worn to keep his rivals cool in all directions.
The Ringers may have caught the ball very much, but Livingstone has done much with the ball he has found.
They would have collapsed in two minutes when Menga’s sleep sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s article but the stomach player lost a lot of opportunity in the park.
Keaghan Jacobs's freck has found Craig Halketoi-Skipper but his co-operal Alan Lithgow cut it far behind.
Rangers was able to control but more reliable than faith in their game during the last third stage of the game.
Alfred Morelos felt that he had had to get a pelty of our own while fighting with Steve Lawles, but with a pump Steven Thomson broke the Colombian request.
Rangers have been able to insert two points in the first half facing the pole but with the old Irromed Iram Kelly with no concern about the skull placed on the head of Lasshana Colulibaly and the lower assault of Ovie Ejaria.
When Livija dropped to the ground 34 times in the fall, no one could deny that it was worth it.
The Rangers again failed to resist Jacobs ’ ball game.
Scott Arfield did nothing about the time Declan Galagher hit Scott Robinson, who had lost him so easily.
Garrdube with the movement after vacation while changing Colubaly with Ryan Kent, and this change nearly intensified as the chimpanzee struck down to Morelos but Kelly, impressively bent down from her line to hide.
But Livingstone goes on to describe the audience by playing the game they play, as well as Lithgow and Halkett playing long footballs behind others.
The Holt's side could open the gap in the final stages, but McGregor stopped Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball on the corner.
The assistant Rrangers Glenn Middleton finds the tract a long time when he contends with Jacobs, but Thomson also looks aside.
Almanac: Geiger Couter
And now our page "Saturday" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and October... the day when tomorrow’s physics Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring the radio, which was developed that led to the final product of the Gerger Court.
The science’s thread since then, the Geger Couter who turned into the center of the papal pole, as in the 1950 "Bels of Coronado," in which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were eaten:
Man: ‘ What could that be? ’
Rogers: "The General Couter, is used to locate radar devices in the linears, such as uranium.
When you insert open airphones, you may be able to hear radiotics released by metabols.
Evans: "It's said, they're out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But this invention bears his name throughout all eternity.
A new cancer goal can teach the immune system to ‘ spot wrong cells. ’
A new cancer goal can teach the immune system to ‘ spot wrong cells and kill them
The goal is to teach ‘ seeing ’ the wrong cells as a treatment program.
The procedure involves taking the immune system cells from the patient, changed to the laboratory.
'They' see a common protin in many cancers and then reemerged
The goal of the drawing shows the promising results for patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman who is treated for a goal, who teaches the immune system to detect the wrong cells, saw breast cancer disappear for 18 months.
This method involves taking protective cells from the patient, being converted into a laboratory for "see" common protein in a number of cancers called HER2, and then recombination.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a promising goal."
HER2 "prof Berzofsky," which includes breast, uterus, lung, and other cancers, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The same way to take protective cells from patients is to teach them" how to understand cancer cells that have done well in treating some type of leukemia.
Once West was in the memory of Trump, clothed in the title of MGA, after he had come out with a linen cloth.
Not right
Once West was hailed at the Saturday Right Live after singing in honor of American President Donald Trump and saying that he would enter the election in 2020.
After singing her third night song, called after the Good Town on a cap with the America Great, she had started to sound with the Democratics and had guaranteed the erection of Trump.
"I often talk with the white man and say: ‘ How can you love Trump, and do you?'
If, I had been concerned about prejudice, I would have traveled to America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL has started a program with Matt Damon's chapter when a Hollywood hero scoffs at Brett Kavanagh's testimony before the Senate Judical Committee on sexual abuse cases by Christine Blasey Ford.
While it could not be spread, the West’s sound chapter was put on the radio stations by ridiculers Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock is attempting to discredit the West I wrote.
In addition, West complains to onlookers that he has been subjected to a vicious attack on the back of the platform and put it on his head.
"They beat me up behind the stage.
They said, 'You won't have that hat.'
They abused me!
They also said that I was still in the gang," he said, according to the Washington Judge.
West continues: "Do you want to see a place in the holes?" which means "I can wear his superman Cape, because it means you cannot tell him what to do. Do you want the world to continue?
Try to love.
He has not long been mentioned twice by shy SnL observers and SnL class members, Variety reported, one telling the printers: "There was a silence in the radio."
West was put under the seal of the singer Ariana Grande, his old boyfriend, Rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West had led many through the singing of the song I Love att, Dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West was relieved by the head of the old TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who put on the handle said: "Konno't have the amazing courage of the air: BEARING TOGETHER."
But the interview manager Karen Hunter wrote in a totter that West "is stealing the person who is sitting and just fine."
"But I have chosen not to recommend a person (by buying his music or his dress or setting his“ art ”) that I believe is built up and full of a dangerous idea in the community.
You are free.
So we are," he added.
Before the presentation, the Rapper appeared to Twitter to change his name, which is now to be called "Kone West."
He is not the first musician to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy, and Pddy.
The rapper’s team, Snoop Dog, was once called Snoap Lion with him, who had actually died while Prince, changed his name by sign and was named Prince.

HIV/Aids: China reports 14% to progress in new conditions.
China is announcing a 14% increase in the number of citizens who live with an algas and develop the virus.
More than 820,000 people were affected in the country, according to health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases have come.
Most of the new cases of sexual abuse are, in effect, changing from past to present.
But the number of people who receive this treatment has reduced almost to zero, Chinese health authorities saying so much at a meeting in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, the number of people living with the virus and presaged virus has risen to 100,000.
The virus now lowers a minor problem to the TBT Community.
The sex crime in China was rooted in 1997, but it is being discriminated against by people with similar sex.
Because of the way of life, studies have once revealed that 70 - 90 percent of men have had sexual relations with other men and that they end up married to women.
Much of the spread of disease comes from self - defense against sexual immorality in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to reach the world’s appeal to witchcraft as an attempt to deal with the problem.

In the U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters has issued charges that one of his employees puts a detail of three senators in the Republic of the U.S.
The Democratic of Los Angeles explained that the charges were spread by the fathers of "ultra-righting" and Web sites.
"A lie, lies, and a multitude of other horrible lies," said Waterers in a statement to Twitter.
The broken data includes home address and numbers of the U.S.
Information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, installed by a stranger to Capitol Hill when the Sanate Panel was placed on an issue of sexual misconduct by the Supreme Court Brett Kavanough.
The break occurs after Kavanagh is fitted with three senator questions.
Some long - time satellites such as Gateway Pundit and RedS State report that the IP address shows that Waterers's office is related to it and that it is the only source of Waters activity, reports Hill.
"These unprovable charges are false and false," continues Waterers.
"The good of my employees – the identity, the identity of the person, and the safety of the threatened as a result of false and false accusations – did not involve the theft.
These unfounded charges are absolutely false and false.
Waters' code soon became a criticism on the Internet, including the lead secretary of the White Housepress Ari Fleischer.
"This opposition can be tiring," writes Fleischer.
"This means he has no meekness of the Colonese Party.
If someone is criticized for something they have not done, they should not get tired.
They should not resist.
They should not criticize the accuser’s motives.
They must be cool and peaceable.
Fleischer would compare Waters' answer to criticism by the Democratic Judge Kavanaugug, who was accused of much of the criticism at the time of the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican assistant who will enter Waters's shoes in the mid-time selection, breathes his thoughts to Twitter.
"It's too big if true," writes to Twitter.
In his statement, Walters said that his office made known to the ‘ competent officials and the judicial board of the law on the charges of fraud.
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," continues, "and will be held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts in any place or all my workers."
The view of Johnny English Strikes Ain – lowers the power of Rowan Atkinson’s copper pypoof
It is now the custom to consider Brexit's worth of any British film and not even the resurrection of the Johnny English drama that began in 2003 with Johnny English and its return in 2011 the Johnny English Reborn.
Eating hot potatoes as we say in the article that we can have a new chance to sell out?
In any case, the open eye, the face of Johnny English’s gray - headedness that had the power to encourage new things a second time — that name is a great joke designed for theaters of non - English - speaking people.
Indeed he is an inexperienced spyer who even exceeds his unusual self-constitution will be the beauty of the Clousau, the Sir Bean's crown and his strength from the Charios of Fire to the opening festival of London 2012 Olympics.
It also comes from a traveler and a mysterious man named Atkinson who passed through the latest advertising notices in Barclay’s TV, who left the chaos of his resurrection.
There are at least two times in the present visit by JE.
I like Johnny English on a helicopter riding on an old suit of armor and small swords hanging on his helmet.
Atkinson’s humorous gift is a fairy display, but laughter looks down and is extremely exaggerated, especially in the production of such “deep ” films as 007 and the Midsion Impossiling itself now presents humor as an ingredient.
The jokes about us are about children rather than adults, and in my case Johnny English’s visit are uncommunicative and hardy in Atkinson’s silent film with the sounds and personality of Bean.
The story now is that Great Britain is in a large corner.
Thecyber-hacker entry into the secret network of British explorers, reveals a number of British cylinders in the field, which concerns the missions assigned to the work – it is a small task to Kevin Eldon.
The last minute in a self-constituter carrying and inexperience, which faces a failure in the political community: Emma Thompson tries hard to imitate Teresa-May but there is nothing more to the text to say about it.
His spies informed him that the whole spy had been abandoned, and he would have to be patient with the man in the pension.
This means that Johnny English himself, now like a scolmaster in an expensive area, but gives unprovable lessons to the observer: humor, as English offers the study of interrogations at Rock-type.
Englishujjill was brought to Whitehal to be given emergency orders and joined by a nurse Bough, also followed by Ben Miller.
Bough is still a married man, associated with the submarine commander, a pleasant place played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Therefore Batman and Robin to lay the full bed in the Queen's secret Service, which corresponds to Olga Kurylenko's beutil factory Overheatto.
There, the master munister quickly sinks into the millions of technological advances that he or she can solve computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their long journey: in hiding as a cat, they started a fire in a French restaurant; they started the problem with the luxury Volta; and English, which took off the puzzle while he learned to use the Virgin Real Headset to practice the Volt's house.
All efforts are made to improve the final session or to be friendly and energetic, than the children’s TV over everything.
Take a firm stand.
And like some of Johnny’s English films I could not hold myself: didn’t the British film industry have been able to give Rowan Atkinson a glimpse of his talent?
Labour denies that it was decided that Britons were to work four days but five days ’ wages
Jeremy Corbyn’s group of Labour contemplates a marvelous plan to see Britons working four victims – but paid five.
The team has reported that it requires company management to pass on the interest generated by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) by giving them more day.
The workers seem to enjoy the full three days of the week – but at the same time earn the same money.
The sources say that this view would suit the economic aim of the team and the policy to convert the nation to workers.
Changes to four days have been authorized by the Trades Union Congress as a means of taking the opportunity to change the economy.
An older source told The Sunday Times: ‘ Police checking is expected to be done before the end of the year.
'It will not happen at night but on four days in the church, but working four days is revealed by the means of a reconstitution group to reap workers and the whole idea of the whole state.'
Labour Party will not be the first to recommend a plan, and the Green Party bound for four days of work during its 2017 generalization camp.
The goal is not yet fixed by the entire Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for Labour Party said: ‘ The four days' job is not the institution's police and no group thought at all.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the last Labour church conference to express his view of evolution in the economy.
Menz McDonnell said he was willing to relax and the power returned to the ‘ unknown guides ’ and the ‘ bosses ’ in the industry firms.
Again, the Charter program also explains that the shafters in the water companies may not receive the entire chart as the Labour government does ‘ draw ’ in the wrong way.
He also made sure to put the staff on board boards and in Inclisive Unnership Funds to give 10 per cent of the master-ser dorms' to the crew, who will harvest the amount of less than £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy signed "60 Minutes" that the FBI research on Kabanagh could change their thinking.
A survey of the FBI judge Brett Kavanaug has delayed the election of the Supreme Court last week, and raise questions that the findings of the detectives can change the way the monarchs of Republicans influence the followers.
In a Sunday recorded discussion, the "60 Minutes" director of interviews Scott Pelley asked the Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or FBI if they can find something to change their minds.
Kennedy is more relaxed than her friends in South Carolina.
"I will say, really," says Kennedy.
"I am going to the side, and you, I have also spoken to the judge Kavanaug.
I called to him after doing this, and that suspicion went out, and said, "Did you do it?"
She is stubborn, curious and ignorant.
Graham’s note, however, appears to have been cut.
"My opinion has been decided by Brett Kavanough and will take strong criticism," he said.
"D. Ford, I don't know what is going on, but I know this: Brett is quick to deny," adds Graham, which explains Christine Good Ford.
"And not all the numbered confirmed this.
It has been 36-ars.
I don't see anything that changes.

How successful has the Global Citizen been in the 12 years that he has reached his goal?
Is the idea of people benefiting from free concerts the right way to try people to do something, or is something else called "clickviticism" – people who feel that they make a difference by signing a list on a computer or sending to a tot?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 of its members, the handling of different purposes.
It says that these acts have helped to keep the world’s tenants out of silence as well as the goals above $37 billion to affect the health of 2.25 billion population in 2030.
In 2018, a group picked up 390 ideas and identifying them from their actions, about $1.50 billion, or tried to be gathered.
The group estimates that the income is directly related to about 649 million people worldwide.

The group also said that over 5,000 years of calling the U.K. has improved the nutrition of the mother and children, the government has announced the support of the project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach the number of women and 5 million children by means of a healthful diet.
In response to some FAQs on their Web site asking "What do you think we can do to eliminate deep poverty?"
“ It will be a long and difficult course — sometimes we will fall and fail, ” answers the Global Catitzen.
But, as civil rights and anti-partheid complaints before us, we will prevail, because we are very strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and others sent to this New York party, which will be celebrated by Delorra-Le Furness and Hugh Jackman.

These stamps appear as the Trumps are making efforts to promote the export of their natural liquid gas into Europe, to replace Russia, the cheapest way for European consumers.

The position of the US has caused Germany to withdraw completely, confirming its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told the US to go beyond the EU mission of power and agreements between Berlin and Moscow.

The 18 provinces and the District of Columbia support a new legal effort to have a new U.S. project preventing protection from people who escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 provinces and circuits sent a commission to witnesses on Friday in Washington to support a person in need of protection against this goal, reports NBC News.

She said that her partners, "and her sons are violent gangsters," harassed her, but the U.S. officials did not accept her request for protection on July 20.
She has been settled in Texas.
State agencies supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce many people with requests for protection from the U.S.

The Attorney Generalal of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in his comments on Friday that is a new policy "for decades of state law, and international law."
"The law says that all requests for protection must be judged by the facts in each case of the request, and making a decision like this is a violation of the law," says a witness called by the court.
The lawyers also pointed out that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering into it would kill the U.S. economy, claiming that they might become businessmen and that they could ‘ create job opportunities. ’
The Attorney Generalis trained the new judges to protect the people who fled from domestic violence and criminal violence in June.
"People can be protected if they leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a certain group or political opinion," says Sesions in his declaration on June 11.
Protection was not intended to eliminate all the problems -- and even all the major problems people face daily throughout the world.

The U.S. ambassador charges to China 'pocket' for false advertising'
After a week the official Chinese newspaper has a four - page U.S. - sponsored U.S. and China, a U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using an American newspaper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke of China Daily's subscribed property at Des Moines Register - a Iowa newspaper that is purchased with a quick repacking appeal to China in an attempt to enter the election case of Nov. 6 in the U.S., which is what China refused.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was attempting to interfere with the U.S. election created what U.S. officials said to Reuters is a new category in the Washington campaign of China.
While it is not unusual for foreign governments to advertise their trade, Beijing and Washington are now caught in a growing commercial war that created an endless hold on exchange of goods.
China's demands at the beginning of the industrial war were aimed at arbitrates in such places as the Iowa supporting the Republic of Trump, say researchers from China and U.S.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former emperor in Iowa, who sent most of the agricultural goods to China, said Beijing to harm American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, writes Brasstad in Sunday news Des Moines Register, "it is twice this harassment by making false ads in our free newspaper."
"In the territories that have been distributed, the Chinese government has made it available in the popular American custom of free speech with a free paper by placing a paid ads in Des Moines Register," writes Brastad.
“ On the contrary, in the newspaper market here in Beijing, there are not many different opinions you will find and you will not see the real reaction of the different Chinese people who may have to experience the effects of China’s economic problem, if it is thought that the media look at the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that “one of China’s leading newspapers has escaped the opportunity to print his story, although he didn’t say which of the newspaper.
The Republicans Break Free Women Before the Middle Ages Because of Kavanagh’s Failure, Warns Critics
As many of the highest Republicans are awaiting and protecting the possibility of being admitted to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanagh to several charges of abuse, the analysts warn that the wood will be returned with the bully, particularly to the middle-and-the next age.
The lungs are high in this regard, and many Republicans are already showing themselves that they wanted to go ahead and choose.
Those things will no longer be corrected," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, tells The Hill in an article printed on Saturday.
Reeher said he was skeptical that the last attempts of Senator Jeff Flage (R-Ariton) that the FBI has made an investigation will suffice to make angry votes lower the lungs.
“ Women will never forget what happened yesterday - and November, ” says Karine Jean-Pierre, a red counselor and a national spokesman for the progressive group of Mve On on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted, "You come to November!" as they rioted at the Sennacherib hall as the Republicans govern the Judicary Committee prefers to continue and select Kavanagh despite the evidence conveyed by Dr. Christine Good Ford, reports Mic.
"The effect of the Democratics and the motivations will end," says Stu Rothenberg, an neutral politician, telling the media.
‘ People say it’s already hot; that’s true.
But it may be even higher, especially among women electives in cities and young candidates, aged 18-29, who, although not interested in the president, seldom vote.
Even before the Ford’s evidence is evident with the details of his threats against the possibility of the Supreme Court, analysts say that the timber could be returned with a promotion if the Republicans went ahead and confirmed it.
"This is then the damage to the GoP," says Michael Steele, who was chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the previous week, according to NBC News.
“ JUST concerning the committee vote or the last vote or that Kavanaug is put on a bench, about how the Republicans handle this and how they treat him, ” says Guy Cecil, director of the Prarioties USA, a group helping people choose Democratics, telling the news station.
However, the Americans appear to be divided by their belief in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaug, and are inclined to break down-Kabaug.
New figures from YouGov indicate that 41 percent of the people are definitely or to some degree not believing the Ford evidence, while 35 percent say that they are sure or to some degree believe what Kavanauga.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanagh definitely or that he was lying to some extent in the evidence he gave, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by the Flag, the FBI is now investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least one commentator, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford spoke before the Sanate Judiary Committee a week ago that Kavanagh had given her a drinking problem when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez says that a lawyer in the Supreme Court introduced his private parts to him during the course of your study in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Starts a New Internet Mixer With Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, is embarking on a program to compete with the culprit Facebook, the Amazon and Google.
A new technical project, Inupt, is a company built on the open platform of Berners-Le Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their signature will be kept and the information that people are allowed to access.
In a unique conversation with the Fast Company, Berners-Lie made a joke and said that the Inupt purpose of "to control the earth."
"We must do it now," says this work.
"It's history."
This applet uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "persal online" or POD archive.
It may also include lists of people, what you should do, a calendar, a music library, and other technical and human tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all are found in one hole and at the same time.
A notable feature of the POD store is that it depends on the user who can obtain any kind of information.
The company calls it the "dependence net."
The idea of Inupt, in harmony with CEO of the company John Bruce, is that the company has brought the license, proses and skills that are appropriate to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Le, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, non-professive workers with contracts for the project, and the founders of many volunteers.
Beginning this week, the world’s technological inventors may set up their applet using the tools available on the Inupt website.
Berners-Le said he and his group speaking with " Facebook and Google" as to whether they should or should not be brought to a complete change in which their entire business will change completely.
"We don't ask their permission.."
In another post in a column in a column printed on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that the Inupt "to provide power for trade and operational systems to help protect integrity and the new bridge bridge built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Comsortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Le has taken the lead in a discussion of neutrality.
Even when the Input was released, Berners- Lee will remain the founder and Director of the World Wide Web Konsortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I look forward to the beginning of this coming web period," adds Berners- Lee.

But we are on it.
I tell you that, at a time, there is a lot of message sent to you and that all was not good enough.
Trying to correct them, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not, it was a matter of government.
I promise that it will never happen again.
We will keep the five races from 6 - as often as we often do and try to please our followers and we have gone too far.
If the situation was not desired.

Millelson, who is in a bad mood, is laid on a bench in the Ryder Cur on Saturday
The American Phil Micahelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47rd Ryder Cup game, but he will have to raise the socks to avoid a embarrassing history.
Millelson, who will be playing on the same event for the next two years of 12 years, is seated on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk on the morning fourballs and Saturday foursomes.
Instead of being the leader, who often takes the lead in playing the United States, the five winner divided the day twice and worked in his game hoping to find out what was wrong with him.
Since he is not the best person to aim for the ball even if he has time for the game, the 48 - year - old performer does not qualify in the Rock National Games, where a large play is often a problem when you play a distant ball.
And if the place where you are going to play is not so much trouble, Wilson, who will be playing the ninth game on Sunday, will meet with British Prince Francesco Molinari, who was also able to play with Tommy Fleetsholdod, which is red to win four of their games on this week.
If these Americans, who lose four points in the 12 games of a single player, are well starting the game, the Mitchell's game can be a success.
Faryk has expressed his confidence in his colleagues, and he has not yet said anything else.
"He fully understands his role today, grabbed me by his back and held me by his arm and said he would be ready for the next day," says Furryk.
‘ You have great confidence.
He is a well - known athlete and has accomplished much in these groups in the past, as well as in the record.
I probably didn’t think of him playing two games.
I expected more, but that is what happened and that is what we think we should do.
He wants to play, like everyone else.
Millelson will record history last time Nick Foldo in the number of games he played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It may be his last game on Ryder Cup that has never resembled what he has accomplished as a player.
Millelson has won 18 times, and 20 played equal games, although Fryk says that his presence has improved the group.
"It's good to be with her, to laugh, to laugh, to laugh with people, and to be with her in the gang room," she has explained.
"I think young players have enjoyed being with him, and, on this week, it has been good to see you.
He does much more than just play.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that many points are meaningless
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that leading with many points to the final day of the parades in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a hard game.
Dane played the first game in Valderma, when a group with a Sever Balleros captain led five points over the Americans but finally one point, winning in 141 /132.
"Keep in mind that we had led many points from Valderema; we led the courses of Brookline, where we were eaten, and in Valderma, where we won, but with a few points," says Bjorn, in the photograph, after watching the 2011th School win by 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 to the Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in that group that it is not finished.
Do what you can in the future.
Go to it, and do all things in the right way.
It’s not finished until you’ve got the facts.
We have a goal, and it is an attempt to catch up with it, and that is what we focus on.
I have said this, focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we are well aware that there is more than that biggest team of players in the world.
Thrilled with the way his players played in a difficult play area, Bjorn has added: “I will never reach conclusions about this.
The next game is a different one.
The next day you will decide how each player will play, and that is different.
It’s good to go out and play with someone when things are going well, but if you play alone, there is a full exercise as a golf player.
That is the message you need to pass on to the players, that you do your best in the future.
Now, he leaves his partner behind and must go and do all he can.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better alone than they were covered, except the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three and four points.
Fryk himself knows both the eating and the victory on the last day, since he was once part of a triumphal group in Brookline before he was eaten while Europe "furthered miracles in Mednahh."
"I well remember," he says in reply when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the president of 1999, urged his players to play on the last day.
"We have 12 important games in the morning, but it may be good to start with the top gear as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw in Mednah.
As the motivation and enthusiasm persist, he adds great pressure to the central games.
We organized our players according to that and put our players in a way we thought would enable us to practice magic in the morning.
Thomas has been assigned to try to take the lead in fighting and returning from the game and facing Rory McIillroy in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Pulter and other Europeans in the top team.
"I went with this group in this way because I think it will be ready for the entire game," says Bjorn by the chosen players.
Germany’s warship has been resettled
A new version of the German Navy called Frigate had to begin to function in 2014 to replace the old Colld War-ra, but it will not exist until the next year because of the systems and the cost of the snowball, reports local news reports.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz," head of the new ship's Baden-Wuerttemberg-clutter, is now reduced to the first part of 2019, says Die Zeit newspaper quoting military counsel.
The ship was supposed to join Navy in 2014, but the problems that followed the eclipse swept the future of the determined project.
Four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-clas, which were single by Navy as far as 2007, are to replace Bremen-glass ships.
It is understandable that ships will have powerful guns, types of explosive bombs and hidden technology, such as the lack of location, infrared and noise.
Other important inventions include long - term maintenance periods that cannot be used for new ships until two years have passed at their destination.
However, further erosion means that an important development of warships - will give Germany overseas power - will have run out of time when it begins to function, says Die Zeit.
A vessel with a dead end of F125 appeared in paper last year, when Germany Navy refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohmbnasse-Voss, the ship's port in Hamburg.
This was the first time that Navy had returned the ship to where it was made after being brought.
Little is known about the reasons for the return of the ship, but German journalists said that there was much more to be concerned with the problem of the "superpacy" to make the warship useless when sent to the war.
The problems of Software were especially important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-clus would be used by a crew of 120 sailors - part of the old Bremen Class.
It also appears that the ship has a heavy weight beyond what is necessary to reduce its effectiveness and the possibility that Navy is able to insert things that will improve it in the future.
A measure of 7,000 "Rheinland-Pfalz" believes it had twice the same weight of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the problems of the insurance, the total cost of the project - including training of a crew has also been a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 1.4.1 million ($3.6bon) - from
The problems of new ships are very important as there are recent warnings that German naval power was falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, a German head of the parliamentary committee, agreed to the Navy that it is a good way to ‘ monitor the departure and entry of ships which can be used.'
The official said that problems have increased over a period of time, since older ships were no longer in use, but no ships are working in their place.
You are disappointed that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-clus has been able to join Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands area aims to reveal how bats use the design of the area when hunting.
It is hoped that the findings will give us a better understanding of the life of these unusual flying creatures and help to direct future conservation operations.
A study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual poptrelles and Daubenton bats with long black ears at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in certain areas to review the activities of bats throughout the course of the year.
The NHS personnel and volunteers will perform small tests using handheld monitors.
A reasonable analysis of all records will show the frequency of bats ’ cries and what some animals do.
The map of his area and the report will be produced to create a detailed picture of his life - style.
Rob Dewar, an NTS zoo consultant, hopes that the results will reveal what areas are most important to bats and how these animals use them.
This knowledge will help to see the benefits of the environmental control work such as the meadow Creation and the best way to preserve areas of fruit bats and other related animals.
Bats in Scotland and throughout the UK are rare throughout the past century.
They are threatened with construction and the creation of objects that affect their habitat and loss.
Electric appliances and lights can cause harm, and so can flies and log trees, as well as domestic cats.
The bats are not necessarily blind.
However, since they hunt at night, their ears are more active than their eyes if they hunt an animal.
They use some complex hearing aids to detect the source of sound to locate animals and places in the air.
The NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important fields and 76,000 acres [6,000 ha] of land throughout the country, considers bats to be important.
It has ten trained professionals, who make regular checkups, check their habitats and how to protect them.
The organization even organized the first Scotland park and the only bats in Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scotland's bats live.
The land manager David Thompson says that this is the ideal place to live in.
"Here in Threave is the best area of bats," he said.
‘ We have old buildings, many large trees, and other good places.
But there is so much about bats that we cannot do, so the work we do here and other buildings will help us understand more about what he needs in order to survive.
He emphasizes the importance of checking whether bats are available before working on the construction projects because destroying their one habitat would likely kill about 400 females and young ones, virtually all in the area.
The bats are protected, and the law does not permit them to be killed, tortured, or otherwise destroyed or destroyed.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to come to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and most of our species do not know what keeps them alive."
Ronaldo rejects accusations of abuse as lawyers plan to sell a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo spoke of the accusation that he had made a mockery of "false news" that people“ want to improve themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers arranged to charge the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published these charges.
This Portuguese performer and Juvenus is accused of sexually abusing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
It is reported that he has paid $375,000 to cover the case, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on a video in Instagram Live and his 142 million followers after hours of these complaints were reported, Ronaldo, who is 33 years old, has destroyed the reports saying, "This is false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false news," says an expert on the Ballon d'O five times on the camera.
"They try to create a name for themselves by using my own name.
It is normal.
They want to be in the performance by calling my name, but it’s part of the work.
I am happy, and everything is going well for me," adds the player, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to pay the Der Spiegel with these charges, calling them "unauthorized report of complaints affecting personal life," says Reuters.
A lawyer named Christian Schchertz said that the player will want to be returned money for "the damage of his dignity by the number equal to the magnitude of the guilt, which is probably the most serious violation of the recent human rights."
This reported case is said to have occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino room at Las Vegas.
After meeting on the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to return to the room of the player, where they are said to have attacked him, according to the papers posted on the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Myorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after this incident and told him that he was "good - for - nothing" with faults "one percent."
The commissions say that Ronalddoo agreed that they had sex with each other, but they had agreed.
Mayorga also admitted to the police and took photographs of the victims in the hospital, but later she admitted that the case had been taken out of the court because she felt "fears revenge" and is concerned about“ social embarrassment."
This 34 - year - old woman says that she now wants to reverse the contract as she continues to be hurt by what has been said.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid from the Manchester United while these complaints were reported, and this year you were transferred to the Italian superstructure of Juve to a 14100 million treaty.
Brexit: UK 'will always blame' for the loss of car manufacturers.
The UK "will always be sorry" if it will not lose its position as a lead worldwide in starting cars after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He has also added that “it bothers you" that Toyta UK tells BBC that if Britain leaves the EU out of the contract he will temporarily stop the product from his factory in Burma, near Derby.
"We need a contract," says Mr Clark.
This Japanese designer said that the result of delays in the border when an agreement with Brexit may result in a loss of jobs.
The Burkarston industry - forming the Auris and the Toyitas industry - produced some 150,000 cars last year and 90% are shipped to other countries in the European Union.
"I think that if Britain comes out of EU at the end of March, the product will stop our industry," says Marvin Cooke, the administrator at Toyota in Burma.
Some UK car manufacturers have threatened by leaving the EU without a contract on how to work with other countries, including the Honda, BMW, and the Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, will close its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit has passed.
Much of the concern is related primarily to what car designers call trouble if we fail to comply with the Brexit agreements.
Toyota's product is carried out “according to the need for that time, ” parts of cars arrive every 37 minutes from both UK and EU drivers according to radio vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU out of contract by 29 March, there may be disturbances on the border that the industry says would lead to drinking and closing parts of the motor.
It is impossible for Toyta to catch more than the day built in their factory at Derbyshire, says the company, so the product may have to be set up.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers program for future interaction with EU "was carefully adjusted to avoid that check on the border."
"We need to get a contract. We want to get the best agreement that we will permit as long as we will not only succeed now but also to hold on to this opportunity," informing the BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not only Toyata but also from other industries is that we need to be fully able to carry on with what has been a successful surgical chain."
Toyota could not specify how long the product will be stopped, but in time, it warns that increasing costs will reduce industrial efficiency and will eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsoubillaris, who has worked in Burkinaston for 24 years and who is an assistant in the United States, says his members are worried: ‘ That is what I have seen when the work is finished it doesn't go back.
A government spokesman says: “We have set a clear and reliable system of our future relationship with the EU.
The Trump and Rosenstein conference may be delayed again, says the White House
The eagerly anticipated Donald Trump and the attorney's assistant Rod Rosenstein may be "refited by another basket" as the high court battle and the setting of Brett Kavanagh continues, says The White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein directs the work of special commissioner Robert Mueller, which investigates the Russian elections, the communications between Trump and Russia and the possible disturbances of justice from the president.
Whether Trump will drive the attorney's rudder around, thus risking Mueller's freedom, has provided Washington news that can be discussed for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed in order to record a discussion with Trump and an opportunity for the president to be expelled with a 25-pounder.
Rosastein, quoted earlier, refused to accept the report.
But last Monday he has gone to White House, although there are reports that he is about to leave work.
Instead, to meet Trump, then located in the United Nations in New York, is announced that it will be Thursday.
Trump said that it was "pervisive" not to attack Rosenstein but that the meeting was delayed to be avoided against the case of the Senate Court where Kabanagh and one of the women who accused him of abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both became witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one - week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanagh, further lowering the full limit of Senate's vote.
Trump's secretary, Sarah Sanders, has appeared from the Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “The day of the massacre, it may be on this week, I think that it will be replaced by another check as there are other things going on with the high court.
But we will see and like to keep the news news to know what is going on.
Some news reporters may disagree: Sanders has never had a press conference in White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace has asked why.
Sanders said that the decrease in these meetings is not due to the fact that the media are "communicative," although he has said:“ I will not deny the fact that they talk."
He then points out that there will be a number of connections between Trump and media.
"The president made questions and answers better than any other president before him," he said, adding without any evidence: "We are watching for those numbers."
There will still be meetings, says Sanders, but "if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that is far better than talking to me.
We try to do that many times and have seen us do most of the last few weeks and will replace the news conference if you can speak with the president of the United States.
Trump usually listens to questions when he comes out of White House or when he shares in public displays or news reports with respected visitors.
Often, he is not asking questions in private.
The president of New York in this week has likely shown why, by being indifferent and, at times, by speaking thoughtlessly in front of the media.
A Health Secretary writes to EU staff at HS in Scotland about what Brexit is afraid
The Secretary of Health has sent EU personnel working in Scotland to show appreciation and worldly wishes for them to remain in post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter of 6 months before the UK dropped to EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed himself to pay the required cost of the EU citizens working for the public.
In his book, Msz Freeman wrote: “In the summer, the discussions between the UK and the EU have quietly continued, looking at the decisions expected in this field.
But the UK Government has also been preparing its policies to be off - line.
I know that this may not be the best time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the work of all members of the work, regardless of their nationality.
Our friends from the EU, and elsewhere, bring a billionth of value and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we work for.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay here.

Traders from other countries will be paid considerable rent while purchasing a house in the UK
Traders from other countries will be paid considerable rent when they buy a house in the UK so that this money will be used to help the homeless under the new system of Tory
This will make Corbyn’s success in obtaining young people to vote.
The increase in power costs will be required by those who do not pay the UK tax.
Financial resources expect to earn about £120 million a year to help homeless people
Buyers from other countries will be paid higher rent if they buy a house in the UK - this money to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May to announce today.
This will be considered an attempt to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in an attempt to persuade young people to vote up to obtain more affordable housing and to take a more expensive look.
The increase in power costs will work for the people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and this extra funds will help in an effort to eliminate the homeless.
This supplementation money - adding to the current cost of a smug, including high grades placed two years ago in the second - and - sold houses — about 3 percent.
Moneyholders expect this to give them about £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of London’s reconstructuring houses are purchased by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to locate houses.
Many of the wealthy in this area are particularly in the capital - then "citys are empty ” because of the high number of foreign consumers who spend most of their time away from the country.
A new project arrived a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke of a reduction in the price of a train to help more young people find their first houses.
He is responsible for the upsurge in building operations by taking up a building site and not using it, and urges Mrs. May to close the quadrants in the affordable houses to repair the British's "fuel."
Mr Corbyn has announced a sharp series of supposed changes in homes, including the management of rent and the removal of the house.
He also wants to give concrete strength to build new homes.
Mkz May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate myself to renew the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means restoring the sale of houses.
Britain will always be ready to welcome people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it would not be proper for non - UK people, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses more than British hardworking citizens.
For so many people the dream of having a house has become impossible, and the lack of freedom of sleep on the street doesn't disappear.
Jack Ross: ‘ My main desire is to be a Scottish instructor'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says that he has a "great desire" to be a Scottish instructor one day.
Ross, who is 42 years old, desires the challenge of helping the North-East group, now the third of the League One, left with three points by the top.
You have moved to Stadium of Light this summer after helping the StMirren back to Scottish Premiership in the past trouble.
“ I wanted to play my country while I was a player.
I got B Cap and finished," Ross told BBC Scotland'sporto.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland many times in Hampden when my father was young, and it has been my dream.
I can only get that opportunity, however, if I succeed as the instructor of a small group.
The pre-masters of the Ross in Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poolet and Paulo Di Canio.
Ross, who was an instructor for the Alloa Athletic, says that he did not fear to enter behind the main coaches in this large group, since he has refused applications from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success will now be checked if 'I can turn this group back to Premier League?'
Because of the structure and properties of this group, no doubt it should enter the Premier League, he said.
"It is easier for me to repay, but I will probably consider myself successful when I can return the group."
Ross has been an instructor for only three years, after a short time as an assistant trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months as an instructor in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa escape from the mines, and he converted the StMirren that was almost eaten by the nuts to the Championships on the next block.
And Ross says he feels more confident now than when he was a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, StMirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It was a complete change," he recalls, by training Alloa.
"I was absolutely convinced that the training work was better for me, than for me to play.
It sounds so ridiculous because I had a good time, a good life, and some things I enjoyed.
But playing is not easy.
There are many things you need to do every week.
I still do those things when it comes to stress and pressure from the work, but I love training.
For a long time I have wanted to train and now do it, and I know that I am doing something that I want to do all my life in old age.

The summer’s entry opens of Britain’s hard - earned envelopes but loaded the dining - room shopping malls.
Peasants and rubber are raised by people who buy 2.7 percent by July - but in restaurants down by 4.8 percent, says statistics.
Peter Martin, of the U.S.computer CGA, who discovered these figures, says: “The continued success and long - term in English association with the World Cup means that July has followed the same course as the previous month of June, where the lungs have risen by 2.8 percent, except that the restaurants remain low.
A 1.8 percent falling in sales at restaurants in June has been very serious in July.
Drinking envelopes and bars are more expensive than restaurants.
Fast - food pellets are also hard to bear in the sun, although they have not been as bad as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to get rid of them would get a drink.
In the lungs and bars the consumption of drinks increased by 6.6 percent this month, the food dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an entertainer and hosting RSM, says: ‘ These effects continue to advance what we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the outcome of large events or sports will remain powerful reasons when it comes to marketing.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to toil, although sales have dropped by 4.8 percent every year will be painful despite persistent cost problems.
A long hot summer has arrived at fast food stores, and in time it will be seen that the low temperature we have in August will give us what we need.
The increase in sales in the lungs and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a drop in record numbers.
The Coffer Peach Tracker’s company of rubber, rubber and UK restaurants, collects and analyzes the working net of 47 working groups, producing more than £9 million dollars, and is the beginning of a developing industry.

Eidh Doyle has been selected by the Scottish Alettic board as the director of the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a favorite Scottish performer and chairman Ian Beatie described this act as a good opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from his large - scale drama games over the past ten years.

The sale of breast pumping compared with bulldozers creates divisions on the Internet
A breast-packing company has created a broken apart on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feed mothers with domestic animals.
To mark the installation of what is said to be the "the world's first non-civial breast pump," Elvie’s clients's proprietary video commercial to show freedom to breast - feeding mothers.
Four mothers sing a song in a cowyard with the words: "Yes, I bend, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't see this, my breasts."
"Hap, take it out, take it out, nurse the children, take it out, take it out, take it out, feed my friends."
However, this advertisement, printed on the Facebook of the company, created a controversy on the Internet.
This film, which has already seen 77,000 and hundreds of compartments, finds a different opinion on observers, when many say that it looks down on the "weight" of the milk industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
As with us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, except that their babies are taken a few days after they are born," writes another.
Elvie breast pump coming in and hidden inside the feeding brothel (Elvie/Bather)
“ It is a difficult situation for both mother and baby, ” said another.
But why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?
Another said: "This is not appropriate."
Some protected the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she had found a song to be “laughter. ”
"I think this is a good idea.
I would buy it if I were still feeding.
Swimming made me feel like a cow.
The ads are extreme, but I have heard what they mean.
This product will be very useful, ” writes another.
Another has believed: “This ads make fun of and refer to mothers who are pumping (usually at work or in toilets) and feel“ like cattle. ”
This is not a commercial that honors or judges the milk industry.
At the end of the video a group of standers indicated that they had been dancing in secret pumps under their bra.
The aim of the campaign is based on the fact that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like cattle.
But Elvie Pum, which has no sound, no cords or tubes and wears it hidden under the breast, gives women freedom to move, take their children, and carry them out.
Ana Babarin, an ECD partner to the Mother, has observed: "Elvie Pump is a product that will have much effect on you so that you would have qualified for a more explicit form of advertising.
By comparing breast - feeding women to cattle, they wanted to put breast pumping with all their problems in public, while it illustrates in a pleasant and understandable way the feeling of relief from the new pump that they will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been a question.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children came from the cattalk of the designer Martha Jaboowski using this product.
Hundreds of Immigrants peacefully move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children has increased even though it has not changed the monthly average of passing through the border, in part because the hard-engage of the Trump's office has made it difficult to provide the children with support.
Often, many supporters are unemployed immigrants, and they have been afraid to risk their chances of living in this environment by identifying themselves as a parent.
The danger is worse in June, when the authorities announce that supporters and other adult members of the community at home will have to send the fingerprints, and that the net will be given to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, director of the Immigration and Customs Corporation, admitted before Congress that this agency has arrested many people who have registered to support the fatherless children.
The commission later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal cases.
"Almost 80 percent of the supporters or family members do so illegally, and the majority of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those people," says Mr.
In an effort to provide quick, officials have established new laws requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, not after 60 days, which was the former law, in accordance with the shelter staff.
Most will appear on the video conference, will not go literally, to ask for legal rights at the arbitrator.
Those considered unworthy will soon be deported.
If children stay in custody longer, there is more risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violence or attempting to run away, according to shelter workers and reports released from the session during the previous months.
The lawyers say that this concern grows in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs of child labor may be ignored, because of the size of the area.
They add that moving children to a tent town without taking time to prepare emotionally for them or to say farewell to friends can create many of the problems they already have.
Syria tells US, France and Turkey's invading forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Wald al-Moulem spoke to the refugees of Syria to return home, even if the war in his country is now in his eighth year.
Moulem, who is also the assistant of the prime minister, has ruled that foreign troops are in Syria illegally, that they will end terrorism, and "They will be dealt with properly."
"He must go immediately without conditions," tell the audience.
Moulem asserts that "wars and terrorism are virtually gone away" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to ‘ fight this holy war and cleanse the whole Syrian field ’ in terrorist groups and "and anyone from a foreign country."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who concentrate heavily on training and guiding the Curdish and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 military men in war-fighting countries.
Concerning refugees, Moulem has said that circumstances allow them to return, and he blames the "Some western countries" for the "studenting" which makes the refugees no longer returning.
He said, "We have spoken to the international community and to the welfare of the people to make sure that refugees return."
"They operate politics on a matter which should be handled only by the social community.
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not help his Syria again until a political treaty was made during Assad once against the end of the war.
The UN representatives say that a recent treaty between Russia and Turkey to form a border on the last major Idlib rebel camp was an opportunity to continue with political dialogue.
The Russian and Turkish treaty has prevented a massive attack on the Russian military forces backed up in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualeem stressed that the treaty had been given a clear time and hopes that soldiers will attack the jidists and the Nustra Fronts associated with Al-Qaeda, "which will be exterminated."
The UN ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon arrange the first meeting of a new committee that includes the government and opposing members so as to establish the constitution after the Syrian war and organize the preferred policy.
Moulem has set limits on the contribution of the Syrian government to the committee, saying that the postal work should keep up "by carefully observing the terms of the new constitution," and warned against a coupling.
Why Trump will win the second option
In that sense, Mr. Trump can win a second choice in 2020 unless, as there are many non-relenters who may wish to be, dishonest and wrong that would replace him to be president.
No doubt that will be the most significant conclusion in the history of the president!
So far, there is no indication that the observers are tired.
Since 2014, CNN viewers have doubled to 1.05 million and those who watch PMBC tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News usually has 2.4 million viewers, from 1.7 million in the last four years, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC "Rachel Madow Show" leading in more than 3.5 million viewers in the night news.
"People are curious because it is not something we understand," says Nel Baer, director of the ABC drama program called "Designed Survival," which is about the kabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on Capitol.
Nell Scovell, who is very red in the field of writing and setting up jokes called "Jant the Funny Parts: And a New Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another view.
You remember a text in Boston before the 2016 option.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
"He said, "Because you make me laugh," says Mrs. Scovell.
Listening and watching such scenes are pleasant.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. He is far away, no matter whether the immigrant families agree and the global economic situation exists.
Very few people are aware of these facts.
And, of course, it is more than a knowledgeable citizen if you find yourself sitting up for more than six hours on the information package that contradicts the use of Bob Woodward, a source of "deep roots" in his book "Fear," for Paul Manafort’s $15,000 white garment (" self-flatable thick garment," says The Washington Post) and the meaningful words of Storrs Daniels that analyzed Mr. Trump.
As for me, I will never again see Super Mario.
"Some of the activities that make it seem like a lot of a person’s life is to offer something every night," says Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheelhouse Environment and the founder of "Pawn Stars," dealing with changing people in the Trump order and everyday conversation (sociation with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was about 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C.] outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was in the room watching the MSNBC and recording the CNN.
It did not allow them to leave before him, as Brett Kavanaugus faced the Sanate Judiiary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was not guaranteed.
"I remember the past making all these symphonies and people say, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," says Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seemed they were right."

Money savings are inserted into the current session preferences of the House compete
It is no surprise that 17th, because of a restructuring of the consegor states that have come out with two officers in the same seat.
This recent Pittsburgh province puts him in the competition Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another region in a special election last spring year.
Lamb competes with another council, the Republiciscan Keith Rothfofs, currently representing the old Pennsylvania region of 12, which leads fully to 17 youth.
Maps were rewritten after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that older states violated the principle by stealing votes to Republicans.
The competition in this new 17s has removed the financial competition between the members of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campette (NRCC) (NTRCC).
The name Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a special appointment in March that was observed by many Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That position was held by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20-pounders.
The politicians have given Democratics a measure of opportunity.
The U.S. has considered El Salvador’s punishment for supporting China, and has become a contributing factor
The Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted Beijing, with a small appeal from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a free meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and served as a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Organization control team.
The State Department officials have decided to call again the American authorities of the Diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama concerning "and the recent decision not to cooperate with Taiwan," Heather Nauert, speaking at the door, says early this month.
But El Salvador is paid only, with $40 million to assist America in 2017, and to control narcatics, promoting and promoting economic support.
A minimum payment, including a reduction in financial support and limited limits on radiation, which could have caused the country Central America pain as a result of the increase in unemployment and murder.
As their meetings progressed, North and Central American officials delayed a high conference focusing on protecting and improving the economy to follow the same assembly last year that was considered a step forward of efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
But during September, the chief executive made it clear that they wanted the council to move forward, effectively ending any view of El Salvador's purchase.
President Mike Vence's assistant now has to plan to speak with the conference, now scheduled to be in mid - October, as the official sign of the conference, says the officials.
And three American representatives returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new strong orders or penalties from Washington.
The White House Speaker of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including the two delegates, who agreed to discuss private motives for the state of privacy.
Their accounts are verified by an external observer closely related to the authorities and spoke of a secret state.
A Lesson From History
The following case may be Robert Mueller’s special counselor’s report on Mr. Trump, and now there is a head of the public record.
Mr. Mueller is said to be investigating whether Mr. Trump was linked with Russia in its attempts to attack our choice.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will find himself facing the charges of this body, as he is preparing to stand before the votes, and perhaps finally before the court.
This has many implications, and I do not say that Mr. Trump’s fall is certain to occur or that his colleagues in Europe.
There are decisions that all of us should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the season.
In 1993, German officers were prepared to set up a coup d "état against Hitler, if only the West were against him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
History revolves around such scenes, and the endless struggle for the will of the public is strong or can be lost for years.
Americans are now facing many of these situations.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy General Rod Rosenstein, a person controlling Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the paper reported that, last year, he offered to record the president secretly and to speak about his inability to perform his work.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the story of The Times is wrong.
"How will we react if a new F.B.I. Brett Kabanagh survey is incomplete or unjust - or if he is admitted to a Supreme Court despite charges of sexual abuse and lying testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-century of Congress to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do so, the will of the public will not be long lasting.
But I believe we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish from Czechoslovakia who was exiled to Auschwitz, the same Nazi power that had once ruled over my agency.
She survived, moved to America and, after 60 years, sent me to light the Sabbath lights at a swastika table.
Having that heritage, how could it be that I am without hope for our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rranges hopes as the game and Rapid Vienna approaches
Rranges play at home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that taking the Austrians, after playing equally in Spain and Villarreal in front of this month, will put them in good chance of passing to the Group G of the Euppa League.
Traham Dorrans’s knee injury has prevented gastrointestinal player from playing for the first time in the tribulation until it has played as much as 2 to Villarreal but believes that Ringers can use those effects to look forward to big things.
"It's good to find this point because Villarreal is a good team," says a 31- year- old player.
“ We’ve come to the game believing we will come back with something, and we’ve got the point.
We may have obtained a gorilla at the end but, otherwise, an equal game is also good.
They played better than we did at the first stage and on the second stage became our best to play.
On Thursday, we play another European game.
We hope that we will find three points but that it will be a difficult game because they play well in the previous sport but, as our followers encourage us, I am sure we will play and get good results.
The past year, during all the things that have happened about my injuries and changes in the group itself, things seem to be better now.
A group is beautiful and happy; it is also fun when we are trained.
Hoping to work now, we have passed through the tragedy of the past and have succeeded.
Women cannot sleep because they are afraid of pension funds
Despite having a clear view of how to take care of them, few people had talked about it with their families.
Nearly half the people in a national survey claim to talk to their mate about the long - term cost of caregiving.
Only 10 percent claimed to talk to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't take steps to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, president of the Nationwide business.
Let the account come to life.
Talk to your spouse and children: You are unable to provide for your family if you do not keep your wishes to themselves.
Why not discuss with your family how to make ends meet? Because such decisions can have a powerful influence on how much money is spent.
Ask your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you get the funds needed to cover the expenses.
Your long - term financial decisions may include a long - term insurance policy, a life - insurance plan, a life - giving plan, to pay for these expenses or to be a health insurance policy as long as your income is still available.
Prepare your records of law: defend the wars of the law.
Get a health - care kit so that you can stop a trusted person from taking care of your medical treatment and make sure that doctors comply with your wishes if you are unable to speak.
Also, consider your money too.
He will choose someone he trusts to make decisions for you regarding your finances and to see to it that your expenses are being repaid if you can no longer do anything.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine your elderly parent experiencing a sudden health crisis and being rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and his condition?
Make a list of the details in an order to prepare for the situation.
"Not only money should be taken into account, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
‘ What trees?
Who will take care of the dog?

Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami
At least 384 people were killed by earthquakes and tsunamis in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, says officials, the number of the dead is expected to multiply.
Since communications are not effective, the relief workers could not get information from the Dongla authorities, the northern part of the Pacific near the center of 7.5 quakes.
In Palu, more than 166,000 people were arrested after these disasters occurred.
Here are some of the important facts about Palu and Dongla, on the island of Sulwesi:

This area, a region under the province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are a means of life in the Central Sulaways region, particularly the coastal region of Dongla.
The coins of the coins are also important in the region, mostly in Morowali, across the Sulwesi coast.
Palu and Donggla have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1993, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of Donggila houses.
The tsunami also invaded the western Donggela in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by an earthquake.
Here are some areas where major earthquakes and tsunamis have occurred in recent years:
In 2004: A great earthquake in western Indonesia’s Aceh region north of Sumatra in Dec. 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 276,000 people near the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the Aceh.
In 2005: A series of earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March to the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died in the Nias Island, which is far off along the coast of Sumatra.

State prosecutors want an unusual death sentence from a terrorist attack in the NYC.
New York State prosecutors are seeking the death sentence of Sayflo Saipov, a New York City terrorist attack that kills eight people -- an unusual sentence that has not been removed from the area since 1953.
Saipov, who is 30 years old, is said to have used the Home Depot to attack on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing people on foot and riding bicycles on the way in Oct.
In order to administer capital punishment, the prosecutors will have to show that Saipov had killed eight people and that "will have been severely wounded in the body, according to the announcement of an attempt to obtain death sentence, issued by the Southern District of New York.
Both acts bear the weight of the death penalty, in line with the court record.
After some weeks, the interrogation court filed the Saipov with 22 cases involving eight murder cases, often used by government prosecutors in organized criminal cases, and the crime of violence and vandalism.
The attack required "an order and good thought," said the prosecutors, describing how Saipov did it as "bad, cruel and shocking."
"Sayflo Habibulaevav Saipov killed families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Arian Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Palmuco, says a court announcement.
Five murdered were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the New York Southern District finally passed the death sentence.
The defendant, Khalilid Barnes, was charged with killing two drug workers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The time that ended the execution of the death sentence in New York’s case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being found guilty of stealing information from the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both the Rossenbergs were executed by the power seat on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is born in Uzbekistan, has shown that he has no heart in the days and months to follow the attack, according to the courts' records.
Tell the interrogators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had made such an attack on the SIS videos on his phone, in harmony with his part.
He also asked for an SIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
She said she has no side side to the 27-parted sides.
David Patton, public defender of Saipov, says that they are "missive as expected" by a court decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a sentence of death rather than to accept an appeal to be sent to prison without the opportunity of release will only expose the shock of these cases to all involved," says Patton.
The Saipov defense group had asked the prosecutors to refuse the death sentence.
The Tory Minister says that NIGEL FARGE should guide the talks and Brexit
Nigel Farage vowed 'to organize society' today during riots in Tory'.
A former Ukip leader said that politicians had to be ‘ tortured ’ by Euroscetics - as one of Theresa May minister who said that he should be the organizer of talks with EU.
An independent member of the parliament Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK 'had gone out' now if Mr Farage was the British Secretary.
But the challenge Mr. May to gather members of his separate group is noted by the older members of Tory who have participated in a different protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is unable to keep his Chequers schedule running smoothly despite the attacks of Brexit, Remainer and EU members.
Some members insist that they will continue to try to make a treaty with Brussels in spite of the conflict that existed - and force the Euroscetics and Labours to choose between his own space and 'rude'.
Mr Bone told a Leve Means Leve' protest at Solihull that he wants to ‘ finish with Chequers'.
He said that Mr Farage should be made a spar and assigned to communicate with Brussels.
'If you had been the one in charge, we would have gone out now,' he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough has added: ‘ I will defend Brexit but we need to finish with Chequers.'
Explaining his differences with the EU, he says, "We have not fought the world's wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in my country.'
Mr Bone has destroyed proposals that public opinion has changed since 2016: ‘ The idea that Britain's people have changed their minds and have wanted to stay away is very wrong.'
Andrea Junskys of Tory, who supports the Brexit, was also in the theater, telling the revelers: 'What I say, I say, I am a prime minister, listen to the people.
'People don't want Chequers, The opposing party won't vote them, our group doesn't want our own people who are walking the streets and causing us to be elected in the first place.
Please forget Cheques and start listening.'
In the straightforward order to go to Mkz May, he said: 'The prime minister continues to carry out their duties if they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the politician that they must be ‘ oppressed' if they forget the decisions they made in the 2016 file.
'This is now a matter of loyalty between us and our political class,' he said.
'They try to be disloyal to Brexit and are here today to tell us that 'We will never let you do that'.'
In a strong command he told the multitude, 'I want you to make them politicians, and they are now in danger of breaking free of Brexit, and feel oppressed.'
‘ We are using the world's society that has enabled us to conquer Brexit and will not give up and become an independent, independent country, the proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers have declared in Birmingham before having a two - hour contract in the city.
The main stamps carried the Tories Against Brexit after a group was established on the party.
Labour member Lord Adonis made fun of Conservatives about the security problems they had with the group applet when the mouse opened.
'These people who tell us that they can put the IT stamps and all Canada's technology and other, the trouble- free border, the free trade without borders with Ireland, added.
‘ It is total annihilation.
There is no such thing as good Brexit,' adds.
Warren's 'to ensure' access to president selections
The U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says that "you will look for the choice of the president's president's choice" after the November selection.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic described its future in the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to obtaining the geography of the land after following the guidance of the group that has enabled him to conquer Sebastian Vetel
It became evident that Valtter Bottas succeeded better than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the guides of the Mercedes team would play a major role in the competition.
From the beginning, Bottas started well and probably argued with Hamilton as he protected his position on the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his team.
Vettel first entered the pits and left Hamilton to be stopped by cars on the gangway, which should be the determining factor.
The Mercedes entered the pit after the cycle and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead of a collision that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inside harmless after two years of protection from the third corner.
Max Versappen started in the back row of the grid and became the seventh at the end of the first cycle on his 21st birthday.
He then leads a large part of the race as he has continued with his wheels to speed up the finish and pass Kimi Raikkonen to the fourth.
She finally reached the pits in the 44th cycle but was unable to increase her speed in the eighth rounds as Raikkkonen was the fourth.
It is a hard day because Valtter has done a good job all weekend and has been kind to me.
The group has done a commendable job with 2, says Hamilton.
His Body’s Swimming Skeleton for Him
President Donald Trump has made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein in the Saturday conference as he insisted that he had not shown anyone a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in defense of the Supreme Court defendant Brett Kavanagh on charges of sexual harassment.
Commenting on an organization in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony provided by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee, but noted that what had happened to the Sanate indicated that the people were "unreasonable and unkind and disloyal."
"One thing that could happen with a good thing that could happen a few days ago to Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and unkind and unreasonable and dishonest," he says.
“ When you look at broken news and say "Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, tell someone?
You remember his answer... someone sent you this dot - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't send anyone.
Well, wait for one minute.
We have sent him... No, we have not sent anyone, he says, referring to senator.
Feinstein was sent a detailed book on Kavanough's defense back in July, and it appeared at the beginning of September - but Feinstein denied that the dome left his office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't send anyone," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He has asked me to keep it secret and I have kept it secret just as he asked me."
But his denials made no impression on the president, who noted during a Saturday night gathering: ‘ Here is what I can say, his body movements are of the rich.
He may not have done it, but his body movements are rich.

"But because Paddington was real to me, it was as if you had a child had accomplished something: you take pride in it even if it didn't work.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success in that way.
Even though he had started with him and thought about him, he always praised Paddington.

A woman picks cards to prevent suicide in a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in death work together to prevent others from taking their life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been drawing cards on the Welsh bridge with encouraging words and telephone numbers that people can use for help.
Ms Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to experience depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I do every day," says Mrs. Davis.
Mksz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a cook with a promising future and that when he smiled, everyone would smile.
"All the people knew of her smile.
They always said that when there was a smile, everything was all right.
Nevertheless, he quit his job before he died, since he was very depressed.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the first to find him after suicide.
“ I’m always worried about something similar, ” said Mksz Davis.
Mrs. Davis began making cards, "To inform people that there are people who can talk to them, even if they can be friends.
Do not bottle up your feelings - to - speak.
Msz Humphreys, who had been a friend to Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15- year elder, shortly after the loss of his mother.
"He didn't say that he felt inferior or depressed or said something," he relates.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a different way of doing things.
He said that on Christmas Day he was in another way when the children opened their gifts, he never looked at them or did anything.
She said that her death was a source of much distress to them, but they had to cope with it: ‘ It opens the door to a big difference in the family.
It hurts us very much.
But all of us must continue to fight.

Brett Kavanough’s future is uncertain as the FBI is launching an inquiry
"I thought, if we really could find something like what she had been looking for - a quick, non-surface, ” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that she was afraid that the committee would be "divided" as many supporters.
Why did Mr Kabasaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do research?
Their lack of self - worth is due to time.
The mid-time option will reach five weeks, November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans will then be weakened in their efforts to find a person who wants them to be selected in the highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling on the Senators, encouraging them to support Mr Kavanaugough, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and there met his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr Bush.
What happens when the FBI has issued its report?
There will be a Sanate option, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democratics.
It is still not clear whether Mr Kavanaug can get about 50 votes from Senate, which will allow Mike Vence, the vice president, to divide equality and put him in the Supreme Court.
Northern Korea 's decline' under Kim
The number of heretics in Northern Korea has been decreasing since Kim Jong-un began ruling seven years ago, says South Korean legal scholar.
Park Mazeong-seug, quoting the details of the South's union door, says last year 1,127 - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park says that border rules have been established between North Korea and China and the high cost required by private workers is a major factor.
Pyonggo noted nothing in the community.
A large number of northern heretics are eventually granted legal rights as citizens in South Korea.
The Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled to China, with a long line that joins it in North Korea and it is easier to cross than the DMZ (DMZ) protected between the two Koreans.
China considers these heretics to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and carries them back to their homelands often by force.
The relationship between the North and the South and the present still in conflict has somehow improved dramatically in previous months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of these two countries had met in Pyonggo principally on the development of nuclear disarmament.
This took place after the historic June meeting between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on several methods of working to eliminate nuclear weapons in Korea.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Rong-ho blames the US authorities for not taking action since then.
"Unless the US trusts, there will be no hope for the security of our country and under those circumstances, we will never close our weapons on ourselves first," says Mr Ri in a talk to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanagh "control, ” saying that he is not qualified to work in the Supreme Court.
The head of the Minor Party of Houses Nancy Pelosi called the High Court’s choice Brett Kabanagh "controlled emotions" and said that his emotions would not allow him to work in the Supreme Court.
Perlosi says these words in a Saturday discussion in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I just thought that if a woman acted in this way, it would be said, 'Admiral'" Pelosi said his reply to Kavanagh' before Senate Judicary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaug has firmly denied that he has hit Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaug expressed his feelings, one of which was loud and calm as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also publicly dismissed the Democratics on the committee, calling the charges against them "the systematic distortion of the knowledge of a man to be killed" by men liable to have offended that Hillary Clinton was distinguished from the 2016 election.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanagh's evidence shows that he would fail to work in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is against the Democratics.
"I think he doesn't fit in with those words and how he spoke about the Clintons and the Democratics," he said.
Pelosi refused when asked if he could try to accuse Kavanagh of his appointment, and that Democrats received more seats from the House of Receptives.
"This is what I will say -- if he doesn’t speak the truth to Congress or FBI, it means he is not not only relevant to the Supreme Court, but also to be present in court," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi has added that as Democrat he is concerned that Kavanagh may judge against the Affordble Care Act or Roe v. He is tall, since it is thought to be a judge for it.
When asked, Kavanaug didn't answer questions as to whether he could answer certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotional person to go to court and be expected to say, 'It was all right,' says Pelosi.
And Women Need to Use Their Power.
Proper rebuke, months and years of burning anger, and there is no other way to release them without crying.
"We cry when we’re upset," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that is unusual, what do you say?"
He added, “I was greatly helped by a lady who was a manager of the cany, who said she was crying when he got upset, but she found out that when she was upset and cried, she would say to the person with whom she spoke, "You may think I’m upset because I cry.
I am angry.
Then he went further.
And I thought that was good.
Tears flow as a gentle outlet because they sorely need people.
One of my earliest memories, the office full of men, when I found myself crying out in a rage that I could not describe, was pulled to my knees by an inexplicably by an inexplicably on the stairs.
"Be sure you don't see you cry at all," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry with you.
They think you are upset and will be happy that they have found you.
Patricia Schroeder, became a Democratic conswoman from Colorado, and worked with Gary Hart when making a choice.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a ship called Montkey Business and was released from the election, Mksz. Schroeder, in a rage, saw that he could not fulfill his desire to enter the choice as president.
"It wasn't a well-determined decision," he said to me while he laughed some 30 years later.
"There were there seven others in the race, and the subject of ridicule they waited for another.
One calls it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was about to end, he had no money for auction, so he vowed that he would not enter the race until he could earn $2 million.
It was a war I could not win.
He found that some of his supporters who gave him $1,000 million in men could give him $250.
"They thought I got the wrong?" he wondered.
While declaring that he would not participate in an organized campaign, he was moved by feelings of appreciation for the people who supported him, the frustration of the ceremony that made it difficult to get together money and to search for people who would vote rather than for members, and the anger over the discrimination of women who have been caught up in it.
"You would think I was still in trouble," recalls Mrs. Schroeder and how the media reacted to him.
"You can think that Kleenex will be a tape recorder.
I remember thinking, ‘ What are they going to put in my grave? ’
"Stay"?"
How trade between US and China can be beneficial in Beijing
The salvos that open the war between US and China shut their ears, and as the war is far away from the end, the competition between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the future, say experts.
Donald Trump, US President, issued the first warning early this year by selling goods sent to China as well as gas, steel, and aluminum.
The largest case has occurred in this week with a new $200 billion factor (£150 billion), at the rate of half of all US goods coming from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in the same way, recently put 5 to 10 percent of American goods worth $60 million.
China has requested to be the equivalent of the US in a singlemashi, and the second world economy is less likely to fall soon.
To make Washington lower and lower is to close the corner with its needs, but publicly bowing down to the US can be very embarrassing to XJinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, researchers say that if Beijing would act wisely, the pressure of the US trade and war may justify China for a long time by reducing the union of both organs.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that would cause economic problems in both countries is more dangerous than the people who have seen it before," says Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the Center for New American Security, a mental institution.
Syria 'is ready for the return of the refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says that she is ready for the return of the refugees and needs help to rebuild a country where war was fought for seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem says that conditions in the world are improving.
"Today the situation is calm and safe because of progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair areas that have been damaged by terrorists to restore normal life.
All the situations now allow for the willing return of refugees to flee the country in which they had to escape because of terrorism and the oppressive economic laws that have plagued their daily lives and life - style.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from this region since the outbreak of war in 2011.
The other 6 million people who still live in this environment need living help.
Al-Moulem has said that the Syrian kingdom can enjoy the help of rebuilding a war - torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept social help or help from countries that support the revolt.
