The members of the AMs Assembly in Wales are concerned about appearing foolish
There are fears of the AMs because it is raised to change the way they are called MWPs (A member of the Wales Parliament).
This has been promoted because there are plans to alter the name of the convention to the Welsh Parliament.
All politicians are concerned that this will cause them to be washed.
One AM of Labour says that his group is concerned that the new pronunciation of the name is close to the terms of "Twp" and "Pwp."
To a student who lives in Wales: Welsh atop is a fool, and a pwp is a fool.
The AM of Wales has said that the whole organization is opposed to this, and has given advice in other terms.
A Conservative member in Wales says that his group has no problem with changing the name, but he has seen that it is easier to call MWP than you call a fool.
In this case the pronunciation of the new letter into Welsh is the same as that of the English letter u.
The Assembly Commission, dedicated to the process of changing the name to the new, said: "The decision of calling the Assembly Members will be adopted by members themselves."
The Management of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh convention permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the community’s responses and found that most agree that the convention has changed to the Parliament of Wales.
In the case of an AMs, the Commission prefers the members of the Wales Parliament or the WMPs, but the people support the MWP.
The AMs is said to suggest otherwise, but the fact that it is difficult to agree on this matter must be a problem for Ellen Jones, the Executive Officer, who is expected to make a change in the weeks ahead.
This policy of change will include other changes, such as how the convention works, including legislation to stop the AMss and how the committee is formed.
The AMs votes that will finally count when the law is discussed in the question of how to call them.
Macedonians will decide to change the name of their country
The votes will vote on Sunday even if they have changed the name of their country to "The Northern Territory of Macedonia."
The vote is intended to settle the dispute over decades with the neighboring Greek province of Macedonia.
The Athenians have long claimed that the name of their north neighbours seems to have their own land, and that they have long opposed their request to be members of the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the change of the name, said that he did not pay the vote.
However, those who support this vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of the name is a value they must bear in order to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s St.
Mr. Adams said: "The older people I spoke to say that there was a club and a church everywhere.
"Today, none of them."
You can understand why the barley was so scarce.
He said: "People will have a different way of life" nowadays.
"Ibar is no longer the neighborhood where people are going.
You are concerned about the churches because you think that the money they earn from selling their products will not last as long as the leaders think, "and they will soon return to their original state."
In addition, churches can be replaced by private flags that will never help to preserve the rest of the community’s sacred sites.
He said: "Many people who buy these plates are white people. So the day will come when the churches will be closed, because it doesn't seem that these people who move to the flags are members of these churches.
Both churches were congregations of white people before Harlem became the blacks, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The first white Methodist congregation came out in the 1930 ’ s.
The nearby black congregation he served became the building one.
St. Martin was a black congregation under the direction of Mr. John Howard Johnson, who led the merchant to 125th Street, the main street on Harlem, which was opposed to the unemployment and the lack of support of black people.
In 19939 the building was badly damaged by fire, but as Tat Johnson' members were preparing to rebuild it, they were ordered to be beaten.
The bull. David Johnson, the son and successor of Tatson in St. Martin's, called the bells's beat, "the bells of the poor."
An expert on metal strike, who struck them, called them another way: "The treasures of culture" and "a historical instrument which will never be replaced."
Tiffany N, of the University of Michigan, also says that it was the first time in the world that this metal instrument was played by a black player, Diosio A. Lind, who moved to the Royal Church of the past 18 years.
Mr. Merweather said that St. Martin's did not replace another person.
The main feature in St. Martin's in the last few months was the role of architects and builders, some of whom were introduced by non - teachers church leaders, others by the Presbyterian Church.
A congregation of parliamentary members, composed of non - teachers in July, is concerned that the majority may not blame the congregation, though it has not contributed to the employment of architects and builders.
Some members complain that the gangsters do not count things.
The shark harms a 13-year-old child to get lobsters in California.
The officers said that they had attacked and injured 13 boys on Saturdays, when they sank to catch a lobster in California on the day of the year's catch.
This attack occurred just before seven mornings near Beacon's Beach in Ecitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help. They then went to the KSWB-TV to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said, at first I thought he was happy to hold a bottlester, but later he realized that he was shouting, ‘ I’m put on! ’
‘ I’m crushed! ’
The bone at the bottom of the throat is all around the chest," Hammel said he was aware of this when he came to the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: 'There is a fish in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in a critical situation.
What kind of shark is left behind is unknown.
The seagull, Kapt. Larry Gilles, said that when speaking on the subject, the shark had been seen there for weeks, but it was not the most dangerous type of shark.
Gilles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The officers have closed the sea from the Pontus Beach at Casablad to Swami's Cunitas for 48 hours to be sure of safety.
Gilles said that there are more than 35 varieties of sharks in the area, but most of them are said to be safe.
Sainsbury's plan to move its products to the UK cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams for stores with skilled people to help people.
As an important way to enter the UK apply industry, which costs as much as £2.8bn, and continues to grow while the fashion and household goods are reduced, these large stores will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country, and will be available in more stores for the coming year if they operate well.
Incessalation of cosmetics is due to the use of empty shelves after the charges against TV, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's will increase the products of the cosmetics you have twice to 3,000, including such names as Revlon, Essie, Tweezman and Dr. Paw Paw Paw first.
Those who already have them like L'Oreal, Mayobelline, and Bart's Bees will have more space to place them in places with names similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
This store will also inform the Boutique productions so that more will be prepared for those who do not eat meat - the - most desperately needed by new buyers.
Also, the Free Shop agent will test the requirements for two Sainsbury's shops, the first opened in Croydon, south London, this past week and the second in Sely Oak, Birmingham, in the course of the year.
Shopping online while people are now buying small amounts of food each day in nearby stores, this requires large stores to do more to encourage people to attend.
Mike Coupe, chief executive officer of the Sainsbury's said, these markets will look like big stores with various products, as they are trying to combat expensive stores such as Aldi and Lidl for more services and other non-food items.
The Sainsbury's has placed where you can buy Argos in many stores and has started with Habitats because it bought them both over the past two years. This has increased the purchase of food and made it profitable.
Efforts to improve both the cosmetic and the medical facilities have collapsed.
The Sainsbury's once tried to meet the Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but they were divided after fighting in a way that divided the medical products in their stores.
This new plan developed after the Sainsbury's sold Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy stores its 281 purchase by £125m, just three years ago.
It says Lloyds will also participate in this plan, by increasing the quality of the quality of the material, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, governor of the Sainsbury's business, said: "We have changed the appearance of the passports with our cosmetics to improve our customers.
We have made money out of the company of our trained professionals so that they can make a living.
The variety of products we have are designed to be prepared for each need, making it easy for us to locate them, is now an interesting place for cosmetics, and that is not the same as the traditional way of buying.
Peter Jones's anger is because Holly Willoughby has given up £11million business
Peter Jones, who is famous in the Dragons Den, traveled 'in the rage' after engineer Holly Willoughby gave up the £11million industry of the product of life in order to cope successfully with the new agreements he has with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their household products and decorations such as Truly.
The business of this couple was compared to the Gwynnetth Paltrow's Goop product.
The pilot of the This Morning program, which is 37, puts it to Instagram that you are leaving.
Holly Willoughby left well known in Dragons" Den, Peter Jones was upset because he came out in the last minute of the production of life - to take good control of his new connections with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones had been a "anger" when an important TV girl agreed to a hot - air meeting at the Marrow headquarters of his Buckinghamshire, in Buckinghamshire, that his new agreements - reaching £1.5 million - give him less time to pay attention to household products and jewelry such as Truly.
This business is likened to the Gwynnetth Palrow's Goop product and has had twice as much money for Wiloughby's estimated £11 million.
As Wiloughby, 37, put in the Instagram if he left Truly, Jones went to one of his own homes on vacation in Britain.
The source says: "Truly was the most important thing to Holly.
It is a term that has been passed on for many decades to come.
The decision to leave her has left an impression on everyone.
No one believed in what happened on Tuesday, close to the celebration of greetings.
There is a store full of items in the Marrow HQ that are convenient for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the reporter of This Morning, among Britain’s major winners, can consume millions of companies for growing large sums of money from fossils and candles to furniture and household goods, and things that may be more timed.
And this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cappp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, who is 51 years old, joined as chairman in March.
The two are on vacation together, and Jones has 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV company.
Willoughby will be the director of this M&S band and will replace Ant McPartlin as the NTV program operator I'm A Celebrity.
A well near Jones has said last, "We will not talk about his business activities."
We said ‘ and we loved each other. ’
She has mocked the criticism that the news has often received by saying something that some consider to be “obscene" and speaking well of a North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a sacrifice?
Trump said in his critical tone of voice "the storyteller."
"I haven't refused."
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting them again after she first met in Singapore in June with Trump as a major step toward nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the nuclear - peace treaty has ceased.
More than three months after the June assembly in Singapore, North Korea’s prime minister Rong Ho told world leaders in the United Nations on Saturday of the Wyso House Law that the North sees no "equal answer" from the United States to Northern Korea by armed forces.
Rather, he said that the United States continues its focus on oppression.
Trump has given hope in a talk he gave to his party.
"We're doing well with North Korea," says the report.
“ We fought with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now get very close.
She said that her efforts to improve her relationship with Kim and with the results of the tests that took place, resulting in the release of people who had been captured and returned to the bones of American soldiers.
And she has protected Kim from something unusual.
"It is very easy to be presidents, rather than 10,000 people on the outside who try to enter the crowded stadium may have about 200 people sitting here," Trump pointed to the crowd standing right before him.
The Indonesian and Nkikimi, destroying the island, and killing hundreds
After the Flood of Lombok, for example, foreign agencies were told that they were not required.
Even though 10 percent of the people of Lombok have been removed from the area, that area has not been declared a disaster zone, which would make it better for the world.
"Hadly, in most cases, they have made it clear that they do not ask for help from the world, so this is a challenge," Mrs.
While Sive the Children include a group going to Palu, it is still not sure whether foreign workers can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Center, said that Indonesian officials examined the situation in Palu to see if the world’s institutions would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
As a result of frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, this country has always been in thest possible way prepared for earthquakes.
While the headhouses of the Aceh are being built, they are rare in some beaches.
The absence of a tsunami alarm in Papua, though warned of this, may have contributed to the deaths.
Even in times of fear, traveling between many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make the journey more difficult.
The hospital ship left Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Wityko set the goal of improving Indonesia’s declining foundations for the development of elections, and he has spent a lot of money working on railways and railways.
But the lack of financial support has plagued Mr. Jogo as it will be renewed in the coming year.
Nevertheless, Mr. Joko is faced with the tension of Indonesian sects, where many Muslim members have entered the main part of the service.
Over 1,000 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their homes as groups of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, spears, and shields, as well as other dangerous weapons.

The number of victims in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the center of the disaster is said to be Sunday morning.
It has been reported that many people are trapped under a 7.5 quake that struck on Friday and caused a wave up to 20 feet, the local speaker Sutopo Pyno Nagroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with dust from fallen buildings.
The police arrested a 32 - year - old man, with charges of murder after a woman was assaulted and died.
A study of homicides began after a woman’s body was discovered in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
This 44 - year - old woman was diagnosed in 7.5am with injuries from Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32- year- old man was arrested for murder.
The police have urged local people who have seen or heard anything before.
The detective Brian O'Hagan said: ‘ Research is still under way, but I urge anyone on John Street's property in Birkenhead to see or ignore anything that makes it hard to contact us.
And I would like to urge anyone, especially the detectives, who may be photographing anything about the dashcam to contact us as possible with important information.'
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman found her body was in Birkenhead and was found in the center of the property.
Relatives who think they know the lady “had come to this mess site to ask questions about the location of the desired site this morning.
Research continues as police have endeavored to identify the closest relatives of the victim.
A member of the Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but has been told by the police that no one is allowed to get out of the building.

Cromwell’s drawing is the last to be found by the debate of ‘ rewritten history.
Its being removed will be the order of the universe because of his desolation, such as the Tababan, in the endless variety of native and religious images of his active Puritan followers.
But Cromwell described Mr Crick's advice as "foolishness" and "to try to rewrite history."
U.S. John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It would be inevitable that in this discussion there is the removal of images if the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The destruction of images in the English wars was neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the written Cromwell will be offered for him because of the actions of his great - grandfather Thomas of the previous century.
The beautiful description of Sir William Hamo Thorneyph is proof of the 19th century's views and of a part of the history of many who no longer think that his life should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more than at the end of the 19th century than now, as a parliamentist against outside oppression, largely in his case the pressure from the imperial power.
Whether this approach is accurate depends on the issue of current history.
The fact is that the conflict between the 17th century has contributed to the development of our country next, and Cromwell is a man who has revealed the same side of the conflict.
What he does as the Chief Protector must be celebrated and remembered.
A Deadly Famine Strikes a Chinese Farm and Killed
A farmer has been attacked by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
A man, described only by his shank "Yian," was found missing with a broken heel, covered with blood near a fish net in the market of Liuppanshui in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post made that report on Sunday.
A pigs farm is preparing to catch his pigs in the hags on May 30, 2005, in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
He is said to have taken his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, discovering that the door to the nearby herd of pigs is open.
He says that there was a large male goat with blood in his mouth.
The study confirmed that the horse weighs up to 550 pounds and wounded the mother, according to the report, killed her.
"The feet of my cousin were blood and twisted," said the cousin whose name is "Wu," as quoted by Guitong Evening News.
The security cameras showed Yuan entering the market by 4.40 am on Thursday for feeding pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The bear did not depart from Jehu or his nephew.
The manager of the market told Evening News that the horse had been locked up to prevent other people from attacking, while the police collected evidence in the swamp area.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are said to talk about the rewards of her death.
Although rare, the situation in which pigs are recorded is similar to one that once attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a man with her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and a man was seriously injured.
In the last ten years, a 150-inch male caught a Welsh farmer in a trekhthari until his wife chased him away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one of Manitoba farms told the CBC News that the pigs did not feel aggressive but that their eating of blood could cause this.
It’s not just fun.
They are nails, very protective... they have no intention of harming you.
You need to give yourself the right, the word.
Hurricane Rosa's Frognent Frames bring widespread rainfall to the southwestern part of the U.S.
As an estimate of the weather, Hercan Rosa fails as she dives into calm waters on the north coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa has 85 mph winds, The Cathegori 1 Hurricane, from 5 a.m in the Western Hemisphere on Sunday, and lived at 385 miles to the southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel westward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the tough begins to take shape in the Pacific Ocean and move east along the western coast of the U.S.
Rosa will bring ten inches of rain to Mexico's areas on Mondays.
After that, the hydropic climate that cooperates with the rise of the tough will create an abundance of rainfall in the Southern Hemisphere in the days to come.
As far as home, 1 / 4 inches of rain will cause serious flooding, the flow of frames, and the volume of land in the desert.
In the case of home wet - gas emissions will cause rainfall rates of from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in southern parts of Navada and Arizona.
Although it is expected that 2 to 4 inches of rain in the Southwest areas, especially on the side of Arizona.
The sound of the flow of flooding waters is fast taking place in the conditions of tropical rain.
It will be the best advice to try to walk in the wilderness with the fear of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to become mighty rivers and thunders to bring in destructive winds in the vicinity and there will be dust.
Its arrival will bring some severe rainfall to some of the coastal areas of the Southern California.
The total rainfall that will be experienced will be more than half an inch, which can cause small hydrofoil frames and cause a slip in the roads.
The rain will be the first rain in this area in the wet autumn.
Some short - term tropical rains will first take place in Arizona on Monday evening, before the rains are everywhere on Monday evening and Tuesday evening.
The heavy rain will spread to the Four corners by Tuesday and drop by Third.
By October we can see some of the anxiety in the U.S. temperature as the Arctic can find cool, but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this affects a dramatic change of heat over a short distance.
There is a good example of the different types of heat in the U.S. temperature during Sunday.
About 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Monies, Iowa.
In the last few days, summer heat is trying to build up and increase.
It is expected that there will be a rise in the temperature of the Western Hemisphere and a total of 80 from the South to the Northern Hemisphere.
New York City can reach 80 degrees a second, resulting in an estimated 10 degrees above normal size.
Our estimate of the weather climate for a long period of time reflects the high temperatures of the upper temperature in the eastern part of the U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched Kavanagh Brett's advice.
More than 20 million people who had seen the evidence for the body’s fourth testimony were made by High Court choice Brett Kavanaug and his sex - molester in the 1980 ’ s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political situation continues, with a distribution that interferes with the development of the fifth session to change at the last minute: an accord made by the Arizona Sen by Jeff Flavie so that the FBI could conduct a one-week investigation in the trial.
Ford told the Senate Management Committee that he was sure 100 percent that Kavanaug had put his finger on the influence of alcohol and even tried to free him from a high school party.
Kavanaough, in the evidence of body movement, said to be 100 percent sure that this never happened.
It is not unusual that more than 20.4 million people had seen Nelson's report in Hulanu.
The company counted the number of followers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Statistics did not appear at this moment to be visible to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has a limited number of models that have been observed in office.
To put it in this case, it is the same amount of followers and when the finals are observed in soccer game played or in the Education Services.
The DO of the Board of the States, whose opinion is to have a system supporting the election of Kavanaugough, led all the other networks with a ratio of 5.69 million users during the period of roll throughout the day, says Nielsen.
The ABC was in the second place with a total of 3.26 million observers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC was 2,994 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million and CNN had 22.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remains high after counsel.
Folake was the first person to be watched in the Hulanu drama
After the Central Regional Office issued an appeal for Kavanaugough vote, it was obtained by the CNN and CBS representatives on the Friday morning by the protesters as they try to climb the fratrica for the counsel of the Executive Committee.
He has stood in shock for several minutes as he criticized him, which he was speaking about this time on CNN TV.
"I am standing here before you," said the man of naughty.
"Do you think you speak the truth in the country?
He was told, "He is powerful when the majority of the fools are weak."
Folake said that her office issued a statement and that, before closing the draft, she had more to say on the committee of counsel.
The distribution and distribution network were all broadcast at the same time for the next hour, while the Executive Committee was to vote for the development of Kavanagh in full votes.
But Folake said that she would do so only by consulting the FBI where she would be going to look at the charges against the choice in the coming week, where the Democratics were a few groups advised.
Folake advised that she should speak to her relative, The Democratic DO, Chris Coos.
After talking to Coons and other satellites afterward, Flake has made a decision.
The Franks's choice is powerful, for there is evidence that the Libyans would not vote to accept Capernaum without doing research.
President Trump opened an investigation of the FBI to investigate the charges laid by Kavanaug.
The British PM of May proposes ‘ political play ’ more than Brexit.

Livingstone, in the meantime, relates the extent of his failure in this section to six games, where the principal instructor Holt was to play the victory that he had replaced Kenny Miller this past month.
Livingstone missed opportunities for unauthorized visitors
The Holt team should have led even before putting the notes in it, by direct travel that makes Ringers have all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson has highlighted your efforts by looking at the article, Alan Lithgow can say that his efforts are not to be made by later intervention
Hotels were happy to see Rangers playing in front of them, knowing that this would have been a problem for the visitors.
And that is the way an important article comes.
The Ringers have accepted the free kick and Livingstone also worked with the opening, Declan Galagher and Robinson joined together by laying Menga, which has touched the ball to put an article from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Ringers had the best opportunity to hold the ball, but they found that the diamond was solid and that the stick Liam Kelly had no problem.
The fur has continued in the second half, although Alfred Morelos forced the bridge from Kelly to close.
Scott Pittman has been placed on the foot of Allan McGregor, a Ringers' assistant and Lithgow who has dropped a football ball from a Livingstone player.
The cross balls have continued to come to the Livingstone's brake and continued to be explained, while there were two pencils-after-avices by Halket's in the position of Glen Middleton, one being the handball-ben.

Playing with a marvelous deck and Livingstone's results.
In man's eyes, they continued to focus on all that had been expected in this cast way.
Their method of play and control has not usually changed as they have returned with a standard aircraft, but the honor is accorded the Holt by the way he played the team game he has arrived.
He had many powerful men.
The captain of the crew Halket had a hull, which hosts the Supebly-efefe, while Menge kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worral always in small sizes.
Ringers needed encouragement.
Although they had played very well on occasion under the Gerrad, they fell less than the decks.
Their last ball was just the one to which they had provided home's garden open and that was a surprise to the Rangers, which they found to be at the center of the table.

The tsunami follows 7.5 .5 .m.
"While the tsunami was promising yesterday, people were doing their work at sea and didn't run off immediately and then run off as victims," Sutopo Pyo Nya Nagroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Minister for the NTPB Service, spoke as he gave comments to Jakarta.
"The tsunami has never traveled alone, hauling cars, blocks, houses, hauling everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was going by the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (47 mph) before it reaches the shore.

These commissions come after various sections of the U.S. government have made AI declarations, and such as the U.S.

Trump’s stable in West Virginia
The President refers not to the situation directly around his choice of the High Court Brett Kavanough when he spoke about the importance of the departure of the Republicans to vote with the medieval choice.
"All we have done can lose it in November.
Five weeks remain before the historic election, which is of vital importance to our time.
This great election, great, is "I'm not running, and I'm not running, that I am everywhere striving to find deserving persons," says the report.
“ When you see bad things, the bad things of the Democratic group, you see them occurring at the same time, ” continues Trump.
And he is willing to take over the power of the government by whatever means he sees fit, cruelty, lack of compassion.
They don't care who hurt them, who will go before him to get power and authority, and only what they need in the power to control it, will we not give them.
The Democratics, he said, are in the old machines on a mission to "re-constitute and interfere."
"And you have seen what is happening in the last four days," says the Democrats, "because you are angry and insensitive and unfair."
He referred to the Senate’s State Administration Committee on the level of Sen of Democraticus Dianne Feinstein, where he has received protests from observers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you pushed a dot?
Uh, oh, what.
No, no, I expected another – it was a bad idea of body language such as I didn't see it.
Labour is divided into two parts.
It is not easy to talk to those who have spoken what they think
When the Momentum's accusatorys in my local group decided to disagree with me, it was strange.
After all that, I am the senior member of the Labour Pys list to be told that she should not be asked what they are all saying.
My partner in parliament received the same kind of treatment from Joan Ryan, who stood firm and opposed the Jews.
In my case, I was the victim of criticism and opposition from Jeremy Corbyn.
In the important police of the operating economic system, for the security of the country, Europe, by signing similar issues where Jeremy does not agree with previous leaders.
The notice of the conference Nottingham East Lauu wrote that "We want the meetings to be included and have the appropriate results."
For nearly eight years I am the MP of Labour in the community, the night GC sessions of Hulanu were just right.
Whereever it is today, this modern meeting is not a feature of the meetings that usually have "human and soft, lower" politics are running off, so it can start again.
It seems a growing trend for differences of opinion that differing views are not accepted in the Labour group and all ideas are examined before being accepted by the advice group.
This begins after Jeremy’s entry into the administrative chair, such as a workmate and former party with an idea of sharing a similar political opinion with him and being expected to change it quickly and take places that I did not agree to.
Whenever I speak out, and what I don't care about is after the harassment on the communications pages is said to be dropped to the seat, not to be accepted by the local politicians, I am told that I should not be in the Labour group.
And that is my experience.
Thus, I know that I am more fortunate than my fellow workers as the commissions are brought directly to me tend to be political.
I respect the art and determination of my workmates who are facing sexual or racial abuse every day but who can’t push it away.
One of the most disturbing features of this conflict and of politics is the way that violent and often violent measures are common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour group had adopted the tradition of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer the great church and in a state of "security" or to change the principles of the group they have become vulnerable.
I have many advice in the past two years, asking me to yield, not to speak as I speak, and then "All is fine."
But this is not what I will do in politics.
So when I joined Labour in 32 years as a schoolboy, don't be concerned with being stirred up by the Tatcher government to ignore the room where I was studying, since I vowed that I would fight for the best public and needed services, especially if I was a planning or government minister.
I did not hide my involvement in politics, including this past revolution.
No one in the East of Nottingham would be confused by any way about my station at my police station, and in places where I do not agree with the leaders of the present time.
In these conditions now promoted by Friday, I can say that in all cases when Brexit influences injury in homes, businesses, and our public services, I don't understand his desire to spend time and strength in my loyalty to the leader of the Laur group.
The truth is that the one message I have is not going to go to my people, whether they are members of Labour or their families: I’m proud of working under you and promise that no amount of sacrifice or political help can keep me from doing what I believe is your greatest needs.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is ahead
The next two tries point to the end of the point which almost leads to the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr is worthy of such a fine victory for the celebration of the Tennant's Premiership day's festival.
Now they are increasing, the most isolated area.
In the end, it was their high-decked protection, and their opportunity to take a better opportunity, which led to the deterioration of the domestic case and of the trainer Peter Murchiie.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we have not yet been beaten, therefore I should be happy," you said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: "Huning Ayr, they do better than we did."
Grant Anderson in his 14 minutes, which was changed by Fizzier Climo, and put Ayr in front, but, a Scottish Cap card with Rory Hughes, got off the game by the Warriors, allow Melrose to make the balloons free and Jason Bagot to take them on unchangeably.
Clymo extended Ayr's leadership leadership by Penalty, before, half-time of the game, he added an article and then changed the design to 17-5 in Ayr at rest.
But Melrose has started half well, and Patrick Anderson's tract, which was changed by Baggot, reduced the opportunity for five points.
It has been said that it has been a long time for Mariadh Knott, who has been released with stress, and when Ayr’s new invention has increased rapidly with Stafford McDowall, translated by Climo.
A member of the Ayr captain Blair Macpherson has been given a black card, and again, Melrose has paid a man with the untraned Bruce Colinnie’s wheel, under intense pressure.
However, it was returned home and when Struan Hutchinson was given a black card because of hanging Climo without a ball without apenalti line, MacPlerson went to bed after he was struck by Ayr.
Climo has changed, as almost from the start again, after Kyle Rowe had assembled David Armstrong’s balls together in a box and sent the Frenchman Gregor Henry far away by putting a fifth wheel.
The Still Game sample appears to be committed to a new job in the section of the
The Still Game editorial by Ford Kieran seems determined in the reception area after it has been found that he has been appointed to be the director of the licensed state company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a famous BBC exhibition, writing it with another expert looking at the humor of Greg Hemphill.
The two have already explained that the next nine turn will be the last in the presentation and that Kernan is apparently planning to do something else after Craig.
According to a series of oral reports, he is the ruler of the Adrifton Limited.
The player has not wanted to note this article, although a Scottish Sun source has said that Kernan wants to enter the "existing business" in Glasgow.
'Our Sea: Bolivia buried in the world hope that the path will open the way to the Pacific
The sailors watched over the masts of the capital in La Paz.
Publicly fines signal the blue flag.
The navy's bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the words: "The sea is ours legally.
Once again we get it from our work.
Throughout the world’s state of Bolivia, memories of the sea shore taken by Chile in a war of mass bloodshed in the 19th century are just as vivid as the desire to return to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably very high for centuries, as Bolivia awaits the trial of the world law court on October 1 after five years of debate.
“ Bolivia has power, a spirit of unity and calm, and it waits calmly for the results, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian ambassador.
Most citizens of Bolivia will listen to the sentence of the World Law Court on large stations throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand on the Bolivian ground every decade of the debate and then back to Chile that it is forced to consider grant Bolivia a fair seaway.
Evo Morales, a surviving president of Bolivia and a native - born - up to the difficult battle to be chosen again next year - old, has much to do with the Monday’s judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," confirm it toward the end of August.
But some social analysts say that the court in Bolivia will rarely change the situation so much.
The United Nations Committee established in the Netherlands has the power to rid Chile of the land, and it has stated that it cannot know the results of speech that can exist.
The fact that the judgment of the Universal Court was issued only six months after the discussion suggests that the case was “free, ” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on the law of the land.
And instead of responding to Bolivia’s demands, for four years he may have returned it.
"The extent of sea landing has been seized by the existing government of Bolivia," says Zárate.
Morally speaking, too, has brought to an end any kindness that still existed in Chile, as noted.
Bolivia and Chile will talk again one day, but it will be difficult to catch up with them after this.
The two countries have not had much in common with executives since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, an attorney from Bolivia in The Hague, has ruled that the court has taken an unusual move.
Monday will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to open up on a new sheet of cooperation with Chile" and the opportunity to "put an end to 134 years of disagreement in terms of benefits," says the report.
Calzadilla has also rejected the fact that Morals - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - using this sea scene as a political party.
" Bolivia will never relinquish its right to the Pacific Ocean," he says.
"This sentence is an opportunity to see if we need to conquer things that happened in the past."
North Korea says that it will not dispose of nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
In North Korea, says R Yong Ho, his country will not break up with its nuclear weapons if he does not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday in the United Nations Legal Department.
He asked the United States to follow up promises made during the Singapore conference among eye - controlled leaders.
This is what is said when State seat Mike Pompio seems to start a conversation that was already under way for more than three months after that in Singapore and Kim Yong One in North Korea.
RI says that “it's a ‘ myth' that the continuing and denial of the United States's declaration to end the Korean War will make the Northern War give up.
Washington is careful to agree to the agreement before Pyonggo takes steps to break off the weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted the second conference.
But many doubt that Pyonggo is willing to give up the weapons that the country considers to be the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompio plans to visit Pyonggo the next month to arrange for Kim and Trump to attend.
Paris fashion displays show various recent hats you will see on the streets of a nearby town
If you want to enlarge the hats you have or if you want to have the sun so that you don’t go somewhere else.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne have begun to make a series of the most unusual of the SS hats that have fallen alongside the deck set up on the Paris Model.
These amazing hats have spread to Instagram in this summer and these designers have sent their frightening hats to the exhibition.
Valentino's single hat is a wide haze covered with the whole head of the cargo overseer.
Some extremely large hats included valves, earrings, and even pannakes, but they were not designed to warm your head.
Tom Browne, on the other hand, brought with him a series of impressive oaks at the same time as the Norwegians.
Many of these colorful masks have beaks and are much like Hannibal Lecter rather than fashion.
One helmet would be to enter the water with a towel, while the other was like a melted ice cup.
And if you like the latest fashion, you are fortunate.
Fadmakers say that these hats may also come where you live.
These prominent hats are on the steps of the 'LaBamba', a two-footed sun hat, worn by people like Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The label that made these unusual hats filling the connections has come with another large item that was shown by a straw bag carried on the beach that is almost as big as a complete laundryman in your hand.
The Raffia bag in oranges, with the upper end of a rose with a white purple blade, was the head of the Jacquemus's collection of La Riviera SS19 in the Paris Fake.
The famous designer Luke Army told FEMAIL: ‘ I expect to see large hats and sea bags coming to the people in the following summer - as the truckers have been torn away will be hard to ignore the people who have been interested in these big things.'
John Edward: Language skills that are important to people of the world
The Scottish independent schools have a high record of academic achievement, and this has continued in 2018 and other long - standing tests, which are strengthened by individuals and group success in sports, art, music, and other public endeavors.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), try to offer a high level of service to their students and parents.
Self - discipline schools try to prepare their students for higher education, for larger education, and for a better secular education, as well as for the environment in which they live.
As an educational field that can create and employ an appropriate school album, we see existing languages continuing as a preferred and required course of study in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: ‘ If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his mind.
If you speak with him in his language, he approaches his help.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend on English for companionship and trust among foreigners.
From the recent results of the test, we can see that languages are high in the standard of distribution in private schools.
Nearly 68 percent of foreign students have received notes in Higher District A.
A well - compiled report, in 474 schools of ScIS, shows that 72 percent of the students received Hugher de A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of French students and 36 percent of Spanish students received A.
This indicates that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills for children and young people who want to be sure of the future.
Now languages, as a preferred subject, are similarly valued as studies of StEM (science, technology, meering and maths) in the complex of private schools and others.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Development and Skills in 2014 found that in the reasons given by employers for the problem of frequently flooding on the job, 17 percent are associated with a lack of language skills.
Hence, more and more language skills become necessary in preparing young people for future tasks.
As more and more workplaces demand language, these skills are vital in a cooperative world.
Whatever assignment a person chooses, if he learns a new language, he will have more time to develop such skills as that one.
Being able to communicate directly with people of other nations has opened up opportunities for a person to become fluent in many languages.
According to the test of the YouGov for the 4,000 seniors of the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak another language well enough to communicate and only French to speak more than 15 percent, 15 percent.
That is why raising funds for the growing language is now important for children.
Knowing many languages, especially those of the developing world, will equip children with excellent opportunities to get a good job.
In Scotland, each school will vary in language.
Several schools will focus on the current languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be of major importance in the UK in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child likes, there will always be a number of different languages to choose from in private schools, and there are also teachers who are skilled in this section.
Private Scots are eager to prepare a teaching environment that will prepare children to be equipped with the skills needed to succeed, wherever they may be in the future.
There is no denying now, in the world’s business system, that languages continue to be important to the future of this world, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be viewed as "the ability to communicate with the world."
Free schools will continue to offer this choice, separation and back to young people in Scotland.

Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump introduces his violent gathering this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five conventions that Trump planned this coming week, including visiting friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the certificate vote is still established until he chooses to take his place in the High Court, Trump tries to undermine the support of the second election since the Republics are at risk of losing Congress ’ control in favor of Nov.
When will Trump, West Virginia, meet this evening, and how should you view it online?
Trump's convention of Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled 7 p.m.T. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump Virginia's West Virginia conference on the Internet with the trimu in You Tube.
Trump is expected to speak at this week’s meeting of the Supreme Court winner Brett Kavanough, in a difficult situation because of charges of sexual misconduct, it is expected that a check mark will be established for a week while the FBI will investigate.
But the main goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to cope with November’s election.
Thus, a five - week project by President Trump has been aimed at "the strength of the volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase their numbers in the legislature and the Bills House," says Reuters.
"To control Congress is so important to him that the president will go to so many countries as we approach the busy freeboard," the Tump's undecided representative to tell him what Reuters had said.
Listed at Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, this modern example can extend support from "Ohio and Pensylvania" and is also known in Pittsburgh for its subject," says West Virginia City News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state division has won by 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help the Republican Republic of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who walks behind this election.
“ It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to his defense, ” says Simon Header, a Protestant scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The Ryder Cup 2018: American team shows that if you are hungry for success, you will continue to fight as one who looks forward to going to people’s games on Sunday.
After three games a person plays alone, playing as a first of four is what the Ryder Cur needed.
The position of advancement in any group has given rise to the idea of sports in which players believe, and the same competition.
In this way, who may be the head of the corner?
"Give them six points and are now four, so I think we're going ahead," says Jordan Spieth, while she is walking for the day.
Europe has taken this opportunity, in fact, four points above and another 12 still not yet confirmed.
The Americans, as said by Spieth, feel that they are well running and that there are many to be interested in, including how Spieth and Justin played well all day, and the couple have three to four points.
Spieth has been playing well since the beginning and paid for example.
When people shout a bit of joy at him, he puts the ball in the right time to win the game after he and Thomas were beaten with two points.
Pulling a ball into a ball to win a game by 15 makes people cry the same way, telling you that the American team is not losing.
"You have to be concerned about your game at all," says Spieth.
They left that behind.
18 holes to identify them.
The top - scorers in the Spieth and Thomas two days ago were Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleet, an unprovable Ryder Cup story
Europe’s roads contribute to strange and harmless couples.
"The two "Moliwood" is the most non-bogey on Saturdays and Saturdays, Friday afternoons and Back Winnes on Friday morning.
Such cooperation, along with their interest in the crowds, seems to be as attractive to the crowd as they must be to the church’s father, and no other well - known player can win Europe at the end of the day at Golf National instead of Feetwood and the Molinari.
It is best to play both together at the same time in different locations.
To speak of Europe’s success is not apparent, however
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did the work of Sergio Garcia, a champion of four footballs in the morning, when he got partners with Alex Nore.
The Bogey and the other two two shorts with a Spanish hole in which they could not get out.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of that hole.
Four balls and four players are happy to watch them close by side as a result of cooperation, advice they offer, counsel they do not offer, and how the program can change in just a matter of time.
Europe has played better as a band until now and is leading to the last day, but four players have shown that the American team is searching for a questionable cure if possible, particularly the Stateside.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cur
Europe will take the lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup after four points and four games have made them pay 10-6 to America.
It is interesting to both Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary to change the game to overcome the poor Tiger Woods to make progress in the Golf National Union in four points.
The case of Thomas Bjorn of Europe, wanting to conquer the rod that defeated them in Hazeltine two years ago, defeated the American morning side with four points, winning a series of games in 311.
America did not readily agree with four sports, winning two games, although it could not really cover that debt.
Jim Furyk’s case requires eight scores in 12 individual sports for the performance
Fleetwood was the first European to take four points and then to be new at the same time with Mlinari, they were called "Molliwood" after the weekend of the first two seconds to win the four points at the opening of the Ryder Cup.
By striking Woods and Patrick Reed on four balls, they passed the winner of Woodsn and the American colony, British Brisin Dechambaau in 5 and 4.
Woods, who has been drawn to two Saturdays, showed there and then showed interest but divided 19 of the 19 games he played in four footballs and four players in a row
Justin Rose rested in the morning with his partner Henrik Stenson in 21 and 1 in whom Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka the world over
Europe lost much of its influence in France.
Jordan Spieth, father of three fathers, and Justin Thomas did the best for Americans to receive two articles on Saturday.
They received a victory in 2 to 1 when they played with the Spanish Jon Rahm and the Ian Paulter of the sourbaals again separated Pulter and Rory McIlroy on 4 and 3 of the motors divided into two opening holes.
Twice in the Ryder Cup a group goes from four points to individual games, although Foryk’s side requires playing in a way that no one can win.
After two days, the attack on the Church protects them from further attack.
The North Korea says that ‘ it will never complete its equipment before it is secured.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that these terms made it impossible for America to be trusted and that America could complete her Nuclear weapons if she could obtain security certificates.
RI Yong Ho has told the board of the audience to take positive steps last year, such as stopping the testing of weapons and the disposal of Nucler's facilities, and making a promise that we can no longer make Nucler weapons.
However, we don't see any parallel steps from America," says the report.
"When there is no promise from America, there will be no hope for the security of our country, and in this case we will never throw our weapons away without speaking to America.
While Ri recognising what is commonly said by North Korea about North Korea’s refusal to complete the Nuclear weapons in terms below which North Korea is rewarded for the small steps it took, her report did not deny what Pyong was done to complete the illegitimacy.
R Ri told of a joint report published by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the president of the United States and the governor of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for "complete Nuclear weapons instead of Korea" at the time Trump promised the security of Korea.
North Korea wanted to end the Korean War of 1950-53 justly, but America said that Pyyyang should put an end to Nuclear weapons first.
Wahington’s appeal to reduce the severity of the trials of countries bordering North Korea is rare.
"Americans enforce the "ending of Nuclear armaments first" and increase the degree of pressure by penalties to carry out their purpose in a forced manner, against the declarations of the end of war," says R.
‘ The idea that judges can shock us is a false dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that these terms increase distrust.
RI did not discuss the plans of one Kim conference and Trump, which the American leader spoke before the United Nations this week.
Instead, the mayor spoke of three meetings between Kim and the South Korean governor Mon Jae-in and added: "If a group in the case of Nuclear is South Korea and not America, would it be possible to complete the Nuclear weapons instead of Korea.
However, Ri's speech seems quite different from the previous year, when he spoke with the U.N. General Assembly that the target of North Korea's flying devices in the United States was inevitable after the U.S. President's evil President Trump called Kim "as a suicideer" who wanted to kill himself.
In this year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "finally destroy" North Korea, has boldly given Kim praise by taking action to complete the weapons, but this means that it has much greater work and that the trials will remain far away from North Korea and the Nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump spoke of having no set time then, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang with the steps he took.
Even so, American secretary Mike Pompio told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The extension of the Security Council's sentences will not continue very hard until we see the complete completion of Nuclear weapons.
The Security Council has issued terms in North Korea since 2006 for the purpose of eliminating Nuclear’s flying Pyyang operations.
Pompio has met R across the U.N. General Assembly and said that he would visit Pyoyang again for the second conference.
Pompio has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not turned out well.
He left Pyoyang in July and said that there was an advance made, but North Korea claimed that he made "needs like those made by robbers."
The North Korea promised to meet Moon this month so that they could break up the Nuclear flying devices if America's actions were "contained."
Kim told her that the "contractive action" which Trump promised in Singapore and the progress in common relations with Washington
The Harvard students took a course to get sufficient rest
A new study at Harvard University this year made all premeditated students sleep sufficient for the purpose of combating all night-wise learning habits using caffeine.'
One expert has found that students at a high university are ignorant of the principles of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep therapist at Harvard Medical School and an expert in the Brigham and Women's hospital, held this study, believing that it was the first of this type in America.
He was encouraged by his talk about the consequences of not getting enough sleep for the study.
'When she finished one class of her class, one girl came up to me and said: ‘ Why am I told that now, I’m going to finish school?'
He said that no one told me the importance of sleep that surprised me, telling The Telegraph.
This study was started this year, explaining the benefits of sleep regarding the development of education and sports, as well as improving the health of the general community.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and the director of university medical services, said that the university decided to bring this lesson to the end after finding students who are not enough to sleep.
This one - hour study involves a series of interesting activities.
In one section there is a picture of a university bedroom, where students click coffee cups, curtains, training clothes and literature for the purpose of explaining the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects the development of sports.
In one section, participants were told how lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The school map, with its appealing qualities, encourages the participants to think about their day - to - day activities.
We know that it will never change the behavior of the disciples immediately.
Still, we believe that they have a right to know — as you have the right to know the health consequences of smoking the grave, says educator Czeisler.
The habit of not wanting to sleep is still present, which says, adding that modern technology and pressure on students that prevent them from falling asleep is a growing problem.
To ensure sufficient sleep should be an unknown means of coping with stress, fatigue, and anxiety, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep problems the brain, keeping it hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old who lives in California who studies chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler make a study of the class, after attending his first class in Harvard in his first year.
He says that the class opened his eyes and made him interested in making this class available throughout the school.
You hope that the next step is to ask the responsible students to do the same reading before entering the competition center.
The instructor Czeisler advises students to think that they have a wake, as well as a wake, and to be aware of the harmful effects of electrical light and LEDs, which can interfere with the daily routine routines, which can lead to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1-0 Rranges Menga of Gerrard's men in one article
The Ringers also had a problem while playing while Dolly Menga called Steven Gerrad on one point at an egg (0) in Livingstone.
The role of the Ibrox was interested in carving is the first time the St Johnstone struck on 41 in February. But the Gary Holt's team struck Gerard the second time in the 18th game, which began to be the commander as he lost eight points in the front of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga received an article in the last few minutes ahead of the haf-time and the Rangers' players were not interested.
While the Ringers came down instead of the 6th, the Livingstone rose to the third after it was the Hibernian left with one article.
And there are problems that come to the Ringers after the linnersman Calum Spence has been treated to his head after he has been hit by a cast from the side of the players who have left.
Garrard has changed the late-translator Ayr to the last game of Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt continues with 11 similar Livingstone players who took one point from the Hearts last week and rejoiced at the way his team beats its opponents in every way.
The Ringers controlled the game, but Livingstone did more when getting the ball.
It should have struck the article for the second minutes when Menga’s player let Scott Pittman pass to the devices of Allan McGregor but the middle player didn't find it.
Keaghan Jacobs rejected Craig Halket’s soccer team, but his partner, Alan Lithgow, was able to open wide on the back pads.
The Ringers did not get a rule but seemed more optimistic than belief about the third game before the last one.
Alredo Morelos feels that he should have received a pencil in half an hour's notice as he and Steve Lawlets clash but Steve Thomson ignored the complaints of the Colombian performer.
The Ringers had the opportunity to turn the ball away before the first stage of the game, but the Ibrrox player Liam Kelly had no problem with the head football player of Lasshana Colulibaly and the Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingstone received the first article in 34 minutes that it has been difficult to find, no one can deny that it is truly worthy of them without any effort at all.
Rangers also failed to prevent the ball that Jacobs had won.
Scott Arfield did not act like Declan Galagher who handed a ball to Scott Robinson, who had no worry about bringing it to Menga.
Garrard made the change early as Coulibaly transferred the change to Ryan Kent, resulting in a sudden turnaround as the athlete opened the door to Morelos, but the star star ran off.
But the Livingston continues to make the team on the move to play what he wants, and Lithgow and Halket were also playing ball far away again.
The Holt team could find an article at the start of the game, but McGregor was even firm in denying Jacobs before Lithgow had put it on the prows.
One of the previous Ringers contestants, Glenn Middleton, had another case as he faced Jacobs, but they did not pay attention to Thomson too.
Almanac: Gardener Couter
And now pages from "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, over 136 years ago, and SUNDAY... scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geigger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of monitoring and monitoring radiation, which was produced by the development of a device known as the General Couter.
Since then, the Gezer Court has also been used in pop culture as well, as shown in a video presentation in 1950 known as "Bels of Corondao," whose extremely interested players are scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘ What is that? ’
Rogers: “It is the Geiger Court, used to look for precious gems.
When you put these things in your ears, you will hear the effects of Atoms released by radiation.
Evans: "Speak, it does appear now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, after a few days of his birthday of 363.
But this sign bearing his name will keep on living.

Although not distributed, the West video is displayed in chat rooms by ridiculers Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock was trying to laugh at West with this video.
On the other hand, West is angry with observers because he faces difficulty before he enters his hat.
"They used me back.
They said to me, ‘ Don't go in with the hat you carry.'
They abused me!
And they said I was in the lowest place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "Do you want to see the depth of the ground?" which means to wear "superman’s garment, because it means what I want to do. Do you want the world to continue?
Try showing love.
His talks have not been given the support of observers and the staff of the SNL, says Valerie, and another person saying: "All radios are silent."
West is brought to the place of Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend died, rap singer Mac Miller a few days ago.
West has puzzled many by singing the song I Love It, which bears her like Perier Bottle.
West has received support from the head of the TPUSA security group, Condance Turner, who wrote in Twitter: "I speak to a very brave person: TO BEARING."
And the program manager Karen Hunter wrote in Twitter that the West just "had behaved as if he really didn't exist and was a surprise."
"But I have decided not to pay a person (by buying his music or giving him support for his " his skill") that I believe he accepts and releases harmful ideas from my society.
You are free.
So, too, he said he could add.
Prior to the program, this rap performer informed his followers to Twitter that he had changed his name justly, saying that he was known as the "Sone West in justice now."
He is not the first singer to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rap partner, Snap Dogg, has changed his name to Snap Lion and the late singer of Prince who changed his name to sign.

The highlight of the Golden Age of Thrones Kit Harrington speaks of trying to be a man in a dangerous way
Kit Harrington is known for holding a sword as he imitates Jon Snow in an old HBO film, the Game of Thrones.
But this 31 - year - old researcher has spoken against what many people believe about this powerful hero, saying that such roles make young men feel that they have to show themselves strong enough to win respect.
Speaking on the Sunday Times culture, Kit said that he believed that ‘ something went wrong ’ and wondered how this problem could be dealt with by trying to be a man in a dangerous way at the time of #Me Too
Kit, who is married to a prominent partner in the Time of Threes, also 31 years old, admits that he is “hard to deal with. ”
‘ I have a hard time, according to my own part, where have we not gone well with the man?,' he said.
‘ What have we taught men as they grew up, about the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television is responsible for the problem of trying to be a dangerous man because of its male counterparts.
He added: ‘ What are they taught?
What is taught on television, on the streets, that boys think it’s all right to become men?
How do I think that this is the most important question in our modern era?
For there is obviously something wrong with our boys.
In this discussion he even agreed to never again to play the movie when it comes to the next type, saying that he is ‘ finished with the wars and the horses.
Since November Kit will be the target of a remonstratory film called Sam Sherard's True West of the story of the father of the showmaster and his brother, a thief.
He believes that meeting Rose is the best thing that has ever happened to her in the Time of Thrones.
‘ I have met my wife in this way, and thus have helped me to find my family and my life since now,' he said.
Rose had followed the example of Ygritte, who had been in love with Jon Snow, whom Kit had been imitating this self - sacrificing film that won a large contest.
The couple were married in June 2018 in the home of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new patients
China has reported an increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to medical authorities.
An estimated 44,000 people who live with the disease are affected in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
More often than not, people are affected by this sexually transmitted disease.
Naturally, most of the people in China are affected by blood transfusions.
But the proportion of people affected in this way was completely lost, and the Chinese medical authorities said so at a meeting of the Yunnan canon.
Every year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a real problem for the people of the KGB in China.
Homosexuality is no longer prevalent in China since 1997, but discrimination against the people of the KGB is said to be difficult.
Because the country has such a negative view, research has revealed that 70% of the men and 70-90% of the men are going to marry people in the same area.
Most of the time the effects are created are not sufficiently safe in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised the access to HIV drugs as part of the problem.
Maxine Waters rejected the information about the ILOP network issued by an employee who is not legally available, resulted in ‘ a misdemeanor' and ‘ non-interactive's. ’
American representative Maxine Waters said on Saturday the charges that one of his employees put personal information on the public relations of the Republican Eden in Wikipedia.
The Democratic Republic of Los Angeles has suggested that these charges are announced by experts and their sides.
"A lie, lies and lots of lies," says Waterers in a report to Twetter.
According to reports released home addresses and telephone numbers of these Americans. Lindsey Graham of southern Carolina, and Mike Lee included Orrin Hatch, Utah.
These notes appear on the Internet on Thursday, included by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during the council talks about the inaction and charges of not treating the justice of the High Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
These scraps were released after a period of time, with questions sent to Kavanaug.
The wise Web sites such as the Gateway Pundit and RedSate have reported that the IP addresss indicate that the source of information is from the Waters Office" and even issued the observations of Waters employee, says The Hill.
"These groundless accusations are absolutely false," adding Waters.
"A member of my work-hands who is at risk because its personal details have been removed because of these false charges that are not available - responsible for the discharge of these wastes.
This groundless charge is absolutely false.
Waters report has received a quick criticism on the Internet, including the former office secretary of the U.S. President Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is anger," writes Fleischer.
"This indicates that he does not have a degree of membership in the Congress.
When a person is falsely accused of a wrong he has done, he is not obligated to take offense.
He does not have to struggle.
He does not have to ask the accuser’s intentions.
It is necessary to calm down and relax.
Fleischer would have compared Waters ’ reply with the criticism of the Democratics of Judge Kavanaug, accused of being so angry with the Fourth bullring.
Omar Navarro, the Republican branches that had entered the election to release Waters during the year, also expressed his opinion to Twitter.
"Great matters when true," he wrote to Twitter.
In his noise, Waters said that his office informed him of "the corresponding authorities and the legal facilities on false charges.
We will make sure that the suspects are exposed," adding, "and they will pay off legally their risky actions to my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Ain - a separate locker for Rowwan Atkinos
It is not uncommon for days to look at the Brixet in view of an English - related shooting show and the old comical and violent bulldozer of Johnny English - from 2003 and returned in 2011 to the Johnny English Reborn.
Would this interest - arousing movie talk about the news that we are no longer able to sell abroad?
This blind - looking man named Johnny English has received his license to renew his name, which shows that he is a target for non - English viewers.
He is indeed the best and most influential government of London's history in 2012 with the small Crouau, and Mr. Bean. Bean and at least one of the boys who sang a single piece of music in the Chariots of Fire in the dedication of the London Olympic in 2012.
He is even a traveler with a man of secret knowledge all over the world, who had imitated Barclaycard advertisements, leaving the conflict where he traveled.
There is one or two times a sound in the JE.
I liked the time Johnny English came to the helicopter in front of his forearms while the helicopter was touching his hat.
Atkinson’s gift of a laugh without saying a word is interesting, but it is not powerful when compared with such difficult products as 007 and the Mission Impossinle, which now include humor.
These comet comets, not older people, when I express the ridicule of Johnny English, do not show any skill in comparison with Atkinson’s novice shots while playing Bean
News in this exhibition revealed that the English are in serious trouble.
The Internet browser has unwittingly entered the network of devices on the Internet, and has seen the details of all the active English keys, until you are surprised by the number on the job - the small role of Kevin Eldon.
These stories are passed on by a proud high minister who deals with the problem of being unpopular as politicians: Emma Thompson tries to do what is right as she plays Teresa May but the author of the movie did not do well when writing it.
Wise counselors told her that just as all factors are at stake, she must restore someone who is retired.
And so says the fool Johnny English himself, who has had the position of high school principal, but who gives unorthodox lessons, while English teaches in a way that is more unusual than the real times.
English is returned to Whitehal and is informed of this emergency to meet his dear friend Bough, whom Ben Miller played again.
Bough is a married man, married and commander of underwater ships.
This capable couple returned to work and met Opheria Bulletin, which was eaten by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister believes in a multimillionaire that we can solve the problems of the English computer: the wicked man Jason Volts, played by Jake Lacy
The English and Bough started the surprises: they made themselves food providers, burned a French dieter; they started problems when they boarded the treasurer of Volta; and English brings up the attack while they stopped using the head of the Virgin Relicity for reading the inside of the Volta house.
Everything has been done in the final section, though interesting and entertaining, with television programs for children talking about it all.
Common things.
Like all other sports movies of Johnny English: Do I wonder if the black - market industry has been able to give Rowan Atkinson a proper role in his art?
The work force denys that it arranges for British citizens to work for four days but five to be paid
Jeremy Corbyn’s work crew organized a four - day work schedule - a - week but paid a five - day salary.
According to reports, the team requires executives to pay their employees for the amount of payment received when companies work for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) by granting them a date.
The change will result in a full three - day weekend but in a similar reward.
Sources say that the program will be “well adapted ” with the economic ideas of this group and the country’s remuneration plan to take responsibility for the staff.
The four - day move has rejected the support of the Trades Union Congress as the way of employees to take part in economic changes.
A top source of Labour Party told The Sunday Times: ‘ A study of systems is expected to be informed before a year passes.
‘ Not immediately, but a four- day working week is the ideal idea for this new economic group to be next to the employees and business plan of this group.'
The task force is not the first to provide support for the same ideas, and the Green Party was making a four - day program while changing the support of the election of 2017.
This system currently does not get full support from the Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Service Department said: ‘ The four - day work weeks are not a group schedule and it is not something to consider.'
The assistant director John McDonnell used a previous week’s work conference to explain his view of a social change.
Sir McDonnell says that he is willing to take the power of the ‘ authorities who don't want to be seen ’ and ‘ those who win' in big business.
The project manager’s plan says that the cashiers in the tank will not get their share as the service government can pay for the ‘ payments ’ that they do not do well.
He confirmed his plan to reassign employees to positions of authority in business and to make a public wallet with the purpose of giving employees a 10 - percent portion of private businesses that would give them as much as £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" that the FBI can change their thinking
A FBI investigation of charges put by judge Brett Kavanough delays the final vote with his arrest in the Supreme Court each week, and it raises the question that the results of the survey of the institute can turn the Republican network into a change of mind with the support they provide.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, the reporter of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley's most heavily armed Republics John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI can find something that can make them nervous.
Kennedy was not uncomfortable with speaking to her cousin from South Carolina.
"Yes" says Kennedy
"I'm going to get into the shower, saying, and talking to the judge Kavanaug.
I call him after this happened, after the charges had been issued, and said, ‘ Did you do it?'
He was calm, confident, not afraid.
Even so, it seems unlikely that Graham’s vote would never change.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanough and will be forced to report," he says.
Gqirh. Ford, I don't know what is going on, but here I know: Brett has strongly denied these vessels," adds Graham, speaking to Chrstine Blasey Ford.
"To everyone who speaks about him can verify these charges.
36 years
I don't see any changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to alleviate poverty?
On this Saturday, New York City welcomes the Global Citizen Festival, a annual music party with surviving singers who will sing with a good purpose; complete poverty.
This event has now lasted, and is welcoming tens of thousands of people to Centra; Park not only to entertain them with such features as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Menges, but to introduce them to the real purpose of this event to complete the severe poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a section to add to the Global Poverty Project, an international institution that hopes to eradicate poverty by adding responsible persons to the fight.
To get a free ticket to attend a party (except that you are willing to pay for the IVP ticket), you must do a volunteer job like writing to a world sponsor, calling on, or even if any means are necessary to inform other people of their reason for eliminating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen at 12 years of age been in the past?
Is it good to give people a good idea of how to break down support - people feel that they are making a difference by signing an Internet campaign or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen reported that he has forgotten 19 million acts performed on its supporters, with varying objectives in view.
It said that these actions have helped by encouraging the world’s taxpayers to report on commitments and financial systems that will be responsible for the lives of an estimated 2.25 million people in 2030.
As early as 2018, the group described 390 commitments and reports for their actions, and $10 million were issued.
The group estimates that the total amount of money they earn has reached nearly 64 million people worldwide.
Some of these commitments include The Power of Nutrition, which is a partnership with the U.K for the purpose of "helping children grow up to the level they have to reach," the agency promises to give Rwanda $23 million to help to end malnutrition in that country after they have received 4.700 messages from the Global Cities.
“ With the support of the UK, sponsors, governments of different countries and the Global Citizens like you, we may be able to decide the injustice of malnutrition, ” says the representative of The Power of Nutrition, Tracy Ullman telling the public when there is a crisis in London in April 2018
The group, after some 5,000 actions requested the U.K. to improve the proper nutrition of mothers and children, announced the cost of dealing with the problem, through The Power of Nutrition, which will help mothers and 5 million children to feed.
When they answer one of the most common questions asked on the Internet, "What makes you think we can end a serious epidemic?"
The Global Citizen said: "It's a long and difficult course - will sometimes fall and fail.
But as with a human rights translation and a campaign in competition before us, we will succeed, for we are strong when we are others.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Menges, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and others who will be happy at this New York's party, which will be welcomed by Deborah-Le Furness and Hugh Jackman.
America can use a water pot to interfere with Russia with the emissions of the Ecliptic U.S. Secretary - General
America can find safety under the navy in order to prevent Russia from selling electrical goods, including those in the Middle East, explains internal Secretary of America, Ryan Zinge as Washington Examiner explains.
Abbele has made charges that Russia is responsible in Syria - where those working under the government legally - set system plan to explore new ways of producing electricity.
"I believe that their Middle East purpose is to sell other countries as Europe has done in Eastern Europe, in South Europe," says.
And, according to the authority, there are ways and powers to deal with them.
"Amer has power, by means of a naval force, to make sure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their power of electricity does not move into the industry," says the U.S.A.
The whole was talking to the audience at an event accepted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group calling themselves "in the voice of electrical operators" in America.
He then compared the way America faced Russia and Iran, which he said they have not changed.
"The economic choice in Iran as well as Russia, is nearly as much as raising prices and obtaining additional oil replacements," he says, while Russia calls for a burea that is able to do one thing with the power of natural resources.
The report appears after Trump’s government made an effort to promote exporting water - produced gas into Europe, into Russia’s position, with no higher prices for Europeans.
As a result, the Trump’s government officials, including the American President Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the work of the “disrupted" Nord Stream 2, according to Trump, has done“ in exile ” of Russia, according to Trump.
Russia has also said that the Northern Straam 2, costing $11 billion, would double the present one to be 110 billion cubic miles [110 million cu km], is a better job than the economy.
Russia says that the American opposition to this work has economic reasons and is an example of improper competition.
"I believe that these powers should not be power of pressure, and the buyers have to be able to select the buyers," says the Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with American Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
America’s position in this situation was not well received in Germany that confirmed the commitment to this work.
The leading firm of the industry, the Federal Government (BDI), requested that America move away from the EU systems and contracts related to Germany and Russia.
"I have a serious problem when the third world interferes with our power." Says Dieter Kemf, head of the German Ministry (BDI) after meeting with the German governor Angela Merket and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.

At the city hall in Hoyoke, Warren of Massachusetts, is confident that he will enter the election.
"It's time for the population to go to Washington and repair our damaged government and that includes a man who has moved to a higher position," says The Hill.

Musarah PTSD by Track Alhan on Trump’s schedule
Track Palin, 26 years old, spends about a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence and Monday night
"What my son hears, what he is hearing again, I also feel sympathy for other families dealing with PTSD and other damage to our young masters who come back with it." He tells the audience of Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
"Palin said that his son's arrest was "a trouble with him," and said that the young men were going to face the wars "with a slight change, and with difficulty, they returned and asked if they had any respect for what they had done for their country and their soldier companions and flight crews included all members of the military.
She was arrested on Mondays at Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence by beating a man in a coma and having a flat arm, according to a spokesman for the Wallilla Dan Bennett police.
The 18 D.C. and D.C. sectors provides support in giving light to the new law in need of protection.
Eighteen government sectors and the Columbia area gave support to the development of a new law that caters to the victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 sectors of state and territory have included sponsors to provide support for one of the safety victims in favor of this legislation, states NBC.
The full name of the accuser in this case between Grace and Sessions of the American Civil Liberties Union was made in August concerning the unstated national law.
He said that his side was "with the sons of his cruel friends," who abused him, but American officials denied his request for protection on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas
Representatives of these sectors of government that provide the support of El Saador, Honduras, and Guatemala, are the main areas that bring security to many people in America, such as areas facing serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
This new law on safety in America sets out a 14-year decision made by a refugee board that allowed refugees to flee from domestic violence to find protection.
The Colombian General Karl Racine of Columbia reported on Friday that this new law "rejects old laws, governmental, national and international laws"
"The national legislation requires that all requests for protection be considered by the facts and circumstances of the request, and this rule ends," states the jubilee ensigned in court."
The attorneys also said that the law prohibiting refugees from entering America would harm the American economy, claiming that they were not available to be businessmen and do the necessary jobs.
General General Jeff Sessions issued a order to the judge that refugees can be given protection if they escape domestic violence or gang violence were removed in June.
"Security will also be obtained by anyone who has left home because of persecution or because he is concerned about race, religion, or political opinion," reported Sesions on June 11.
Security has not been made to deal with all problems -- I say that people face them every day the world over.

An American representative accuses China of ‘ abuse ’ using ‘ false advertising ’
A week later a Chinese official newspaper made a four - page advertisement for an American daily report on the commercial interests of America and China, an American representative in China accuses the country by using American journalists to spread lies.
The American President Donald Trump last Wednesday told of a campaign in China Daily on the Des Moines Register - a selling newspaper of Iowa - evasion in an effort to interfere with the liberation of November 6, which is a ground for China’s denial.
Trump's accusation that China is trying to interfere with election is a fact that American officers tell Reuters that the new developmental section for America to put pressure on China.
Whether it is customary for governments in different countries to employ ads to promote trade, China and America are currently fighting for trade and to increase prices.
China adds prices to the new trade problem and is designed to affect foreign suppliers in the interests of such as the Iowa who support the Rup of the Republican movement, say researchers from China and America.
Terry Branstad, American representative of China and former governor of Iowa, selling China a large portion of farm food, said that China had damaged American employees, farms, and businesses.
In China, Bradstad wrote his opinion in Des Moines Register, "he is now determined to exploit us by placing false ads in our free newspapers.
"When spreading false news, the Chinese government puts the risk of hearing America using its traditional manner of free speech and having free news and a place of advertising in Des Moines Register," writes Brastad.
"In contrast, instead of the news in Beijing when you come down from the platform, you will find a little different ideas and will never see how the Chinese think of the economic advance in China, we think the journalist is under the Chinese Communist party," writes.
He adds that "one of the most popular newspapers who has denied his request to publish this matter" has not reported where the newspaper is.
The Republicans dismissed the besieged prior to the promotion of the parish with Kavanagh's problem, warning the investigators
Like the high - ranking Republicans standing next to the Supreme Court prisoner Brett Kavanaug and protecting him from his accusations, sexual abuse, critics say they will see poor gain, especially among the people who have collapsed, in this coming election of the first half.
Feelings about this situation had gone too far, and the republics once again said they wanted to continue the election.
Those things you cannot put back on," says Grant Reeher, a university professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School who tells The Hill when an article was published on Saturday.
Reeher says that you doubt that the final attempts of the time are to start a FBI search to change the opinion of angry votes.
“ Precidents will not quickly forget what happened yesterday - tomorrow or November, ” says Karine Jean-Pierre, a top consultant and a national spokesman for the group that goes forward to Move On on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters again said, "You come to November!" while traveling through the central corridor as the Republicans controlled the Justice Committee and decided to continue the kidnapping of Kavanagh in spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"Your interest in freedom and increased enthusiasm," says Stu Rothenberg, an impartial commentator on the part of the public, telling the news center.
"People have begun to say that you have been up to now, this is true.
But there may be more to this than, especially to people who are too busy to decide who will vote with new appointees, 18-29 years of age, who, although not favoring the president but are not used to vote.
Even before the testimony of Ford of public officials explaining his charges against the Supreme Court of sexual abuse, critics say that the results can be negative if the republics are seeking confirmation.
"This has become a problem with the GoP," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republic’s National Committee last week when beginning, according to NBC News.
"It isn't important for the committee’s last set or whether Kavanaugugaugaugauga entracts in this case, about the way the Republicans deal with the situation and how they treat him," points out Guy Cy Cycil in the news center, the director of the Prarioties USA, an assistant team to the Democratic electees.
Even so, the lawyers seem to have no idea who they believe in the testimony of Ford and of Kavanaug, although there are a few who take the side of the later.
Forty - one percent of the participants in one survey showed that they may believe in or fully believe the evidence of Ford, while 35 percent indicated that they either believe it fully or believe the points of the Banaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of those who thought that Kavanagh might be a spy make sure that he was lying while giving a witness, at the same time only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Folake’s interest, the FBI is doing research on the charges brought by Ford and another devil, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
Ford has issued a declaration before the trial committee of justice that last week Kavanagh abused him with 18 sex while drunk for Kavanuagh.
Ramirez charges that this prisoner of the Supreme Court introduced his private organs to him when they were attending a ceremony while they were still in Yale in the 1980s.
Internet producers set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners- Lee, a Internet producer, starts a new business with the purpose of competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This technological marvel has a new system of Inupt, which produces Solids, a system available to anyone.
The Solid allows its users to choose where their details are preserved and who has the permission to see the details.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Le has discussed the Inupt purpose of "control all the world."
"We must do this now," referring to this business.
"It's a memory moment."

MMA'S supporters slept, not to see Bellator 206, but to find Peter Pig only
Consider now, for example, the fact that you want to look at Bellator 206 just to meet and not to play.
The San Jose system has 13 wars, including six distributed at night in Channel 5 in the UK.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegar Mousasi and Rory MacDonald, the UK observers were surprised to see the change in the playing of Peppa Pig.
Others are as disappointed as they are who stayed all night until morning to see the war.
One pursuer described this change in animation as bad quality
"The law of the government if from six in the morning the system was no longer necessary because they had to change what neither seen nor seen by children, "This means the president of the president of the advertising and communications of Bellator, when asked what had happened.
"Apppa the pig," yes."
The president of the Bellator Scott Cooker said that they would change their times next so that the UK observers would watch.
When I think of playing again, I think it might be possible," says Coker,
"The problem is that the time is six o'clock on Sunday mornings on Sunday we will not be able to do this until Sunday at once on Mondays to them.
But we have a plan.
I believe, when it changes by the way it entered many commands and all was not pleasant.
We tried to fix it, first of all, to think that our machine problem was just what we needed.
But otherwise, it had been a problem for the State.
I promise you that it will never again.
We will reduce five wars rather than shoot - out and try to bring something less than what they expected but what we did a lot of it.

Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley feels ‘ small' because of her sex.
Olympic oilist Tom Daley says that he grew up to be small because of his sexual appearance - but was interested in his success.
This 24 - year - old said that I had seen my second church if I was, "I am not like other people."
Commenting on the first policy of the Desert Island Discs under Lauren Leverne in Radio 4, he says that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give them "hope."
She said that if she was a parent, she would pay her no longer to take the Olympics.
The familiar director of this program, Kirsty Young, has been sick for months.
Standing like the lost man in Laverne’s first stroke, Danielle says that she felt the youngest in her life when she was growing up because she was “unable to love the boys and the girls.
“ Until this day, ” she said, “the feelings of a small and different feeling are the most important thing that has interest me and the ability to succeed. ”
He wanted to show himself to be "something," he said, so as not to be ashamed of everyone when they find about his or her sexual appearance.
This winner who has won two Olympic copper medals has made public public by the KGB and has used his fame this year to the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to make the provedr of justice.
She says that she feels fortunate to be able to live without being alone without problems and wants to give others "hope."
The winner of the world three times said that she had been in love with a man - the - American presented in 2013 - "unexpected. ”
Danielle is married to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than she last year but says that the gap between them was no problem.
"When you are faced with such things as a youth, - you go to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - says that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who has had the same life problems.
The couple became parents in June, and a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daisy says that "all his ideas" have changed.
"If you asked me last year I would tell you that I need to ‘ find a gold bar,' he says.
"You know, there are great things to complete the Olympic Golden poles.
My Golli bar Robbie.
Her son had the same name as his father, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after a brain tumor developed.
Danielle says that my father never accepted his death, and one of his final comments asked if they had any of the London tickets that he wanted to live on.
"I could not say that you would not be ‘ in the fore-and-aft',' he said.
"I held him by the hand when he finished breathing, and I saw after he didn't breathe again if he could not live forever," he said.
The following year Danielle competed with the Olympics for 2012 and found a copper bullet.
"I just saw that this was what I had always dreamed — to dip water in front of the crowd in the Olympic game, I could not feel any better way," he said.
She was also moved to utter her first song by Heather Small - in - law, her first song, that she was always interested in and frightened by the performers.
The Desert Island Diss is found at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11: 15 BST.
Muckelson in absent stage of play is applied to the Ryder Cup game on Saturday.
President Phil Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game but has to change the way he plays so as not to make this unhappy record.
Mackelson, who plays on the event twice a year in the 12th year, is awarded to Captain Jim Furyk in a soccer game of 4 and 4 persons.
Instead of being a popular spectacle, such as in a game for America, the winner who won five times spent half of her day playing without play and training herself for the purpose of correcting the problem.
Although he is at the top of the game, the 48 - year - old performer is not well qualified to play in the Gulf National Park, where grass is available and it is difficult for the players to catch.
If the stage of play is frightening in itself, Wilson, in the ninth weekend, faces Francesco Mlinari, who excels in playing the main ball of the British Open, who has collaborated with Tommy Fleeed who is still studying to win all their games on this week.
If the Americans, less than 4 points. If they could properly start 12 games on their own, Wilson’s game would be more important.
Foryk displayed the same trust in my husband as you would expect him to be.
"Because he fully understood his role today, he struck me a little backward and held my arm and said he would be ready tomorrow.
"You really trust it.
You have found a place for a famous hall and add much to this group in the past period, and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought he was going to play more than we did, but I didn’t think he was going to do as we thought he would.
He wants people to know him, as everyone else does.
Mackelson will pass Nick Fedo’s record of many games in the Ryder Cup on the Church’s game game.
It can make a decision of his playing in the Ryder Cup that differs from his personal record.
Mechelson won 18 times, was divided into 20 times, and Foryk said that his presence had brought unseen features to the group.
"You make fun, have a sense of humor, be quick to search, like a person, and a good person to be with in the gang rooms" explains.
"It's good to see young players laughing at him in this week to see this.
He provides only so much for happiness.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that it is possible to lose the rank of forward quickly
Thomas Bjorn, European vice president, knows that it can quickly be lost as the group goes ahead of the Ryder Cup but can change at any time.
The thief started playing in Valderira in 1997, where the case paid by Seve Ballestros was five times higher than America but was completed later, winning in 141 /131.
"You will tell yourself that you have many articles in Valderma; you have many articles in Brookline, where it is located and in Valderma, where we won, hard," on Bjorn, who is placed in the photograph, after watching the April 2018 video win by 5-3 on Friday and last in the 10-6 editions of the Golf National
Therefore history will teach me, and everyone in the group, if you have not yet finished this.
We will take away all that we have in the future
We will do everything we deserve to do.
This is not finished until it has points on the board.
We have a purpose, and it is an attempt to overcome the target.
Once again, I refer to the 12 players on my side, but we know what we are facing in the case of one of the players who has left them all over the world.
Impressed by the way his players played in this difficult play area, Bjor added: ‘ I didn’t really think of this.
The next day we will say something different.
The next day a player’s ability to play is checked, and that’s the opposite.
It’s good to have a companion when you’re successful, but when you’re alone, your strength is first tested.
That is the message that all the players are forced to receive, to manifest themselves tomorrow.
Now, you have to bring your mate with you to repeat it.
Unlike Bjorn, the man on the other hand, Jim Furyk has been looking for his players to play well and not as a group, except for the Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who received three - to four.
Furryk had been one of the two cases of the last day's changes, and he was on the side of the Brookline when it was conquered and divided as Europe performed the "miracle in Mednahh."
"I remember everything he said," in response to being Ben Crenshaw governor of 1999, how he became interested in them when they were going to the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but we should not think of it as you saw in Brookline and Mednah.
When you start winning every time, it puts the stress on the guitar.
We organize our players according to order and insert them in a manner that will produce good results, you know, we want to practice magic tomorrow.
Thomas is assigned to finance the battle and faces Rory McIllroy on a top game, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pulter of the Yurpohus in the upper galaxy.
"I take this group of men with me in this setting because I think it is all over," says Bjorn in this choice of individuals.
The German Warship has been reversed again.
A new German vessel should not be released in 2014 in order to enter the naval position known by the Cold War, but also the following year will not be released because of the problems of the ship and the costs, says the journalist.
The discharge of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a paid ship produced by Baden-Wuttermberg-clus trigrates, has been replaced by the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should not have entered the navy in 104, but the arrival of goods has made this possible.
These four ships of Baden-Wurettemberg in 2006 and will replace Bremen ships.
It was known that there would be a large armament, along with other fire-fighting equipment and aircraft and other technologies that would make it invisible to Radar, infrared, and acoustics.
What is important is that it takes a long time before it needs repairs — it can travel for two years without being at home.
Even so, continued disturbances make these new ships so - called new ships to supply strength to Germany across – are now out - of - date when they are being lifted up.
This-banked ship was launched in news last year, while the German navy refused to discharge the ship legally and returned it to Blom & Voss in Hamburg
This was the first time the navy returned the ship to the reserve after it was brought.
Little is known about the reasons for the restoration of the ship, but a German journalist says that there are problems with the "multiple" and goods that make the ship work well, which have made the ship useless during the war.
The machinery was more important as the ships of Baden-Wurettemberg are used by 120 persons and half of the people who are forced to use the old Bremen.
Also, it appears that the ship is too heavy to lose its ability and that the navy will not be able to improve it in the future.
This vessel with 7,000 tons of "Irheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have survived two times more than the ships such as were used by Germans in the second world war.
Despite the lack of goods, the value of all the work - including and the cost of teaching employees to use it is beginning to become a problem.
It is said to have measured to 1.1 billion ($3.6bon) - 1 billion.
The problems of these new ships became critical when it was shown that the strength of the German Navy is declining.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German Parliament's Security Committee, admitted that the Navy's fleet is "departed from warships."
The officer says that the problem of the elderly as the age goes on, since older ships are discharged from the service but were not replaced by new ones.
He then said that no other ship in the Baden-Wuerttemberg was able to join the navy.
New Trust listens to reports of migratory animals such as rats
A new dance in the Scottish Highlands requires an explanation of how these animals use their environment for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide some insight into the behavior and safety of these animals.
This is a study carried out by Scottish National Trust, which will follow these familiar animals, which make a noise like soprano, with long ears and Danubes at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording machines will be placed in a special place in this area to determine what they are doing during the course of the year.
The NHS staff and volunteer workers will make an examination of those present with hand - operated equipment.
Audiologists will take a closer look at the records in order to identify the animals they call together and what this type does.
The residence map of these young children and the record will be made to provide a picture of the behavior of these animals.
Rob Dewar, an environmental consultant of the NTS, hopes that the results will be to see what the animals like and what types of animals are used.
These details will help us determine what benefits are available to protect the wildlife habitats and how we can preserve wildlife habitats.
The presence of animals in Scotland and the UK has decreased over the past 100 years.
They are at risk as a result of building and improving habitats.
Air Turbines and light can put the animals at risk as well as flying paper and chemicals from buildings, as well as cat attacks.
These animals are not hidden from sight.
Even so, their daily need for food comes more often than their eyes when it comes to handling food.
They get their food by screaming as you go back to their ears with their eyes open to what they can eat or when they fly.
The NTS, responsible for caring for some 270 old areas, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of the world, consider these animals to be important.
He has ten trained professionals, recombinanting, surveying their accommodations and sometimes rescues.
The center has made a unique spot for these animals in Scotland at Threave on the dot of the Dumfries and Galloways, with 8 species of animals
The land manager David Thompson says that this is the right area for them
"Here in Threave we have a good place for these animals," he says.
"We have old areas, old trees and a good place to live.
There are many unknown animals, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help to explain what they need to survive.
He says that the importance of studying these animals before taking care of the environment is important, since damage to the environment of animal children can cost up to 400 children and parasites, which can cover all related factors.
These animals are safe and illegal to kill themselves, to distract themselves and their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, chief of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the community to help.
He said: "We still have much to know about these animals and how many kinds of animals we do not know."
Ronalo has opposed the charge of rape and will offer a German magazine to his lawyers
Cristiano Rolando calls rape charges false, claiming that people want to make a name for themselves.
His attorneys will pay off the German news agency Der Spiegel, the main source of the charges against them.
The Portuguese and Juventus are accused of rape by American assassin, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in 2009
He was said to have lost $375,000 to say nothing about the event, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Commenting on the widely circulated Instagram of 142 million of his followers after just a few hours of these charges were made, Ronaldo, who is 33 years old, is opposed to "false."
"No, just, you can, just, but, only.
What they said today, the lie ended, the winner of the Ballon d'Or five times referred to the camera.
"They want to make themselves known to people by my name.
It’s normal.
They want to be known by my name, but it’s normal for me now.
I am happy and ready," add the player, laughing.
Conalo’s attorneys are ready to appeal to the Der Spiegel with these charges, who said that "unauthorized reports of personal abuse," according to Reuters.
Justice Christian Schchertz says that the player wants to give a tip to the ‘ spiritual damage due to the abuse of personal rights over the past years. ’
The event is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the bar of a liquor, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to go to the player’s room, where they rape him back, according to the paper placed in the Clark County Region of Nevada.
Myyarga says that Ronalddo fell on his knees after the incident he was accused of being "good" and "9 per cent" of the problem is one percent.
Fathers say that Ronaldo has made sure that the couple are united, but they have agreed.
Miyarga says that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries to the hospital, but later they agreed to speak to each other without the courts because she felt afraid to get back and was afraid of being humiliated.
The 34 - year - old says that he now wants them to go back to work because what he says is doing still hurts Ronaldo.
Ronaldo was about to enter the Real Madrid from the Manchester United when this accusation took place, and in this summer it went to the vast Italian division of Juvenentus, which is purchased for some 11100 million dollars.
Brexit: UK will ‘ regret forever ’ for the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "will be sorry forever" when it will not lose its first role in producing cars after Brexit, says electronic writer Greg Clark.
Also, it was anxious that Toyota at UK had told BBC that Britain could walk over the EU for communications would stop a little to produce in their own factory in Burkinaston, near Derby.
"We need a combination," says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car producer said that the delay in the flow of goods from the border when there is no connection in Brexit can end the job.
The Burnaston – produceing Toyota Auris and Avensis – has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90 percent of that box was shipped to other countries in the European Union.
"My observation that if Britain is traveling on the EU at the end of March we will see the production from our production," says Marvin Cooke, the administrator of Toyota in Burma.
Some UK car breeders have expressed their fears about the movement of EU without the connection of trade, including the Honda, BMW, and the Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, will close its daily output in Oxford for about a month after Brexit.
Serious anxiety about this may also pose an economic risk when there is no connection with Brexit.
The Toyata maintenance list is conducted in the process of "oncoming," with vehicle goods arriving every 37 minutes from the UK and EU merchants in order for cars to be sold immediately.
Whether the UK travels on the EU without a connection in 29 March, there may be a barrier to the border where the business may be restricted and inadequate goods.
It will not be possible for Toyota to have enough clothes for the day in their Derbyshire, the business, and the production will stop.
Sir Clark said that the arrangement of Theresa May and EU's's' arrangements should not be taken into account of the problem of border checking.
"We need a combination. We need a very good combination that will allow us to take this opportunity," tells Radio 4BC on the theme Today.
"A witness from Toyota not only but also from other manufacturers explains that we need to continue where we were in the course of full effectiveness."
Toyota did not appear about how long the treatment will stop, and if you have a long time, warn that increasing costs will reduce the effectiveness of competition by the time you finish the job.
Peter Toullaviris, who has worked for the Burmanston for 24 years and who has assembled the Unite in this sentence, says that they are about to be concerned again. "The time I have worked I know when this work is going, it will never come back."
The government spokesman says: "Give us a reliable plan about the future relationship with the EU.
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be resumed, says the office of the president of the United States
The important Donald Trump's meeting and the general attorney Rod Rosenstein can be interrupted one week as he is the battle of the high court by Brett Kavanough continues, says the president.
Rosenstein looks forward to the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who did research on the content of Russia’s election, with the assembly between Trump and Russia and the removal of the law arm by the president
That Trump dismissed him and does not expel the general attorney, putting Mueller’s independence at risk, has been the cause of much gossip in Washington these past months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had suggested that he wear a device to record a conversation with Trump and that the possibility of removing the president by amending 25
Rosenstein denied this report.
But on the last day he went to the White House, between the reports and withdraw
Instead, the meeting and
Trump said that he would not be "defeated" to dismiss Roytein but then the meeting was delayed to judge the dispute in the Commite Hearing Plan where Kavanaugaug and one of the sex offenders, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave evidence.
On Friday, Tump authorized a one-week investigation of the FBI on charges against Kavanaug, which he has introduced to the total limit of Senate.
Trump, Mrs. Sarah Sanders, columnist of Trump, appeared in the Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about a meeting in Rosenstein, he said: ‘ The day that you haven’t been used, otherwise this week, I saw that the second week’s visit was given all the other things that take place in the high court.
But we will see and always like to keep thepress up. "
Some scholars disagree with this: The Sandemanians did not follow the White House line from 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of arguments was not due to the confusion of TV sales, although he said: "I won't agree with what they watch."
He proposed a direct connection between the Trump and the scrollpress.
"The President makes Q&A sessions and sessions rather than any previous president," adding without counting the evidence: "We look at those numbers."
Reports will happen, Sanders said, but "If the printer has the opportunity to ask the president of America directly, it is better to talk with me.
We try to do so and have seen him do a lot in the last few weeks and will replace the publishing theory when you can speak to the president of the United States.
Trump can always ask questions when leaving a White House or participating in open sessions or joining meetings with visiting sentences.
Solo news conferences are dangerous.
In New York this week the president may have indicated why, making a freeheeling and certain periods invisible before meeting with the media.
Health writer writes to EU staff in the NHS Scotland about Brexit fear

But the UK Government has had its plans about an impossible situation.
I know that this should be a very disturbing thing for all of you.
That is why I want to revalue the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of the country.
The brothers from all over the EU, and above, bring important experiences and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the sick and the people we use.

Traders of other incomes will be paid when buying the UK property
Foreign buyers will be paid when they buy the UK property and extra funds used to help the homeless under new Tory plans.
The increase will reduce Corbyn’s efficiency to attract the smaller votes.
The increase in the steam operation will be paid by those who do not pay the UK tax.
The NPO is expected to rise to £20 million per year to assist the homeless.
Traders of other trades are used to pay high interest rates for postage services in the UK - and extra funds used to help the homeless, Theresa May will bring them today.
The increase will seem to be an attempt to reduce the success of the Jeremy Corbyn's rudder to attract the small votes to provide purchased housing and to focus on gaining the upper ones.
The increase in the steam operation will be paid by the people and tax-payers in the UK, as well as the extra funds for improving Russia's driving and sleeping.
An additional fee for the modern steam operation, including high levels that were installed two years ago in two homes and up to 30 percent on cash.
Money is expected to raise up to £20 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of the new facilities built in London are purchased by the UK population, running costs and making it difficult for the first customers to find foot on the level of houses.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly capital - have been the "farmers" because of the high number of foreign consumers who spend their time in this country.
The new policy comes in weeks after Boris Johnson has asked that the stamp be removed to help new people with their homes.
He is persecuting big firms in the construction of the high price of property by removing the land but not using it, and he begged Mrss Meyi to leave the platforms in the homes that are purchased to repair the "digestment of houses" of Britain.
Sir Corbyn has brought up a list of plans, including rent control and the removal.
He also wants to give many large councils to build new homes.
Msz May said: “Last year I said that I would give your premiership to restore the British dream - if life is better for each new generation.
And that means repairing our house market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and make life here.
Even so, it may not be convenient for blind people in the UK, as well as foreign - based companies, to buy homes as British hardworking citizens.
For so many people the dream of homeowners has been too far away, and the destruction of a painful sleep remains real. "
Jack Ross: ‘ My best chest is to control Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says that his "high-desired desire" is to be the Scottish ruler at a certain stage.
Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of renewing the North-Easter bridge, which is now situated in the third place in the League One, and three are raised up.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in this period after leading StMirren in the Premiership of Stottish season.
I want to play my country like a player.
I have a B bull and I, "Russ told BBC Scotlandports.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Henden with me as a child, and it remains my protection.
That time will come, however, if I have succeeded in branch control.
Ross ’ leading officers as Sunderland administrator include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Payet, and Paul Di Canio
The former governor of the Alloa Athletic says he had no courage to follow the cross names in the main workshop, which had already cast out places from Barnsley and Ipswach Town.
"My success at this time will be followed by 'Do I restore this schema to the Head of the League?'
Because of the building and facilities in this game, there is no doubt that in the Premier League, he said.
"It's not easy to find there, but I'll probably check if I have succeeded here to return to the group."
Ross only three years in his care, after time as an assistant to Dumbarton and 15 days in Coachingstaff.
He then helped Alloa lose the third eye, and changed the StMirren from the Championship level in the next case.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than he had during his playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Warren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It was possible to be real," remembering, by taking Alloa.
"I really believe that the rule is better for me, than for me to play.
It sounds so good because I did well, made a good life in it, and enjoyed a great deal of excitement.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still go so far as to the pressures of the pressures and pressures of the work, but the control feels right.
I always wanted to control myself and now do so, feeling free to be in my bag in my life all the elders.

In all the popbs carried and drinking bars there were over 6.6 percent of the month, with 3 per cent meals.
Paul Newman, social commentators and entertainers, RSM says: "The results continue with the spirit we have seen since April.
The weather and the influence of large social or sports events remain the leading factors when it comes to selling in the outer market.
Not surprisingly, store groups continue to fight, although the rate of 4.8 percent of sales per year will be particularly painful at the costs of continued costs.
The long hot summer that has not arrived at the worst time for the propellers leading the food and time will indicate that the temperature taken by August will give more breathing.

Embalm declaration by comparing mothers and cattle to distinguish Internet opinion
The breast-pounder company has separated the feelings of sales on the Internet from a declaration that describes small mothers to the held cattle.
To illustrate the development of what is called the "First of the breastble bum," Elvie company's technical company has produced the theme of sic-in-cheek the inspired video presentation to demonstrate new freedom that the post provides to announce mothers.
Four mothers have dances in the born in fresh cow-bolts, which include sounds such as, "Yes, I am female, but you don't see the tail" and "If you didn't notice these things, they are not so."
The chorus continues: "Purmp iut, pomp iut, I feed a baby, pump it, pump it, and put my girls.
Even so, a message, printed on the File File Manager page, has a communications link over the Internet.
In 77,000 views and hundreds of nations, the video has received mixed answers to observers, many say that it means "to be disturbed" in the milk industry.
“ A proper solution is using cattle to announce the product.
As with us they must conceive and give birth to give milk, unless their babies are called in before the days of birth, "written for another.

Another said: ‘ It’s a clear concern for both mother and child.
But why not use them to publish popmp to mothers who will keep their children?
Another person added: "Not being seen in the sale."
Some protected the advertisement, one woman admitted that she had found a song "clean."
"I think this is a human idea.
I will have one if I have it.
Swimming made me feel like a cow.
The announcement was very painful, but I took it.
This is the product of the brain, "one wrote.
Another said: ‘ This is a good ads directed to the pop mothers (often in their places of work or toilets) and they feel ‘ like cattle.'
This is not a declaration that honors or condemns the milk industry. "
The end of the video shows that all were playing with the heavy pumps.
The posthumous theme is based on the thought that many prominent women of nursing feel like cattle.
The Elvie Pamp, however, is completely quiet, there is no wor or bubs and is close-on-sided, giving women the freedom to go, hold their children, and leave.
Ana Babarin, the partner and ECD to Mother, said: "Elvie's steam is such a turned product that was worthy of the start of liver and touch.
By showing the same similarity between women and milk cows that we wanted to place the beating of the breast with all the physical difficulty, while it illustrates how pleasurable and what a youthful freedom would bring.
This is not the first Elvie pump.
During the week of Mondon’s Fondon, the mother of two children appeared on a desiger cattalk Martha Jaboowski while using this product.

The number of children used to move out although the movement of the moon remains constant, thanks to the section that heavy control and control systems made by the Trump make it difficult to lay up children and support them.
Traditionally, many who support them have been foreigners, and they have threatened their ability to live in this country by moving on to call a child.
The danger increased in June, when the government authorities announced that supportive supporters and other adult members in their homes should wear fingerprints, and if the devil will be joined with the authorities.
Last week, Mitau Albence, the high executive and the Embassal Revolution, testified before the Council that the service is holding large numbers of persons who apply for the support of children who are not involved.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests did not have reports of criminal activity.
"Almost 80 per cent of the people who are supportive or support members of the family are currently illegal in this country, and the main chukk is the lawbreakers.
So we continue to follow those people, "Man.
In an attempt to improve the children rapidly, the officers promise new laws that will require others to appear in court within a month of the arrest, shortly after 60 days, the greatest restrictions, in terms of the local staff.
Many will appear to be a telephone conference, rather than a person, to defend their stand in a legal case in a immigration judge.
Those who are seen as unworthy of freedom will be removed quickly.
After a long period of time for children to stay in the cell, they may become anxious or depressed, which may lead to the end or escape, according to vacationers and reports that have appeared on the program for months to come.
Supporters say that this concern is raised in such a large center as Tornillo, where a child’s weight can be forced.
They add that taking the children to a tent town without allowing enough time to prepare for themselves physically or to say that friends can do a lot of damage to them.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish that it is fast dependent
In connection with the United Nations Convention, the Foreign Minister Wald al-Moulem also called the Syrian refugees home, although this is now the eighth year of national war.
Moulem, who also serves as prime minister, says that the outside forces of Syria are illegal, under the idea of war against order, and "It will be taken accordingly."
"They have to drive away immediately and there is no necessity," said the church.
Moulem stressed that "the war of the event is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died in 2011, and millions of other people were displaced from their homes.

The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, generally training and counsel for the Curdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al Assad.
France has over 1,000 wars on the ground in a war - torn country
In a refugee matter, Moulem said that these restrictions were ready to return, and he said that because of the irrational fear of the refugees living far away.
"We have called international territories and human organizations for this fee," he said.
"They have put into police station something that needs to be the concern of the people."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no restoration to Syria until the political treaty between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN links say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey is established at the level of the tampon, the main tower of the Idlibs created an opportunity to advance with political talk.
A Russian speech in Turkey launched a massive attack on the health - care Russians, where three million people live.
Moulem but emphasized that the treaty was "long arrived" and expressed the hope that the war-participation would point to the jihidas as well as the Al-Qaeda-contains associated with the Nsra Front, "which will be destroyed."
UN delegate Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon he will combine the first meetings of a new committee attended by members of the government and opposition to establish the Syrian military constitutional and to convey the choice.
Moulem set the conditions for the cooperation of the Syrian Government to the committee, that the use of a cane should be prevented from the "experience of present constitutional articles," and warned against disturbances.

Out of funds flooding in selected tribal areas
It is not surprising that 17 of Pennsylvania is seeing a flood of expenditures, due to the changing of charges in the affected areas in the same seat.
A region that was recently destroyed in the town of Pittsburgh was soon established in the Democratic Rep.
The Lamb works against another authorized person, the Republic Keith Rothfofs, which presently represents the Pennsylvania district of 12, which bears much of the burden of 17th.
The maps were raised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania sentenced in January if the old states were not under the Constitution in favor of the Republic.
The competition in the new 17s prevents the financial campaign between the large unit funds, the Democratic Community Committee (DCCC) and the National Council of Cultural Affairs (NRCC).
The Lamb became a common name in Pennsylvania after a small one in a special guest in March 18 of the Central District District in Pennsylvania.

Mr. Trump had a fine meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until a partner released a group of Trump Organization control.
Officials of the Department of Government have decided to restore the American delegates from El Salvador, the Rominican Republic, and Panama about "the later destructions if they are able to see Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, commenting on the Department, on this month.
But the terms were considered only about El Salvador, which earned $140 million about American iid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include the budgeting and insurance restrictions aimed at them, would be painful in the North American country and the absence of high jobs and mortality rates.
As the internal meetings continued, the North American and North American officials withdrew a high conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to follow the same convention last year that was seen as a major step in preventing migrants from moving to the United States.

Study history
The next index to drop may be Robert Mueller’s special advice on protecting justice, where there is abundant evidence in public records.
Mr Mueller is said to have answered his research and that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked with Russia in the attack of our election.

What will we do if Mr. Trump strikes Dr. Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the Future of Inquiry by Mr Mueller?

Mr Rosenstein says that the Times account is wrong.

It has been clear ever since Valtter Bottas was appropriate before Louis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes "groups' instructions will play a major role in the race.
From the post, the Bottas started the beginning and almost stopped Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two points and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel entered the first mines and left Hamilton to run to the park trailer, something he had to decide.
The Mercedes got out the bag later and got out after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some sexual activity he saw the Ferrari's pilot leaving in the danger of arrest after twice walking to protect the third quarter.
Max Verstappen began from the back row of the grid and was the seventh of his first voyage at the end of his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the contest as he held on to his shirts to direct his attention and to take Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
She eventually entered the mines on page 44 but was unable to speed up the eight remaining intervals as Raikkonen took the fourth.
It was a hard day, since Valtter was doing a good job all week long and he was a man who told me to let me do it.
The team has done a unique job to have a couple, "Hamilton said.
The team performed a task that could not be broken to the second, "Hamilton" said.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday meetings because of his insistence that he did not break the book from Christine Blasey Ford in condemning the president of the Supreme Court on sexual assault by Brett Kavanagh.
Speaking at a convention in West Virginia, the president did not express clearly the testimony given before the Court of the Court of Appeals, rather than focusing on the fact that what happened in the Senate shows that people were "speaking and being renewed and firm."
One thing that can happen and a good thing is going on for the last few days in Senate, when you see the noise, when you see people who are warm and talking and not speaking, "They said it.
"When you check for discharge and leak and said "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it. "
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinstein, do you pay?
Remember his reply ... do you pay a scroll - "O, what, what?
Oh not.
I didn't get up. "
Yes, wait a minute.
Are we near ... No, we didn't come out, "in addition, on a senator level.
Feinstein sent a letter to write on reports about the Kavanagh and Fordon in July, and it survived early September - but Feinstein had denied that the reward came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's reports, I didn't miss his story, "Feinstein told the committee," reported Hill.
"He asked me if I held it secretly and kept it secret as he asked.
But his denial did not seem well with the president, who said on Saturday night: ‘ I’m going to tell you, that was the worst thing my body was.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst kind of body I had seen. "
To further protect the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president explained that the Democratics are used for their rulings.
"They are determined to restore power in any way necessary.
You see the meaning, injustice, not concerned who is doing wrong, who must work to take power and control, "The Mediaite has said.

"ABILITIES," wrote Mrs. Plassco-Flaxman to her husband in a quote.
Nevertheless, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After observing her caffe, the Plasco-Flaxman was expelled by Mrssz Mauritius, saying that their outgoing, an African, had done a bad job and rather than wait for the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid one day and returned home in Uber.
Now, Maurice is preparing the couple for return, and he needs payment for $350 a day for 6 months, if he does not have a contract.
"I want to show it, see, don't do such things," he told the mail on Friday, adding, "I know that it's opposed."
The couple pointed out that they were prejudiced, saying that leaving Maurice’s work was practical, fearing that they could expect to be trusted after becoming upset with him.
"My wife sent him something she didn't like to say.
He is not a nation.
They are not people of a race, "Take Joel Plasco and tell Post.

Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of the person you read for the first time before you are printed.
I am amazed now that we know about great success in Paddington.
He says that his father, who served as BBC Cameraman before being inspired to write a book for children on a small tablet, would be a rare man about his banned work, adding that for 60 years this book was good "after his death last year.
In Paddington, explaining that “the most important member of the family, ” added that his father was automatically trusting in his success.
"He was an older man, and he was not a proud man," he said.
“ But because Paddington was true to her, it was hard for her to have a child who was perfect: she is proud of it though not.
I think he had watched Paddington’s success that way.
Although he was his creation and his idea, he always gave him a debt to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to lie on the phone
His daughter had been rushed to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors had worked in vain to save her life.
"NUd was constantly calling if it was wrong, if he was not expected to do it," said Nksz Edna-Laperous.
"After that I received a call from Nad that she was going to die within two minutes and I had to tell her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, I love you.
Soon I will be with you.
I’ll be with you.
Her doctor had given her a heart attack and had abandoned her program.
He had no time before the hand was ready, and all of this was closed.
I just had to stay and wait, knowing that it all occurred.
I was unable to cry or cry because I was put in a state of surrounded by families and people.
I had to get hold of it together.
Finally Sir Edna-Laperous, now in agony because of the loss of his daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who were unaware of the problem he was in.
"No one knew," he said.
"I was moved to my head, and tears were always known.
It was hard to explain, but it was in this spirit that I felt such kindness to Nad.
If she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him. "
Sexually transmitted death - prevention cards to a Bridge
Two women who lose a loved one to commit suicide try to save others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to the Welsh Bridge and encouraging messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to experience depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a contagious disease.
"Everyone knew about it because of his smile.
They often talked of her smile.
However, he quit his job before he died, since he was “in a dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who would find his brother after he was alive.
Msz Davis said: "I am always concerned that there will be a break.
Mrss Davis created cards, "let people know that there are people out there where you can talk to them, even if I am a friend.
Don't keep quiet - to - talk.
Msz Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Mrs Davies, was lost by Mark, his 15- year- old partner, shortly after Mother’s death.
"He doesn't mean he felt down or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed her change in attitude.
She was at Christmas down when the children opened their gifts she didn't compete with them or anything. "
He said that his death was a major cause for them, but they had to work with it: "You take pride in the hole in the family.

The future of Brett Kavanough depends on the charter as the FBI begins research
"I thought, if we could find something like what he asked it was - time research, it is limited in space - perhaps to bring in a little unity," says Mr Flavie on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee "to split up" between the combined Gidlock.
Why do Mr Kabasaugh and his supporters of the Republic want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of it is due to time.
The choice of the last five weeks will end in November 6 - if, as expected, the Libyans do wrong, so they will be very weak in their efforts to find a man who wants to be selected in a high court on earth.
George W. Bush has been calling on the Senators, asking him to support Mr Kavanaug, who worked at the Western House in Men Bush and met him and his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI issued its report?
There will be votes in Senate, where the Republics and the 49 Democratics now settled down.
It is not clear that Mr Kavanaug may reach 50 votes on the level of Senate, who will allow Mike Vence, president of the President, to break the chest and assure him of the Supreme Court.
Northern Korea factor number 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean authorities to South Korea has fallen from Kim Jong-un had power over the past seven years, said a South Korean lawyer.
The park of Mazeong-seug, which mentioned a net from the South's social service, said that there was 1,127 security last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the control across the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates paid by the tops of the tops.
The Pyongson did not make public ideas.
Most of the poverty - stricken people from the North are eventually provided for by South Koreans.
The Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority fled through China, which has the highest limit in North Korea and it is easy to cross over the District Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China refers to helpers as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and frequently return.
The relationship between the North and the South - who were legally active in the war had been extremely successful in the months to come.
Earlier this month, leaders from two countries met in Pyongton with talks aimed at diplomatic exchanges.
This appeared after a meeting of June's history between the American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed widely to work in a non-bulner pencil in Korea.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Minister Rongho says that the US sentences are due to a lack of progress.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no hope for our national security and under such circumstances, no way we will be used for the first time," says Mr Ri for a talk at the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanagh "index," and he is not ready to serve in the Supreme Court.
The junior head of the House Nancy Pelosi called the High Court of the High Court Brett Kabanagh and said that he would not be qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave an answer during a Saturday discussion in Texas Tribune Festival, Austin, Texas.
"I can't help, but I think that if the woman had done that way, they would say that they were ‘ assisting,' Pelosi said about his reply in Kavanagh before the Court of the Court on Thursday.
The Kavanagh had been officially approved of having had sexual intercourse with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
On opening the door, Kavanaug felt so much — at times he would cry and join in talking about his family and his high school years.
He clearly condemned democracys to the committee, which called criticisms for the "containment" and manisation of the person's organization, which are combined with special institutions if Hillary Clinton has lost a national election of 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanagh that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, for it showed that he was being abused by the Democratic community.
"I think you're ready for such explanations and how the Canons and the Democratics follow," he said.
Pelosi was stressed when asked if he would try to interfere with the Kavanagh if he was assured, and if the Democratic community received more than that.
"I'm going to say this - if he doesn't speak the truth in Congress or in the FBI, so he is not qualified to be a Supreme Court, but if he is at present," Pelosi said.
The Kavanaugh at present is a judge in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democracy he was concerned about the judgment of the Kavanagh Act or Roe v. He was far away, as he is considered to be a last resort.
In confirmation of his detention, the Kavanaugh had answered questions as to whether he could alter certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's no time for a dangerous person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It' isn't that,' says Pelosi.
And wives want to protect her.
Good attribe, month and age of noise, and he cannot do it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 afterward.
"I don't think about something unusual, don't I?"
He continued, "I was greatly helped by a lady who was a ruler in a certain area, who also cried when she cried, but she developed a process that meant that when she took off and started crying, she said to the person with whom she spoke, "You think I’m sorry because I cry.
I am angry.
And she kept going.
And I thought it was wise. "
Tears are permitted as a result of a misunderstanding.
One of my sharpest reminders than my first job, in a man - controlled office, where I had found myself crying in an unutterable rage, I was caught by an elderly woman - I’m always afraid of who pulled me to the stage.
"Don't let them see their cry," he told me.
“ They know you’re upset.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they come to you. "
Patricia Schroeder, so the Democratic Society of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his career as president.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught off the flats outside the ship called Montkey and came out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder was very concerned, he might think there was no reason for him to find no reason to take advantage of the idea of driving the president himself.
"There was no clear decision," he said to me with a laugh after 30 years.
"There were seven who were heard in the contest, and the last thing they wanted was one.
Another called "Snow White and Seven popular."
Because it was after the campaign, it was after financial support, and she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she had raised $2 million.
It was a missing war.
She found that some of her clients who contributed 1,000 to the men would give her only $2.
"Do they think I've got trouble?" he wondered.
When he made an announcement that he would not establish a legal campaign, he was suffering emotional abuse — thanks to the people who supported him, frustration and a policy that makes it more difficult to raise money and vote the votes rather than the delegates, and anger on the sexism - if he was mature.
"You think I’m going to be disturbed," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about the way the printer responded to him.
"You think Kleenex was my company's assistant.
Do I remember thinking, ‘ They will put me on my stone? ’
"He stayed up"? "
The US-Y and China war trade may be a good thing in Beijing
The open salvos trade between the US and China were deaf, and while the fighting was far away, the conflict between countries can be useful to Beijing for a long time, say experts.
Donald Trump, President of the US, issued the first warning early in the year by pressing out foreign talks that include solar panels, steel and aluminium.
A significant increase has been made this week with new $200 billion payments, which cost goods, in terms of all US taxes from China.
Beijing is re-refited again, the digitals has recently paid the fish ton per cent of America's $60 million.
China has promised to compare US sin-shot-shot, and most of the world's size would not be possible to combine any time soon.
Finding Washington to return to the ground means taking orders, but bowing to the United States will be very embarrassing to XJinping, president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards properly, the enforced US wars can certainly contribute to China more than a long time by reducing the dependence on other countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the conditions that begin to throw us out of the country are really more dangerous than the observers previously seen," says Abigail Grace, an open - minded friend leading to Asia, says the New American Security Force, a thinking tank.
Syria's provision for refugees to return, says the President of the United Nations
Syria says that she is ready to return to the refugees and encourages the reconstruction of a war - ravaged country for over seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Convention, President Wald al-Moulem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the state of the world is certainly grateful for the progress made in protecting violence," he said.
The State continues to renew damaged areas so that they can restore routines.
All the circumstances are present now to the voluntary return of refugees who have been driven by violence and uninhibited economic values that focus on their daily lives and on their lives.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syria has fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who live in this country need people.
And Al-Moulem said that the kingdom of Syria would receive help in rebuilding a desolate land.
But he stressed that it would not accept limited assistance or aid from the nations that support it.
