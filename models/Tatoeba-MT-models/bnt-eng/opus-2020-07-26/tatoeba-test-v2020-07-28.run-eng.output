You have to get there.
Why at home?
Asa and his father.
Do not hold back.
I am new.
I shall not bow down to them.
We know what you do.
What is your father’s condition?
I know what they said.
Why not?
We will meet again!
What a surprise!
I don’t have a place to live.
You can.
The last year, I was born.
I am sure that I have seen her all the time.
You are a good person.
Where is your family?
The best results would be if you did not go.
I’m not hungry.
I am a university student.
I missed my keys.
We are not alone.
I want you to know.
What are your benefits?
He knew exactly what to do.
It made me think.
I am one of your students.
Why not learn French?
Not necessarily.
I want to see you.
I’m glad you are there.
When does it arise?
Does Tom know why?
When am I?
We have no money.
Forgive me!
I do not need them.
I talked to my parents about everything.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
Yes, indeed.
Not only does it wither but it also changes.
I lost my pencil.
When does it arise?
You can find any color you like.
She prepared all the meals.
They had no money.
You are a good parent.
Are you going to come or come?
I want to take it with you.
Do you want to become rich?
I just move on to the next challenge in life.
If you don’t listen, they’ll come.
This is my father.
I’m curious about that.
What did he not understand?
I don’t think he’s coming.
I can’t believe it.
They say that he is very rich.
His Word was remarkable.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
None of us really know him except his parents.
I was able to do it.
I don’t think he’s coming.
She wanted it.
The sun shines directly overhead.
Why not?
It will be a wonderful time.
That’s all right.
I remember that first day.
Do you want to take them?
Has it been called lady again?
Let me explain.
My brother and I were away.
My parents called me to the bottom of my property.
What are they doing here?
Do you have a brother?
Now look at the picture.
I’m on a car.
What are you able to do?
Is that your mother?
Why do the heavens look blue?
If you do not, come anyway.
This car is ours.
No one here owns a car.
A choice for us!
I do not know the word.
Light.
I’m glad you are there.
Are you looking for us?
Remember!
For what purpose?
They don’t give me a chance.
My daughter is going to be married in the sixth month.
I know these women.
I understand what you say.
I don’t know.
Where do you know my name?
Do you want to, or do you want to?
Is this love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are twelve months of the year.
I have a question.
I felt that you were married.
You’re going or you’re going?
Previously, he was a teacher.
Take your time.
I could not believe my eyes!
Who Do You View Me?
I have seen that.
You want to find out.
Vows are made by credit.
He is not with you.
I don’t like these people.
Do you want something to drink?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
She just listens.
It seemed to you that they were a failure.
Take a taxi to find you in the hotel.
You have come, are you?
He is coming!
No, they are not.
I don’t know how long.
Whose space is this?
Old Age?
Not at all!
No one knows what needs to be done.
Do not ignore them.
I shall ask him.
We return.
I’ll see you.
I know a lot about you.
That’s all right.
I want to learn French.
My car broke down.
You know that I love you.
I knew him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is going on.
He left the key of his car.
Why were you not at home?
Can I see them again?
Do you make a distinction between the sheep and the goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I bring you to school.
Do I know Tom?
Are you satisfied?
May I come back?
That is why I love you.
Are you in your home?
The heat will be intense.
Give me, as a token of your preaching work is.
It is preceded by a new thought.
It’s too hot.
You know that I love you.
It is very warm.
Our journey comes from time immemorial.
I accepted the money.
What would you like to see?
How do you go to school?
Are you new?
I know what to do.
Do you enjoy studying?
Do you have money?
I’m not sure.
I know how to do it.
What are shoes?
I’m glad you are there.
This book is a good one.
Thank you for killing our family.
I respect you.
Why, it is very unlikely that we would do so!
He is powerful.
The amount is five dollars.
I moved to my mother’s house.
No, it is not.
Your leg is dirty.
I am around you.
Thank you.
Do you enjoy studying?
I will give it to you.
Excessive drinking is not to be overlooked.
I want to.
You are my friend.
Where is our car?
No one knows what needs to be done.
What school do you attend?
You do not want to know!
He is a good student.
They pop up unexpectedly.
Get a book and read it.
I don’t have a home of my own.
Thank you very much.
I know you said that.
I’m thinking about that.
She is happy.
I was hungry.
You don’t know.
Do not let that happen.
I wish you were home.
My daughter is left to attend.
He was raised by his grandmother.
I let him down.
I want to go home.
They do not know.
I have my brother.
I made this property for myself.
How long do you want to last?
Early the next morning, I left home at two o’clock.
I gave up my glasses.
Why were they here?
What is love?
We understand.
I love this book.
Please read on.
You are my dear wife.
I will make you happy.
It is ours.
Where is your family?
Do not say the same thing over and over again.
Good morning, I’ll send one to you.
Where are we going?
It’s too late.
You know where I will be.
What is the purpose of your visit?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
You stop the car.
I am not good enough.
Do you know what you must do?
We know.
No, thanks.
Where do you want to live?
I love the place I live in.
Do not ask questions.
Should I Open the Window?
A few drops of rain.
Where are you going?
Do not lose your joy.
You have to go home.
Is he here?
Are you learning the French language?
Repentance will also be a means of great change for the better.
Please visit me.
Where is my car?
I don’t know how.
I saw my sister there.
I know what I’m doing.
I gave a book to a boy.
Who is your teacher?
I am doing it with you.
This girl is dressed as a boy.
I have no brother.
Sadly, after moving, my older friend moved to another town.
Go home?
You know I have to go.
Here’s your copy.
It’s not my day.
For how long?
If he had stayed home that day, he would have had no accident.
She speaks not only English but also German.
I’m not interested.
I know what is going on.
I know you do.
Is that not wonderful?
I know what you think.
It’s hot.
I wasn’t good enough, so I had to change it.
The best results would be if you did not go.
This girl is dressed as a boy.
I like to see you at work.
I have to work on my hair.
Too little?
My sibling is my brother.
I’m happy for you.
Do you have time to help me with something?
Turn it off.
I don’t salute them.
Do you know what love is?
The marriage takes place on Saturday.
“ I won’t die.
Tell me your goal.
Is this literature unique?
I lost my pencil.
Thank you for coming.
I am a cook.
A man is standing behind a wall.
I missed a school.
Make no mistake about it.
Did you notice it?
Are they seeing us?
Are you a good carpenter?
When I come up from the field, everything is chaotic.
Is there a brother there?
We see you.
They are children.
“ Let’s face it, Tom, ” she says, “and don’t be afraid!
Keep in mind what could happen if you were to carry a letter.
I know he loves me.
There’s a way to look.
I too attend school.
I don’t have a brother.
I struck a match with the finger.
What do you see?
It’s embarrassing.
Do you know where?
Where is your father?
Don’t ask me again.
My father is at home.
I feel worse than I am.
Japanese?
Give me a book.
You are a good person.
These windows lay in the south.
“ I forgot to buy bread.
I shall walk in the day of God.
We can't see it.
Where do you come from?
We are here for you.
I don’t know where he lives.
There are a hundred people in the hall.
I understand.
You have no teeth.
Not really.
My dream had come true.
I can talk to you about it.
I don’t know what to say...
Do you know where?
I am not a university student.
Let me see.
Are you our spouse?
Do good to those hating you.
Not the same.
It is smaller than it is.
Scientists don’t do anything today.
We are so happy.
This young woman is pretty.
Please visit me.
I am not a good carpenter.
You don’t know.
Tell them what happened.
I wish you were home.
I have done it with you.
I love your vehicle.
Who is your teacher?
If so, are you?
Does that appeal to you?
It should.
Undoubtedly.
Have I been successful?
I do not know him.
I’m glad you are there.
I need comfort.
I stepped out of it.
Make no mistake about it, you can do something else.
I don’t know what to think about.
I don’t know what to do.
What accounts for this?
Where am I?
Do you know his name?
Money spent.
I want to borrow a car.
I want to join her.
They’re not in the right mood.
Your time?
We signed.
Right then and there!
I missed my keys.
I never hear that word.
I don’t expect you to be somewhere today.
I want you to.
This house is my home.
I’m interested in your car.
They say that he is very rich.
No one can be certain.
To go or not?
We don’t.
There was a temple on this site in the past.
I know you said that.
Oh, I’m praying.
Why not go home?
Do you feel that way?
They don’t give me a chance.
What would you like to see?
Why ask?
He is coming!
They don’t beat me up just for the fun.
I’m sure you’re really strong!
Take your stand.
I know the girl.
It did not die.
You are a good parent.
Do you want a car?
I don’t have any money.
Do your schoolwork.
I want to accompany you.
I know only his name.
Asa and his mother.
I will make you happy.
We understand that.
What is the family like?
I speak a little Spanish.
And by all means!
How old is he?
I need to know the reasons.
You are not our brother.
My family is small.
Does Tom know why?
Is she at home?
I love mathematics.
I know what to do.
Not the same.
Nothing happened.
We meet each other.
Not at all!
Where is Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where did you come from?
I don’t know French very well.
When does it occur?
They had no money.
Share what happened.
How many is this phone number?
We are intrigued.
Not a revolution.
Let me explain.
Sooner or later.
You are his publicity agents.
Should all of this take place?
I don’t expect you to be somewhere today.
He nodded.
Are you our spouse?
It is not something to boast of.
May above!
I love this car.
I know where to look for security.
Your feelings are similar to those of your A.
How much is it worth?
Take your time.
Not out of the question!
Where do you want to live?
Be observant.
He just listens.
Keep in mind what could happen if you were to carry a letter.
We are here for you.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Get rid of your shoes.
They do.
When does it arise?
I will not give up.
I came from England.
Let me explain.
Let me explain.
The windows are open.
You don’t have to come.
She just listens.
I never forgot it.
I don’t think he’s coming.
That’s all right.
Corn comes in two forms.
I know how to do this.
He did not ask her.
They want us to do that.
What do you see on the outside?
I know it really makes you happy.
I shall lack nothing.
Where is Tom?
What is French?
The owner of the literature was my sister.
From tomorrow we may be able to get us to work.
We arrived.
I am learning French at home.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they are going.
It is a strange book.
Our perceptive powers are weak.
I know your father.
I learn French in school.
You have to go home.
Where do all people go?
Can You Open a Window?
Will you move here to this summer?
Where is my mother?
Not now, when?
What do you want?
Where is your car?
My father was not at home.
Not at all.
Do you know anything?
Not at all.
Are you looking for them here?
There are no wealthy people here.
Here a hole in the ground is surrounded by holes in the ground.
She knows him.
It’s a pleasure to see you.
I was never at home.
Look!
What is this phone?
You can sing the song.
Forgive me so much!
I know how to do it well.
We’re not hungry.
Maybe you would like to understand them.
Where are we?
Love is not blind.
Let me explain.
I know you have.
I’m not a student.
I’ll try.
A strong wind drives me crazy and can’t move about on the way.
Maybe you do not.
I noticed that one day my sister was walking with me.
I do not give up.
How Much Time Will You Give Up?
Asa and his Father.
What are these?
You are a success.
My house is next to a house of worship.
Failed to set a word!
Every drop of water will be eaten by the pigs.
I could not look.
I do not want to read them.
Five of them know his name.
Do you know where they were?
Where do you go to school?
Where?
What a beautiful thought!
She gave it to me.
I never saw him.
Where is your mother?
We listen.
Why do people say that?
Passage should be highly valued.
I have vowed to do just that.
I don’t speak French anymore.
Nobody!
Why do I have to do so?
It is Saturday.
So I did that.
I am a cook.
How many?
We have no money.
I know you’re paying attention.
Take your shoes.
I know how to look good.
I was happy.
Is the car new?
Why not enter?
She did not read the book.
I don’t want to be rich.
Please allow me to say that.
The helmet protects the soldier’s teeth.
That will make us happy.
You can do it.
When will you come home?
She did not read the book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is a new one.
She knows him.
Frenchman.
I don’t have a car.
Pay attention to your head.
Why not make it clear what you have in mind?
I want you to see him.
You can use this vehicle.
He does not attack.
He is a teacher.
I came to love him.
I’m not a student.
Would you like to see this?
Just let it be!
I love you.
He came on his own.
I bought eggs and a few eggs.
One fold is missing.
I saw him again.
Is this your mother?
We grew up as a family.
For what purpose?
Are you looking for us?
I’ll be in my car.
I don’t like running.
Frenchman.
He is a tall, handsome young man.
I know what they are.
You know how well you do.
I have a car.
When Will You Come to Your Home?
Nights at 6: 00 a.m. are a time of rejoicing.
You do not have to come.
You have to stop drinking.
Have your say in your heart.
There’s a way to look.
Where did you stop the car?
Minute between 1 hour and 2 hour
Let the man on the housetop not come down, nor go inside to take anything out of his mouth.
Which ones does not?
Where is the book?
The Americans?
What do they look like?
Let me explain.
I’m reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
Not so with you!
Find us?
Where are your belongings?
What error is?
Drink.
He is coming!
I’ll never get away with it
I’ll take a quick glance at you.
We are happy.
Cover and fresh air.
They don’t respect me.
I took them.
I’m not hungry.
I understand.
Not really.
I learn French in school.
Why?
I want you to go home.
Asa and his mother.
Do you search for me?
Put it in your mother’s arms.
You know I have to go.
Where is the automobile?
Do you love him?
We have to keep average between outputs and inputs.
The serpent caused the snake, or serpent, to strike.
They are not coming today.
Do you know what it is?
Open the Window!
Why, our home is worthy of note!
He is a brother.
Why Not Go to School?
Why not go home?
Can I get in?
You know that I love you.
Researchers have returned to the bone of the cave.
Our journey depends on time.
Can I see them again?
These steps can prevent an epidemic from getting under control.
I am a factory.
We have been told to eat together in the afternoon.
Do not lose your temper!
Not a conversation; we simply go to a movie.
I fell in love with her.
Why not go home?
Come out of my room!
I am new.
I want to learn French.
I am coming to you.
I’m not my sister.
I lie down without cause.
I have a purse.
The waters fall.
If only I had been away from home!
I try to express my thoughts and feelings in words.
What Is the Value?
I know where we are.
Why Do They Not Come?
I’m on my way to get my car.
Why are you not in class?
We are university students.
I don’t know his name.
I’ll have to get over it.
How do you go to school?
Forgive me!
Turn it off.
Do not put it off!
Do you know what it is?
Please allow me to say that.
I know his family.
I know.
I missed my keys.
I’m content with this.
They don’t give me a chance.
What is the purpose of your visit?
Why not?
She does not speak English.
I ate eggs yesterday.
Right, wrong?
We know him.
I want to get some rest.
He did not ask her.
We’re not hungry.
I was in a state of shock.
I talked to my parents about everything.
I wake up at 7: 00 a.m.
Don’t open the window.
Well, consider.
Why not?
Why does it get hot?
Unless it is raining, he goes to work all day long.
It is ours.
See the bigger picture.
How does your brother feel?
Can We Talk?
Where are you going?
I loved the sound of the car.
Why learn French?
I think so.
I see your point.
I know who hears you.
He accused the man of stealing.
It was a kind of work for me to do.
I’m not listening.
I don’t know their names.
Explain your goal.
I know what to do.
They say that he is very rich.
Your leg is dirty.
Are you not German?
Do you love him?
"Is this one popular?" – "Father."
You don’t have to thank me.
When did you arrive that evening?
We want you to take them.
Asa and his mother.
Being alone, let us make sure that we have a balanced view of ourselves.
We have come to see you.
Do you want to, or do you want to?
It’s not my car.
I don’t know his name.
Do you want something to drink?
You do not know what has happened, do you?
I know what love is.
Not one.
The arrow is more likely to hit the target.
What are you doing here?
I am a factory.
They do not prepare me for life.
We study in a one - room library.
Where?
It made me think.
Do you have rice?
Is he here?
We won’t be pleased with that.
We are born.
I know why you are here.
Why did you study college?
Where is your mother?
Sooner or later, he will be confronted with the reality of those words.
When will you return?
I dropped off.
Thankfully, you can.
Listen to your mother!
Read this.
I will give it to you.
What news?
They were in my room!
What kind of tea is sweet?
Do you want something to drink?
I am the youngest.
How much is it worth?
I would like to read this book.
After Bresil.
I’ll take you home.
We study in a one - room library.
Do Not Forget You!
Write it down to us.
Do not blow a trumpet ahead of you.
Do you have this money?
Not too much.
It is his job.
That is what you have asked for.
He is our brother.
What Do You Look for?
Am I Addicted to Electronic Media?
She wanted it.
I want to.
Stop making rules here!
Sometimes we go to a movie together.
Is that not so?
What did you read?
Where are we?
Why do we do it?
These are extremely tall.
Do you believe that it does not matter to me?
There are gaps — missing pieces — in the bark.
He is our brother.
It is his job.
Do you know what they said?
I’m not sure.
They do not know.
American?
A cup or tea?
What is going on here?
I am sorry to say that I let you down.
We are alone.
I love what I am doing.
My voice has been numbed from an injury.
Do you know what that meant?
His words were a remarkable word.
When do you want to move?
I don’t miss any such experiences.
Is that better?
Are they too in Japan?
I’ll try.
Does he or she know that you love him?
We are wasting precious time.
Why not?
Study the appropriate session talk without being distracted by other languages.
Where is his family?
Magdalena and Anita are good friends.
I’m happy for you.
We need to eat together during the day.
Take one.
Do you have a brother?
We are here for a long time.
I do.
I have to think.
Where is Mary?
I was devastated.
I have to finish.
I’m glad you are there.
Do you think you are happy?
Why are you not with me?
Not at home.
I have said so.
She fell in love with him.
She is not pregnant.
What was the reason?
How Much Should I Donate?
What did you give me?
Get out.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not rich.
He wipes the slate clean in his eyes.
Not really.
Too late!
I will be a part of them.
How many nights?
Yes.
I was greeted by people with warm, friendly smiling faces.
You have to go home.
Asa and his Father.
You are my helper and my rescuer.
Do you know where he lives?
I don’t like it.
Why don’t you go with me?
Give me your time.
Do you have some money that I value?
It is a marvel of design.
I wish you were home.
I don’t have a brother.
I don’t know.
I don’t know how to keep names.
Can You Do the Same?
I guess I did.
Do you know these people?
What will this involve?
Why do I do it?
I don’t understand.
This factory makes machines.
I’m not a student.
It makes sense.
Do not do that again.
Position in window.
I don’t like it.
One fold is missing.
Get the money.
She is happy.
Running in the car.
Would you like to know why?
Do you want to?
Remember your kindness, and let it pass.
I am the youngest.
What do you think this is?
We wanted the day - to - day talks in our language.
So why have you come here?
I’m not sure.
I went to school.
He did not say a word.
We are born.
It’s too hot.
So I did that.
“ I have to learn.
Thank you very much!
That would only be natural.
Does that make you happy?
You are ours.
What was that purpose?
I don’t have any more clients.
We are university students.
There is nothing new.
Come?
Can you enlarge on that?
No one had seen anything.
I’ll try.
I would like to ask, What are you going to do?
I know the girl.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He needs water.
Where have you been?
That’s all right.
I do.
How many cups of coffee have you drank?
What’s wrong with this office?
This car is fine.
Yes.
We were exhausted.
We’ll do that.
Your information?
I know you have.
I’m sorry I’ll yell at you.
Children.
He is a teacher.
We headed down the mountainside.
I can’t remember any names.
Do you want to become rich?
I would like to read this book.
Never may that happen.
I am a university student.
These provisions are available to us.
They do not want us to know.
It’s not my car.
You're on the red light.
I know what I’ve been assigned to learn.
I miss you very much.
I can hear you.
I want you to go home.
We go together.
Give a chance.
I am not strong enough in this regard.
Nobody!
It is not something to be proud of.
Do you understand French?
I find it hard to think.
It is preceded by a new thought.
What Is This Wine?
I have my brother.
They do not waste a lot of time.
If you need help, call me.
I too.
That is what we did.
Here they are not wealthy.
What does he want to accomplish?
Listen to your mother!
I love mathematics.
He is coming!
We go there together.
Next week.
I love to look at your recipe.
What do you do?
It is a weed.
Would they?
You know that we love you.
You can distinguish sheep from goats.
I’ll have to think about that.
He just listens.
I love to learn French.
Perhaps we can take it to seaside this seventh end.
Why?
You have come, are you?
You have to go home.
How old is he?
I knew.
I’ll never get away with it
He does not seem to be happy.
I know where to look for security.
All day long he has to work outside the home unless it is raining.
Thank you very much!
I don’t want to quit.
What is going on here?
I’ll see a game.
It seems very practical.
I’m reading a book.
Do you know who the car is?
It is a weed.
You are a good student.
Remember this.
I know exactly how old he was at another time.
Do you have time off?
I love long hair.
Are you planning to go to a meeting?
The shower had stopped me.
Disorientation.
No, they are not.
