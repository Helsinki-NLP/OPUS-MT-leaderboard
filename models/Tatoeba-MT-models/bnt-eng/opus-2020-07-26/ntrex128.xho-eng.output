Members of the Health Organization (AMs) in Wales are concerned about appearing to be stupid
There are the concern of the Ams because they are being lifted to be MWPs (A member of Parliament of Wales).
This has been done because arrangements have been made to change the name of the convention into the Welsh Parliament.
The Ams in every political sense fear that this will lead to their being burned.
One AM Labour says that his group is concerned that the pronunciation of this new name is closer to the terms "Twp" and "Pwp."
To the student who does not live in Wales: Welsh tap means a stupid one, and rap doesn’t speak tufa.
The AM of Wales has said that the whole organisation is not interested in this, and has suggested other names.
A member of the Conservative Society in Wales claims that his team has no problem with the change of name, but he has seen that it would be easier to call MWP in the way you call a fool.
In this case the English form of the letters w is the same as the letteru is called in English.
The Assembly Commission, engaged in creating a policy of changing the name to this new one, said: "The decision of how to call the Members of the Assembly will be taken by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission released results in public answers and found that the majority support the conference’s renown to be called the Welsh Parliament.
In a system of calling AMs, the Commission prefers that Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMPs, but people support MWP.
The AMs are said to advise otherwise, but that it is difficult to agree on this matter must be the problem with Ellin Jones, the Chief Officer, who is expected to make some changes in the weeks to come.
This policy of change will include other changes such as the function of the conference, including the ban on AMs and the structure of the committee.
Ams votes that will finally count when the law is discussed in the question of how they are called.
Macedonians will vote in political elections
The voters will vote on Sunday even if they have changed their country's name into the "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The vote is made to resolve a centuries - old conflict with neighboring Greece and the province of Macedonia.
The Athenians once claimed that the name of their neighbors in the north made them an encumbrance in their area, and for a long time, they had been against their claim to be members of the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjoge Ivanov, opposed the switch vote, gave his attention to the title.
However, supporters of the poll, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this change of name is the price they have to pay for to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin Beats as Churches St. Harlem
Mr. Adams said: "The old people I've spoken to said that there was a bar and a church everywhere."
"Today, not one of them."
He explained why the barley was immediately absent.
He said: "People are having a good time" these days.
"Bari is no longer the living areas of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
You are concerned about the churches because you think that the money they have received from selling their goods will not last as long as the leaders think, "and they will soon return to their original position."
The churches, he adds, may be replaced by people who will never help to retain the local holy areas.
He said: "Most people who buy these labels are white people; therefore they will soon come to the day when the churches are closed, because they don't seem to be members of these churches.
Both churches were white churches before Harlem became a black place, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, in St. Martin ten years later.
The first white Methodist Church appeared in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregation she served became the very one that was built.
St. Martin became a black congregation under the Death. John Howard Johnson, who led a merchant exchange at 125th Street, the best street to be purchased at Harlem, which was opposed to unemployment and lack of support from black people.
In 1839 the building was badly damaged by fire, but as Tar' Johnson's Members were preparing to rebuild it, they were ordered to be struck with steel.
F. David Johnson, son and successor of Tat'Johnson in St. Martin's, called the steel beating "pockets."
A professional instrumentman, who struck them, called it another way: "A cultural treasure" or "a historical instrument which will never be replaced."
This scholar, Tiffany Nq of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first time in the world if the metal instrument was played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the Lordside Church with a heavy iron set 18 years ago.
Mr. Merlyweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
The main feature here in St. Martin's for the past few months has been the work of drafts and builders, some of whom have been called de-ductive church leaders, some of whom are the Rabbey churches.
A congregation - governing body, made up of nonteachers - writes to the outside world in July, is concerned that a mob will not be responsible for the congregation, even though it has had no part in the operation of drafts and international construction crews.
Some members complained that the percentages do not count things.
A shark injures a 13-year diver to obtain lobsters in California
The officers said, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year boy on Saturday, when he was immersed to catch a lobster in California on the date of the opening of the last term for lobster.
This attack took place just before the 7 morning near Beacon's Beach in Etchitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-T TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help. Then they went swimming to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said, at first I thought it was fun for Lobster, but later "he realized that it was shouting, ‘ I’m bited! ’
‘ I am forgiven!'
This bone is below the neck on the breast, 'Hammel noticed this when he got to the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' until Hammel said.
This boy is airborne to the Lady Children's Hospital in San Diego where they are in critical condition.
What kind of shark remains him is not known.
In a matter of news, the shark had been seen there for weeks, but it was said that it was not a dangerous form of shark.
Giles adds that the victim is seriously injured in the body above.
The officers have closed the sea from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Kannitas for 48 hours to check for proof of safety.
Giles says there are more than 1535 sharks in the area, but most of them are said to be harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to move its products to the UK installation market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by having stores that have makeup and professional people to help.
As an important way to enter the UK's cosmetics market to make as much as £2.8bn, which continues to grow while fashion and household products are down, these large tracts with makeup will be tested at 11 stores throughout the country, and will be available in more stores the next year if they do well.
Investment is created because these stores want to use empty shelves after they are charged with TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's will double its production of cosmetics to 3,000, including names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw.
Already, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and But's Bees, will have more space to place them in places with such names as stores like Boots.
The store will also inform the Boutique repair products so that many will be more suitable for people who don't eat meat — something that new buyers desperately need.
Also, the merchant of spicesy Fragrance Shop will test the requirements for the two stores in Sainsbury's, the first opened at Croydon, south of London, this past week and the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, over the course of the year.
Shopping online even though people now buy little food a day at a nearby store, this requires that large stores do more to encourage people to go to them.
Mike Cope, director of the Sainsbury's chief executive, said, these stores will look like big stores with various products, as they are trying to fight expensive stores such as Aldi and Ldl for more services and other non-food products.
Sainsbury's puts the properties of Argos in many stores and starts with Habitts because they have bought them both over the past two years. This has increased the purchase of food and bought them for profit.
Efforts at the original firm to improve the anoints and medical facilities have been unsuccessful.
His Sainsbury's tried to meet Boots in the early 2000s, but they broke apart after fighting in a way that could divide the drug market profits from its stores.
This new strategy was developed after the Sainsbury's sells Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, its 281 drug company at £125m, three years ago.
It says Lloyds will also take part in this project, by increasing the high - quality braking products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy at four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of commerce at Sainsbury's, said: "We have altered the appearance of our passports to improve our customers.
We have invested funds in our newly trained hands so that they can give advice.
The various products we have are designed to be suitable for each need, making it a point where it is readily available, is now an interesting place of makeup and that is not the same as the old method of shopping.
Peter Jones's anger' because Holly Willoughby has stopped the £11million business
Peter Jones noted in Dragons Den has left 'angered' after System Administrator Holly Willoughby stopped the £11million industry of life - products to deal with new agreements with Marks and Spencer and TV.
Willoughby has no time for their products of household products and decorations such as Truly.
This couple's business was similar to the Gwyneth Pattrow's Goop product.
The driver of the This Morning program, who has 37, has put it in the Instaggram that he is moving.
Holly Willoughby left the famous Dragons" Den, Peter Jones angry that he left the last minute of the industry industry - to monitor his new connections with Marks & Science and TV.
The sources say that Jones was "angered" when the important girl on TV agreed to a hot Tuesday meeting at her Business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, if her new contracts - reaching £1.5 million - makes her less time to pay attention to household products and decorations such as Truly.
This business is compared to the product Gwynth Packrow's Goop and has earned twice as much money as Willoughby's estimated £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, was putting in the Instaggram to abandon Truly, Jones went to one of his vacation homes in Britain.
The source said: "Truly has been the most important thing for Holly.
It is worth his time behind him for the next ten years.
The decision to leave her alone is a personal one.
No one believed what had happened on Tuesday, close to the celebration.
There is a store that is full of items at Marrow HQ ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the Third Morning broadcaster, among the highly affluent in Britain, may cost the company millions of millions of dollars because of the growing power of these products from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and things that could delay its development.
And this may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s three mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
'Willooughby established Truly with Carpp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
These two go on vacation together, and Jones has 40 percent of its share in the Baldwin's television company.
Willoughby will be the agent of this M&S calendar and will take the place of Ant Mcpartlin as pilot of the TV program I'm A Celebrity.
The source near Jones said last day "We will not talk about his business."
We said, ‘ We just fell in love ’
She has made a mockery of criticism in the press by saying what some consider to be "disease" and speaking well of a North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such sacrifices?
Trump said in his mortification of the "substatic" channel on this subject.
"I don't deny anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in seeing them again after the first contact in Singapore in June with Trump’s hat as a major step toward the elimination of nuclear war in North Korea.
But the Nuclear Non - Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty has ended.
More than three months after the June conference in Singapore, North Korea’s senior officer, Ring Ho, told world leaders of the United Nations on Saturday of the House of Eye, which says that the North cannot see the "a similar answer" from the United States to North Korea with anti-armage measures.
Rather, he said that the United States continues its target.
Trump has given him a hope for the talk that he gives him at his party.
"We are doing well with North Korea," said.
"We fought against North Korea."
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we are very close.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim and that with good results the testing of submarines, they have given the victims freedom and returned American bones.
And she has protected her against the unusual way in which she deals with Kim.
"It is very easy to be the president, rather than the 10,000 people outside who are trying to enter the crowded stadium, we would have about 200 people standing here," Trump pointed to the crowd standing right in front of him.
The Indonesian Tsunami and Nikima destroy the Island, killing hundreds of people
After an earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign agencies were told that they were not needed.
Even though 10 percent of the Lomboks have been removed from the area, the area has not been described as a place of disaster, resulting in a world aid.
"Unfortunately, in most cases, they have made it clear that they are not asking for world assistance, so this is a challenge," Mrszn Sumbung said.
While Save the Children includes a group to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign workers can work there.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the country’s disaster center, said that Indonesian officials surveyed Palu to see if the world agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
As a result of an earthquake that has regularly swept through Indonesia, the country is not always ready for an earthquake.
While tsunami shelters are being built in Aceh, they are rare offshores.
The absence of a tsunami in Palu, despite warnings, may have contributed to death.
Even in relatively minor periods, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel extremely difficult.
A hospital ship left Lombok for treatment of earthquake victims to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widdo gave priority to improving Indonesia’s deteriorating development foundations when cutting down on electoral support, and he has spent a lot of money in repairing railways and railways.
But poor funding has taken on Mr. As it will be reemerged in the next year.
Mr. Joko is faced with the pressure of a sectarian conflict in Indonesia, where many Muslim members have been involved in the most critical of this service.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their homes as groups of Christians and Muslims fight in the streets with clubs, spears, and helmets, as well as other dangerous weapons.

Cromwell’s photograph is the last one to be caught by a conflict of “registration of history ”
The removal of them will be the justice of the elements because of her destruction, such as Tabalan in many of England’s traditional and religious images by his zealous Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell described the advice of Mr Crick as "foolishness" and "try to record history again."
▪ John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It would be inevitable that in this discussion it is by removing images of the image from the image of the Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
The destruction of images in English wars was never ordered or caused by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell will be paid for the actions of his great - grandfather Thomas of the first century.
The outstanding way in which Sir William Hamo Thornycroft described Cromwell is the evidence of the 19th century and part of the history of many who still think his life should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told you The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than at present, as a protector of parliament against external pressures, largely in his case from the imperial point of view.
Whether this description is correct depends to a large extent on the ongoing debate in history.
The fact is that the dispute in the mid-17th century has influenced the next development of our country, and Cromwell is a person who has taken a stand for the same side of the conflict.
What they accomplish as the Lord Security must be observed and remembered.
A Deadly Pig Attacked by a Chinese Farmer
A farmer has been attacked by pigs at a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
A man, described only by his figure "uuuan," was found wanting with a broken vein, covered with blood near the pigs in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pigs farm is preparing to milk his pigs in the hags on May 30, 2005, in Xining Province in Qinghai, China.
It is said that he was accompanied by his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan district on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and he found that the door to the nearby herd was open.
There, he says, was a large bull that had blood in his mouth.
Fusion research confirmed that the zebra’s 50-pounder weight caused her death, according to the report.
"The man's legs were bloody and round," said the cousin whose name is "Wu," as quoted by Guinginging Evening News.
Security cameras showed Yuan entering the market by 4.40 am on Thursday feeding pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The tiger took Yuan away, not his own, or his cousin.
The manager of the shopping mall told Evening News that the pig had been locked to keep it from attacking others, while the police had gathered the evidence at the slum.
the household of Yuan, and the authorities of the market, it is said, that they have talked with each other about his death.
Though rare, it is the situation in which pigs are recorded in early contact with humans.
In 2016, the pig attacked a naked man and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, a man of serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 600-weight zebra caught Welsh farmer on a tractor until his wife drove the pig away.
After a Oregon farmer had eaten his pigs in 2012, one of Manitoba's farmers told the CBC News that the pigs were not angry but their taste of blood could cause them to do so.
Be casual.
They are sharp - eyed, guards over you... have no intention of harming you.
You have to give them a suitable cause, you say.

In the meantime, the political state is still under way, with a broadcast that interrupts the process of a fifth practice to change at the last minute: a treaty made by the Sen of Arizona by Jeff Flake so that the FBI will conduct one week's investigations in a court case.
Ford told the Senate Committee to make sure it was 100 percent that Kavanough placed his finger under the influence of alcohol and tried to free him from the high school party.
Kavanaugh, in physical evidence, said he was sure 100 percent that it did not happen.
It is not uncommon for more than 20.4 million people to watch the report by Nelson on Friday.
The company counted the number of followers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC news.
The numbers did not exist at this time to appear on other networks, including PCS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And nielsen is in desperate need of measuring people who have seen in office.
To put it this way, the size of the followers is the same as when watching the finish line in a soccer match or the Study Awards.
The Fox Channel of the News, which, in view of its having a system to support the election of Kavanough in power, leads all the other network by having followers at the rate of 5.69 million per day, says Nielsen.
ABC was in the second position with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had -2.94 million, the MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.

"Do you think you are true to the world?
He was told, "You are strong when the majority of the detectives are weak."
Flake had her office released the compartment and said that, before the bridge closed, she had much to say to the counsel committee.
with broadcasts and cables all at the moment of the following hours, while the Governing Body would vote to continue the election of Kavanough on the full vote.
But Flake says he will only do it in accordance with the FBI where he will look for charges against the election of the next week, where the Democrats are only a few groups that were advised.
Flake has advised this by speaking to her relative, I Democratic generator Chris Coos.
After a discussion with the Coons and other satellites, Flake has made a decision.
Flake’s choice is strong, for there is evidence that the Republicans do not vote in favor of Kavanauh without investigation.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation to investigate the charges brought against Kavanough.

Unless they are able to control the extensive election of the provinces during the past December, the National Pro-independence teams of Catalan have been reluctant to maintain that situation this year because their best-known leaders have kept themselves in exile or under police custody awaiting a trial due to the role they played in the pursuit of freedom.
Joan Puig, an 42-year-old contractor who has recorded a proposal to support the police on his telephone, had a conflict influenced by the politicians on both sides.
"It's even more serious."
Saturday, Oril Junqueeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in front of a prison trial at the end of last year, announces that he will take part in the election of the Europa Parliament next year.
"If it is a choice in the European election, it is the best way to criticize the extent of furthering the behaviour of freedom and control we have already seen from the Spanish government," says.

An attempt to insert an article that gave Livingston 1-0 and succeeded in Rangers
The first article of Dolly Menga and victory in Livingston
The promotion of Livingston shocked the Rangers by passing by Steven Gerrad on just twice the 18 games to be made by the Ibrex director of the club.
Dolly Menga's attack player has confirmed as the difference as the Gary Holt's side has increased the level with the Hiberian in a second.
The Garrard's side is already unable to succeed in the Premiership games on this left-handed and facing the Heats leaders, who drew them by eight points, on the next Sunday.
Earlier, the FRangers had met Rapid Vienna in the European League of Europe by the Sine.
Livingston, in the meantime, reported their failure level to the section for six games, where the principal instructor Holt was about to taste the victory since he had replaced Kenny Miler in the past month.
Livingston lost the chance of unwanted visitors
The Holt group should have been leading before the articles were introduced, in the direct manner that causes the Rangers to have all types of problems.
Scott Robinson has noted that to draw your efforts in the face of the article, Alan Lithgow may not point directly to his efforts to open up after entering
Restaurants have been pleased to see Rangers play in front of them, knowing that it would cause problems for their favorite guests.
And that is how it comes to an important subject.
The Rangers have received the free kick and Livingston worked with opening, the Declan Gallagher and Robinson being joined by setting Menga, who has touched the ball to place a point from the middle of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers were the most likely to hold the ball, but they found that the insurance was strong and that the middleman Liam Kelly was not trouble free.
The wheelchair has continued in the second half, though Alfonso Morelos forced the ball out of Kelly.
Scott Pittman has been ordered at the feet of Allan McGregor a gangster of the Rangers and Lithgow who has thrown ball from one of Livingston's players.
Crossballs continued to come to the Livingston bridge and continued to be clarified, while there were two Pensels after the test by Halket's successor of Glen Middleton, one was the Handball.
A "A Miracle" from Livingston-Communication.
Scotland’s BBC, Alaskan Lamont, Tony Macaloni Arena
Playing with the marvelous decks and the outcomes of Livingstone.
To the man. They were outstanding, they continued to highlight all that was expected of the proposed route ahead.
Their play and control have rarely changed since they returned from the standard aircraft, but their reputation is given Holt in the way he has shaped the team sport as ever he has reached.
He had many powerful men.
The gang leader Halket had a hull, running a subbly-project for a license, while Menga kept the Conor Goldson and Joe Worral in their short statures all the time.
The Rangers were in need of encouragement.
Although they have been very good at certain times under the rule of Gread, they have fallen short along the decks.
Their last ball was just a failure in which they cut out their home-up left-and that is a trigger in the egg of the Rangers, which they found to be at the center of the table.
Eldogen received a mixed reception in Cologne
It was full of smiles and blues on Saturday (29 September) as leaders of Turkey and Germany assembled in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of the visit of President Erdogan that can be opposed in Germany that is aimed at repairing the connection between the NATO connections.
It is more than a matter involving human rights, the freedom of newspapers and the Turkish treaty in the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a large moque.
The city is home to most of the Turks again.
Police have explained reasons for security to prevent 25,000 strong people from meeting before themosque, but most of the supporters have come nearby to see their president.
Hundreds do not go along with the Erdogan public-most of them are Kurdish-and caused their voices to be heard, destroying the operation of the police and German government so that the national government will accept them.

The Hurricane Rosa interrupts Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City by flooding (the drought areas can benefit from flooding.
Tropical pressure rarely attacks Arizona, but that may happen directly at the beginning of the next week as Hurricane Rosa remains able to travel through the South East Coast, which presents the dangers of high-water flooding.
The National Weather Service has already dedicated equipment to observing flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and east of Navada, in southern California and Utah, including the following cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct route to Phoenix on the second, which will bring rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has written that only 10 tropical petals stored in a troping storm or at a level of pressure in the Phoenix for 200 miles since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was not a torpedo within 40 miles of AZ.
The recent model of the National Hurrican Institute has estimated rainfall from 2 to 4 inches, with a single-ile number to 6-inch in Arizonalogon Rim.
In some areas of the Southwest Desert including the centre of Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, and their solitary wanderings to 4 inches if possible.
In these flood dangers Rosa’s rain can be a blessing as it surrounds us with drought - stricken areas.
Although water flow is very important, some rainfall is wasted because Southwest suffers from drought at this time.
According to the U.S. Starvation of drought, more than 40 per cent in Arizona have a severe drought problem, which is the second highest level. Weather.com
First, the Hurricane Rosa leads to the land across the Baja region of California Peninsula of Mexico

Rainfalls in Mexico can be very heavy, affecting just the risk of flooding.
" Rainfall is a total of 3 to 6 inches expected from Baja California to the western edge of Sonora, to 10-inch, of ather.com, report.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a troping storm before reaching the Arizona board at two o'clock in the morning, such as the tropical pressure, which will then take us up to Arizona and southern Utah at two o'clock in the evening.
"The leading danger for Rosa or fregons is heavy rainfall at Baja in California, northwestern Sanora, and U.S. Desert of Southwest," says the Hurrican State Center.
These rains are expected to bring forth heavy rain along the dry riverbed as well as to the desert rivers, the terraces, to the mountainous terrain.

Trump said that Kavanough's harassment, cruelty, and wrath's Democratic Paty
"The Judge Kavanough vote is the vote to destroy the cruel and shameful ways of the Democratic Party," says Trump in the Garelly in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanough's pain, cruelty, and wrath's Democratic Paty in her choice system.
Kavanaugh gave a witness before the Tribunal of the Sine, forcing and emotionally charged the charge of sexual abuse by Christine Blackey Ford ten years ago.
Ford also gave evidence of his accusations.
The President said on Saturday "The Americans saw an inspiration, intelligence and cost" in Kavanough on this date.
"The vote to assure Judge Kavanough is the vote to ensure the completion of free-minded minds of our time, a juri with a suitable record of public services, and to inform a multitude of West Virginia's supporters.
The President referred to the random selection of Kavanough while speaking about the importance of the election results in the second half of the Republic.

Hundreds of Indonesia are killed by an earthquake, the seemingly self - rising Tsunami
At least 384 people were killed, many were swept away by the surf, where a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a party in Palu Sea on Friday, where the waves were six feet [6 m] high (18 feet] high in the dry ground, wiped out people because they killed many people and destroyed anything in their path.
The tsunami follows 7.5 jignits.
"While the tsunami promised the appearance of yesterday, people were doing their duties at sea and did not immediately run away and were the victims," Sutopo Puro Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Minister of the BNPB Service spoke to him when he gave a comment on Jakarta.
"The tsunami has never gone out alone, to drag motors, bars, houses, towing everything on earth," says Nucroho, adding that the tsunami had gone through the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before it reached the shore.
Some climb up trees to avoid tsunamis and survive, so to speak.
About 6,700 people have been moved from their homes to 24 Palu centers.
The Aerial photograph was issued by the agents of emergency services that have already shown many buildings and shops destroyed by tsunamis, pre-submarine and fallen bridges and swamped mosques.
The tsunami’s fruitage continued to move the city’s coastline on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes are concentrated in areas of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Integrity Agent of the Test of Technology (BPT) said that in its speech the largest earthquake was 200 times greater than the nuclear explosion cast at Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The state of science in the City, which lies at the end of the length, the closing of the harbor, may increase the size of a tsunami, the saying.
Negroho described the damage as a big "and has been described by thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels in ruins.
The bodies of some victims are covered in a hole below the level of the damaged buildings, they say, and they are said to be 240 persons injured and 29 are still invisible.
Nucroho has said that the victims and damage could be as much as 200 miles [300 km]) to the North North of Palu, in an area called Dongga, which is near the epicenter of an earthquake.
The link was completely paralyzed with no details" from Dongga, and Nigroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, said the Red Cross in their speech, added that their crew and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it can be more," he said.
The Ministry on Saturday was criticized in the country for not letting up a tsunami in Palu, although the officers came with a wave at the time of the release of warning.
Photos have been shared with some of the people who are in the media in which a man was above the heard building deck and sounded a desperate warning when a tsunami reached the people and the streets.
Within minutes the water wall has hit the shore and taken the buildings and motors out of the way.
The Reuters could not move the image immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused great electric power to break up the link in the Palu area and have made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue missions.
Forces have begun sending vehicles and aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities have said, but those discharged from their homes have been desperately in need of food and other necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for only the purpose of helping together and will remain closed until October.
Mongali Yoko Wedador was arranged to visit the services of those who had been moved to a religious building in Palu.
The All Soars of Indonesia for Tsunami are more than 800.
Some of the Biggests.
While the Dongga World Vision staff in Dongga are safe in the city of Pallu, where the workers are housed in the offices of their offices in Tarpaulin, they are past the traumatic events of their environment, says Mr.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
Too bad
And like rescue groups who begin to express strong feelings of relief, some complain that some of the world’s high - tech aid workers have been banned from Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, financial support, staff and work personnel from overseas can only begin to travel if a disaster site is declared as a place for national disaster.
That's not yet done.
"It is a disaster in the province," says Aulia Arriani, the speaker of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"The President once said, "A GOOD., this is a State disaster," we can open it to the World but still have no degree at present.
As it was the second night in Palu after the fifth earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the former family still hoped that friends and relatives would appear and that this miracle would leave an unsaid story about natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was released from the uniform.
In a convenient way the rescuers rescued a woman who had been caught in a flame for two days and found the mother’s body in her guilt.
Gemon Subandono, an instructor of the Indonesian national team of paragliding, trained the two paragliding paradings that are on this invisible team preparing the Asiatic games, which are scheduled at the beginning of this coming month in Indonesia.
Some who had been locked in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandag, were his disciples.
‘ Like paraglidingfield, I have feelings that are a burden to me,' says.
Mr. Gendon has re-counted the way, in the hours following the falls of the Hotel Roa Rome and traveling among the people who have been traveling on paragliding, who have been busy sending whatsapp messages to the Panulu competitions, and who have been taking part in the navy.
His messages, however, are limited only to the gray character, instead of having two corresponding characteristics that indicate reading of the message.
"I think this means that the messages were not sent," I said.

West: Irapper has changed its name to "Ye.
Rappper's musician Kane West has changed his name to Ye.
Commenting on his change of name, he wrote to Twitter on Saturday, saying: "Usually you've been known as One West."
The West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and has been using Moniker as the title of his eight-discover, which has gone out of hand.
These changes took place before he appeared in the Light Live on Saturday, where he was expected to complete his new edition of Yandi.
You have entered the site of a musician Ariana Grande who has resigned for her "for her reasons"," says the songwriter.2]
Since this is an adjusted term in a modern legal term, West declared long ago that the name has an important role in religion to him.
"India believe 'he' is the most common and widely used name in the Bible, which in the Bible is "you,", the West said that earlier this year, when discussing the title of his record and DJ radio Big Boy. is the host partyed over in the Bible.
"I am all, I am you, I say,
He put it on Cain, that he alone is to Him; for we are a sign of good things, of our confusion, of everything.
The disc is a more accurate indication of what this is.
One number of famous lappers has changed the name.
Sean Combs have been known by these terms by different names, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year she chose to be named by Love Bishops.
A former singer with West, JAY-Z, her name was also written in large letters with or without bearing.
Mexico's AMLO had promised that he would not serve the forces against the population.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use civil security forces as the country has reached the 50th anniversary of the injury and non-resultation of students.
Lopez Obrrador promised on Saturday at Tlatolco Plaza that "he will never use the festivals to oppress the Mexicans."
The forces started shooting in a show of organized plastic in Oct. 2, 1968, killing more than 300 people during the student-based classes in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youths by giving them monthly support to the literacy classes and by opening many open universities to mankind.
He claimed that the absence and failure of educational opportunities made young people more likely to join gangs.
The U.S. has doubled the A.I financial support.
China is becoming more active in non-financial intelligence, the U.S. must repeat the time spent in the research section, says the sponsor with the AI practicationer Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These commissions will come after various sections of the U.S. government have made announcements for AI, and such as the U.S.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan this past year: it was intended to be No.1 on the AI plan in 2030.
‘ The repetition of an AI research college will be a good start, as all the other countries behind the U.S., and look at the next design of the AI," says Lee.
Repeating funding may multiply the probability of the next major success of the AI to be done in the U.S., says Lee in an interview with the CNBCs this week.
Lee, author of the book "China Power: China, Silicon Valley, and New World Order" are published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harbor, CEO of the Signation Ventures, which supports one of China's largest AI companies, Face+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon was employed on the AI program that struck the most prominent American nobleman Othello Galyer, who was the manager of the Microsot Research Survey, and former head of Google at the China branch.
Lee has accepted the latest competition for U.S. government technology as a Robot of the High Security Project Project and asked when it will occur next, to determine the following understanding.
U.S. researchers have to work hard to win government financial support, says Lee.
"It's not China to take over the leadership of education; it's a unified body," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technical companies hire qualified university personnel to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that the change of foreign travel police may help to support its AI efforts
"I think the green card will be given automatically to those who make PhD's in the "AI", I say.
The National Council of China issued its Declaration of Tacticality in the Next Generation in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation of the Environment provides the financial support for students in the same educational institutions as does the National Institute of Natural Science and other public institutions that contribute money to U.S. researchers, but the level of education is less than China, says Lee.
Early this year in the U.S. Department of Security established a Non-Influence Center, which was designed to involve cooperative groups from the product to education, and the White House announced the establishment of the election of an Optical Committee.
And this month the DARPA introduced $2 billion as the beginning of a trial called AI next.
As NSF, it now has more than $100 million a year for research on the AI.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation intended to create the National Security Commission in Non-Neminality has not yet begun these months.
The Macedonians have voted into repherenduum to change the name of their country.
The Macedonians opted for repherendum in Sunday to change the name of the country into the "Ecedonian Northern Province," an act that will settle the old dispute over the age of ten and broken members to call values to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, wants its territory in the Northern Hemisphere to have its place and closes the entrance to NATO and the EU.
Two governments have signed a contract on June based on the request for a new name, but the Nationalists object to a change of the term that they say undermines the origin and culture of the majority of the Macedonian's Slavs tribe.
President Gjoge Ivanov said that he would not vote for referendom and the company that refused to cooperate are not sure that the candidates would meet the requirements for gathering the 50% of the minimum required to carry out the recommended referundum option.
The question on the refeminum's polling bill reads: "May you be a member of NATO and EU that accepts a concordion with Greece."
Promoters of word replacement, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth it to make adoption on such boards as the EU and theito of Macedonia, which are one of the countries to meet at the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came here to vote the future of this country, making it possible for young people here in Macedonia to be able to stay free under the protection of the European Union, for that would mean a safe life for all of us," says Olivera Georgijovska, 79, Skopje.
Although not legally binding, members of parliament have said that they will commit themselves to the outcome of the vote so that they can make it necessary. 2]
The change of the name will require two thirds of the parliament.
The election commission of the country said there were no unusual reports on 1 p.m.
Nevertheless, the present people stood 16 per cent, compared with 34 times the previous 2016 election of Parliament, where they were 66 percent of the votes.
"I am here to vote for my children, our place in Eurpe," said Gjose Tanevski, who had 62, and who would have been in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia for a change in terms of the term which would open the way to join the NATO and European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before parliament at Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov, of 54, repaired a small platform and dragged the chairs that had been set up against the reef.
"We are NATO and EU, but we want to join actively, not according to door services" says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but are virtuous.
If they don't want to accept it as Macedonians, we can convert countries such as China and Russia into part of the European-Asian union.
The Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO will bring up the most needed growth in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 per cent.
‘ I believe that many people will like that because there are more than 80 percent of the people who like Nato and the EU, I believe," says Zave after vote on the bar.
He said that the "Yes" would be the result of "securing our future."
List of votes will be printed on the last Monday by the Macedonian Police Research Center between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of votes who will participate in refinendum-below the number required for the vote to be successful.
One list of votes, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, has been found 57 percent of the people who have planned to vote on Cape Town.
The majority of participants in these areas are about 70 percent of them who will vote "Yes."
For the election to be effective, it requires 50 per cent and one person more to vote.
The failure of sonorendom will bring the first powerful blow to the pro-Western federal police since its taking of the rope in May last year.

Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling had taken the Brighton player in Manchester City where she won 2-0 on Saturday on Etihad in Manchester Street, England.
Aguero made it easier for him to put the article in 65 minutes.
A attacking Argentinean athlete received a passing ball from a bow player when they started the sequence.
They were running between the three Brighton Guards, before giving way to the open field.
Aguero has found himself surrounded by four green shillings.
He has pushed another safety player before running and running from time to time at the end of the Brighton box box.
Then he pushed the ball across his left side, hurling at Sterling.
England's chief fan used his first touch in the box to hand the ball again to Aguero, who has used his right shaft to strike the Brighton Manaw Ryan with the Shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has had some problem on his foot," City Minister Pep Guardola told the news.
"We talked with him about his play for 55, 60 minutes.
Here is what happened.
We were fortunate to put the article at this moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first chance to fight for himself in the Premier League.
That article is then the 29th minute.
Aguero has obtained a wide ball from the Brighton ground in this game.
He sent a fine ball to the left Frank Leroy Sane.
Sane has just taken a few toys before jumping to Sterling.

Scherzer wants to play on Spoleer vs. Rockies
when making a Nationalisation on a balloff conflict, there was no reason to force a re-starting.
But Sherzer, who has always held a contest, hopes to find an elevated location on Sunday when playing with the Colorado Rockies, but only when results have been drawn on the Rockies bats, which manages the lead level in the Los Angeles Dodlers in the West of the NL.
The Rockies have completed a little with a row-card post where they graduated on 52 Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking at their tag in the first section.
"Although we are not playing to find something, at least we can place the thumb in the rubber knowing the nature of the Denver state and the audience and other groups in any high-level point that I can face this year.
Why don't I argue?
Nationals have already announced that they begin with the Sunday, but they have received an encouraging report so that Schcherzer could speak in such a case.
Scherzer, who will begin in 34th class, has done a bullpen session on Thursday and will be doing her normal rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 and 2.53 TER 300 strikeots in 220/3 of the innings on the sea.
Trump trucks in West Virginia
The President referred in no uncertain terms to the person he had selected in the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the discharge of the Republican votes with the medieval choice.
"All that we have done can be lost in November.
The remaining five weeks before this historic election are very important in our time.
This is a big choice, largely "runners" and I really don't run, that is what I am everywhere struggling to find the right kind of people to defend," says.
Trump went on to say, "When you see the bad things of the Democrats gang, you see them happening right now.
And they are determined to take over their authority by using whatever means seem appropriate, cruel, inhuman.
The indifferent mind and whoever has hurt them, who will go over them, to gain power to control and control, and that only what they need in power to control, we will not give them this."
The Democrats, he said, are in a position on a mission to "respons and interrupt."
"You saw what happened four days ago," said, calling the Democrats "because of the anger of cruelty and coldness and dissipation."
He is referring to the Senate Committee on the Democratic Star of Democratic Dianne Feinstein by his name, where he has received greetings from onlookers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you moved in?
Uh, h, what is it.
No, no, I'm waiting for the other – it's so bad that I've never seen anything like the body.
Her special mother, Labour, was full of details.
It is not easy to communicate with such ones what they think
While the Momentum's activists in my local group voted against me, it was a surprise.
After all of that, I am the top of the Labour's MPs to be told that they are not all expressing what they are thinking.
My friend Joan Ryan received similar treatment from me when she proudly opposed the Jews.
In my case, the situation of criticism and opposition to me is my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
To the important police of the working economic system, to the national security, Europe, by attacking similar issues where Jeremy disagrees with former leaders.
The Public Meeting Notice Nottingham East Court was dated on Friday and wrote that "We want the meetings to be included and have a proper effect."
For nearly eight years I have been the local MP for Labour, the five GC conferences on the 5th day have been the same.
Where it is bad today, this modern meeting is not a good assembly that usually has "human and soft," the political party is forgotten or, however, never started again.
It seems that an increasing variety of opinions differing from accepted in the Labour group and that the whole opinion is examined before being accepted in the polling team.
This began after Jeremy entered the leadership seat, as did my former fellow worker and me, with the idea of sharing a similar political outlook with him and who was expected to change quickly and take sides that I would not agree with; either by national security or trade or even by one of the EU.
Whenever I talk out-and I don't care about what to follow the harassment on the pages of communication is said to be lowered on the seat, not to be accepted by the local politics, I'm told I shouldn't be in the Lavour party.
And that is my experience.
Likewise, I know that I am more fortunate than my workmates as the courts bring me face - to - face and want to become political activists.
I respect the arts and commitments of my colleagues who are faced with daily sexual or racial harassment but who can’t take them away from them.
One of the most controversial features of this world is politics.
Jeremy Corbyn explained this past week that the Labour team had adopted a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that it is no longer the major and by a form of "mutchy" or by changing the principles of the group that have become ungovernable.
I have many suggestions over the past two years that ask me to let go, not to speak of the way I talk, and then "all is good."
But this is no longer the political act.
Since I joined Labour in 32 years as a school child, being incited by the Thachcher government to ignore the room in which I had been studying, since then I have vowed to fight for the best of the public and those who need it, especially if I were a consummate or a minister of the government.
I did not hide my involvement in politics, including the previous election.
No one in the East of Nottingham can be confused by any way about my position in my police, and in the areas where I disagree with current leaders.
In these high conditions now on Friday, in all cases when Brexit influenced you in houses, businesses and our public services, I don't understand his desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leaders of the Body.
But the real thing is that the same message I have does not go to Nottingham Momum, to my people, whether they are members of Labour or theirs: I am proud of your working under you and I promise that there is no price for the terrors or political aid that will prevent me from doing what I believe are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr going ahead
The two latter sets to the final conclusions that nearly led to the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr is worthy of such a fine victory for the Tennet's Premiership Day celebration.
Now they increase the rate, the main part of the division.
Finally, it was their high - quality protection, as well as their opportunity to take a better chance, which led to the betrayal of the family side and the trainer Peter Murchie.
"We have been tested in our games up to now, and we are not beaten, therefore I must be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose, says: "Request Ayr, do better than we have done."
Grant Anderson was 14 minutes in his try, changed by Frizier Climo, and put Ayr ahead, but, Scottish Scottish cap card card by Rory Hughes, released by the Warriorers, allowed Melito to make notes and Jason Baggot to try to change them.
Climo outlined the leadership of Ayr with thepenty, before, the half-time game, you installed an article and then changed that try to make 17-5 on Ayr at rest.
However, Melrose has started well half and the Patrick Anderson' route, which was converted by Bagogot, reduced the opportunity of five points.
It has been said that long since Ruaradh Knot, who has suffered from bouts of bouts, Ayr has advanced rapidly with the Stafford McDowell, translated by Climo.
Ayr's arresting Captain Blair Macpherson has been given a yellow card, and again, Melrose has fined another man with Bruce Colvine's untranslated truck, under great pressure.
However, when the Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card because of hanging Climo without a ball line, MacPerson went to bed behind as the Ayr caught her.
Climo has changed, as it has almost since it was started again, after Kyle Rowe had packed David Armstrong's balls into the box and sent the flamefor Henry until he had put the fifth tire.
The Still Game Registry seems to be focused on a new project in the field of the
Still Game Secretary Ford Kieran seems determined to be in the reception section after it was found to be set up as the manager of an interinternet company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, and another professional professional in humoring Greg Hemphill.
The two have already explained that the next 9rd row will be the last to conduct the scene, and it seems that Kimeran is preparing to do something else after Craigang.
According to the official record, he is the ruler of the Adriftmorn Limited.
This player has not wanted to mark this article, although the Scottish Sun source has said that Kimeran wants to enter the "good evening deal" in Glasgow.
Our sea: Bolivia which is closed to the earth to hope that along the road will open a road to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the bustling metropolis of La Paz.
Public ceremonies send a blue flag.
The navy's masts from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have collapsed with the words: "Our Sea."
To regain it is our duty.
Throughout Bolivia's closed world, the memories of Chile's coast in the war of great wealth in the 19th century are still etched in mind - as well as in the desire to go back to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes have been much higher over the centuries, as Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the world’s legal court on October 1 after five years of debate.
" Bolivia has power, spirit of solidarity and stability, and wait for a good outcome," says Roberto Calladilla, Bolivia's ambassador.
Many people in Bolivia will hear the judgment of the World’s Constitutional Court on large exhibits throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand near Bolivia’s for four decades after being heard again and again in Chile, obliged to think of giving Bolivia a beautiful land into the sea.
Evo Morales, a life - and - descent president of Bolivia who is faced with a severe reelection year - also has much to do with the Monday sentence.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean," and confirm what it says near the end of August.
But some analysts are not likely to make such changes if a court of law on the side of Bolivia - aveno will not be able to do so.
The United Nations Committee located in the Netherlands-has the power to remove Chile's land, and has said that he cannot know the results of speech that can be achieved.
The fact that the judgment of the Earth’s Constitutional Court was issued only six months after the discussion indicates that the case was "without doubt," says Piz Zárate, a Chilean legalist.
And instead of supporting Bolivia’s desires, it might take four years to reverse them.
"A matter of sea access has been seized by the existing Bolivian government," said Zárate.
Morales ’ defense ended any kindness they still had in Chile, so to speak.
Bolivia and Chile will talk again one day, but it will be hard to hold discussions after this event.
These two countries have not shared in diplomatic service since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative of The Hague, has denounced the court’s decision as a strange one.
Monday will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to reveal on a new piece of friendly contact with Chile" and the opportunity for "ending 139 years of misunderstandings with benefits," says.
Calcutta has also condemned the fact that Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - using this sea phenomenon as a political party.
"Levia Bolivia will never relinquish its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," to stop as it says.
"This judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome things that happened in the past."
North Korea is confident that he will not launch nuclear weapons until he can trust the United States
Prime Minister R. Yong Ho says that his country will not separate from its nuclear weapons if he does not trust Washington.
RI was speaking on Saturday to the United Nations Constitutional Council.
He has asked the United States to follow up the promises made during a conference in Singapore among the top - among - minded leaders.
With those words, President Mike Pompio is almost ready to resume a nuclear exchange that had been left for more than three months after that of Singapore and Kim Jong Unun, from North Korea.
Ri says that the continuing rise and refusal of the United States is a proposal to bring an end to the Korean War will even cause the North to surrender.
Washington is cautious about accepting this agreement before Pyongngang takes the initiative to break free from these weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump were looking for a second conference.
But many doubt that Pyongyang is determined to abandon what the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang in the following month to prepare for the conference on Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion display shows the latest variety of hats you will see on the streets of a nearby town
If you want to increase the hats you have or want to block the sun then don't go anywhere else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne began to make a large collection of the most unusual hats of the SS19 exhibits that had fallen off the deck set in the Paris Canal Record.
The impressive hats have covered the Instaggrams this summer, and the designers have sent their startling hats to the exhibition.
Valentino's lone hat with a broad feather covers the whole head of the captain.
Some of the oversize hats included jewelry, a burly hat, and even a pinned but not intended to warm your head.
Thomas Browne, in turn, brought with him an amazing array of dates back to the time of the Nohepeni.
Many of these colorful masks have bloated lips and are much like Hannibal Lecter rather than fashionable fashions.
One hat would be as if to enter the water with a breathing apparatus and throat while the other was like a moisten of the ice cream.
And if you like fashion, you are fortunate.
People who are faced with mongoose claim that the hats may come from where you live.
These outstanding hats are on the feet of the La Bomba's, a two-footed sun hat worn by people like Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The book that made these unusual hats that had filled the connections has brought another large display of a grass bag carried off on the beach and almost as big as a person in your swimwear.
The Raffia orange bag, with the top edges of the luffia with a white - eyeed white toe, was the lead of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in the Paris Express.
The famous designer Luke Aritage has told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and coast bags reach people the next summer - as the designers have set them up' will be difficult to ignore the people who would have sought' here the most great things.'
John Edward: Vital language skills for people of the world
Scotland's private schools have a reputation for academic achievement, and this has continued in 2018 with some of the outcomes of pre- graduates' tests, which are strengthened by individuals and by the success of the team's sports, art, music and other public projects.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer a high - quality service to both students and parents.
Unique schools are trying to prepare their students for high school, private education, and social education.
As a school curriculum, which can create and equip a suitable school library, we see the available languages going on as the preferred and required courses that we choose in school.
Nelson Mandela himself said: "When you speak to a person in the language he understands, you reach his mind.
If you talk with him in his language, you reach his voice."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and mutual trust with foreigners.
From the recent results of the test, we can see that languages are high on the table at the highest level of secondary schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign-ling students have received articles on the Highward A.
data gathered, in 77 SCIS schools, indicated that 72 percent of students had received Highgrade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students received A.
This indicates that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a vital resource that children and young people surely need in the future.
Now languages, such as the study being selected, are similarly valued as STEM courses (science, chemistry, engineering and metmatics) in private schools and others.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Promotion and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons given by employers for the problem of filling positions, 17 percent are associated with the lack of language skills.
As a result, more and more language skills are needed to prepare young people for future responsibilities.
As more work opportunities require language, these are important in a united world.
Regardless of the type of employment you choose, if you learn a new language, you will likely gain experience in the future with the same capacity.
Being able to communicate with people from other lands allows one who knows many languages.
According to a UK test of You Gov, of the 4,000 adult population of the UK in 2013, 75 percent could speak another language well enough to communicate, and only French is spoken more than 15 percent, 15 percent.
That is why investment in the development of language is now important to children.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of the developing world, will equip children with a good job.
In Scotland each school will have different abilities in the language we teach.
A number of schools will concentrate on the current language of the past, while others will teach languages thought to be most important in the UK when viewed in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
No matter what your child likes, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in private schools, there are also professional teachers in this section.
Scotland’s independent schools are bent on preparing a form of education that will equip their children for the skills needed to succeed, no matter where they go in the future.
There is no denying now, in the world’s business world, that languages continue to play an important role in the future of this world, so this must be seen in education.
In fact, modern languages must be viewed as a "synthesis of the world."
The independent schools will continue to offer these choices, separation and retirement for young people in Scotland.
Il free bian this.
John Edward, Director of the Scottish School Council

Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, You Tube Channel
President Donald Trump begins his long - standing parades this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Its first five assembly of Trump was scheduled for the next week, including a visit to friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As a certificate certificate is established until he is selected to present him to the Supreme Court, Trump tries to cancel the second election support since the Republicans are in danger of losing the Congestion by Nov.
When will the Trump convention in West Virginia be held this evening, and how can you visit it online?
The Trump convention of Wheeling, West Virginia, is held for 7 p.m. ATT this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the West Virginia 'Trump convention on the cable train at YouTube.
Trump is considered to speak at the meeting of this week of the High Court members, Brett Kavanough, who is in a difficult situation because of charges of sexual misconduct being suspected of being set up for a week of confirmation while the FBI investigate.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to withstand the election of November.
As a result, the President Trump's campaign stated that these five meetings for the next week are aimed at "in the strength of volunteers and sponsors as the Republicans try to protect and increase their number in the Legal House and Legal House," says the Reuters.
‘ Control Congriss is so important to him that the president will go to as many countries as possible as we approach a busy ballroom," the speaker of Tupmp's knife didn't want to know what the Reuters had told him.
Written at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this modern fact at night can provide support from "Ohio and Pensylvania and is also known in Pittsburgh for its subjects," says West Virginia City News.
Saturday will be the second time that Trump visited West Virginia, the state section which he defeated by 40 percent over 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia’s Republican Ensigner Patrick Morrison, who travels after this election.
"It is not a good sign for Morisey that the president is obliged to turn him away for support," says Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to the Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: An American team shows that if you hunger for success you will continue to fight as if you were going to go to individual sports on Sunday.
After a three - game play, playing as the first of four players was the demand of the Ryder Cup.
The top position of any group has given the impression of the games the players believe in, and in the same competition.
So who is right now?
‘ Pay them six points and now four, I think we're going ahead," says Jordan Spieth while she went the same way that day.
Europe has taken this opportunity, in fact, 4 points over and 12 others that have not yet been verified.
The Americans, as Spieth puts it, that they feel they are doing well and that they can find a lot of interest in it, including how Spieth and Justin played well all day and the couple had three to four seconds.
Spieth has been playing well since the beginning and paid by example.
When people shout in applause at him, he puts the ball in a special position to win the game after he and Thomas were hit by two marks.
Beating a ball in a win - win hole at 15 causes people to shout the same way, telling them that the American team is not losing.
"You have to worry about your game at all," says Spiegel.
They have left behind.
18 holes to mark them.
Players with the top scores of Spierth and Thomas in the past two days by Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleet, the controversial story of the Ryder Cup
Europe’s roads make it strange for couples to have different mates and cannot do anything wrong.
"A couple called "Moliwood" is the one that didn't beat the bogy on Saturday afternoon and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Backwater on Friday morning.
That service, along with their interest, seems to be as beautiful to the masses as the church’s winners, and no other popular player can conquer Europe when the sun sets at the Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood and Mlinéri.
It is better for both to play together at the same time in different places.
The discussion of European success has not yet been apparent, however
Buba Watson and Web Simpson did the work of Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning, when he got cooperation with Alex Norn.
The Bogey and other twin-screw points along with a Spanish hole and a Mudian that they could not get out of.
On Sunday, though, no one can help you out of that hole.
Four footballs and four players enjoy watching them close up because of the cooperation of the combined community, the advice they offer, the advice they give, and how the schedule may change in a short period of time.
Europe has played better as a group until now and has led up to the last day, but four players have shown that the American team is hungry for an unlikely, especially Stestide.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will take the lead well on the last day of the Ryder Cup after four articles and four sports games have paid 10-6 Americans.
It is of interest to a couple named Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary to change the game to win the poor Tiger Woods to advance at the Gulf National in four steps.
The European case of Thomas Bjorn, seeks to overcome the cane that defeated them in Hazeltine in the past two years, defeating the American morning case by four points, winning a series of games in 311.
America did not readily accept the four games, victory in the wild, although they could not eliminate the debt.
Jim Fryk’s side requires 8 percent of the 12 individual sports to receive this privilege
Fleetwood was the first European to draw four points and be new at the same time with Munaliner, called "Molliwood" after the first weekend of the first couple winning four points when the Ryder Cup was opened.
Woods and Patrick Reed were further defeated Woods and the American henland Brysin Dechambeu in 5 and 4.
Woods, who has drawn himself to two Saturday games, showed where and where interest is but divided 19 of 29 games in four balls with four players and four players in a row.
Justin Rose has taken a break with his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and 1 in contrast with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world’s leading minister
Europe did not conquer France easily.
Three times his father, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas made a fine contribution to the Americans on Saturday.
They gained the victory by two more than 1 when playing with the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of these four four four four-parted holes.
Twice in the Ryder Cup the team returns from a division by four points to individual sports, although Fulyk’s role requires playing the win with another to win the game.
After two days in the second, the Sunday attack protected them.
The North Korea says that ‘ she will never complete her weapons before she has gained protection.
The director of an international foreign center in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that these sentences made it unreliable between America and there was no way that America could complete her Nuclear equipment when she could obtain security certificates.
Ri Yong Ho has told the board of those present to take positive steps last year, such as to stop the testing of equipment and to drop the Nuclear facilities, and to promise that we should no longer make Nuclear equipment.
"We don't see similar steps from America," he said.
"No promise from America will have any confidence in the security of our country and in this situation we will never undermine our equipment without speaking to America."
While Rin reviewing what has been said by North Korea about American refusal to complete the Nuclear armaments by subsections and then paid for the slightest measures they had taken, his report did not deny Pyongyang’s decision to complete the faulty weapons.
RR told of a joint report by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first conference between the president of the United States and the North Korean emperor who was in Singapore on June 12, when Kim offered to serve "Seclear equipment instead of Korea" while Trump promised the security of Korea.
North Korea wanted to bring an end to the Korean War of 1950-53 officially, but the American said Pyynyang should first eliminate the Nuclear armaments.
Ahington’s requests for lowering the severe international sentences facing North Korea have been refused.
"America forces "the finishing of the Nuclear instruments first" and increases the level of pressure by orders to accomplish their purpose in a forced manner, against the end of the war," says R.
"The idea that the sentences can frighten us is a false dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that these sentences increase mistrust.
RR did not mention the plans of another conference for Kim and Trump, which the American president spoke before the United Nations this week.
Rather, the minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and the South Korean emperor Mon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the team in this case of Nuclear is South Korea and not America, is it possible to complete the Nuclear equipment instead of Korea?
Even so, the speech of RI sounds different from last year, when speaking to a general U.N. conference in North Korea, which said that the targeting of North Korean flying equipment could not be avoided after "Mun. The wicked President" called Kim "man of flying instruments" who wants to kill himself.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "put utterly" North Korea, has courageously given Kim a praise for taking action to eliminate the weapons, but says that there is much more work to do and the judgments will remain far away from the Nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no fixed time for that, meaning "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures he has taken.
However, American secretary Mike Pompio told the U.N Security Council on Thursday: "The violation of the rulings of the Security Council does not continue to proceed strongly until we see the total destruction of Nuclear armaments."
The Security Council has passed sentences in accordance with North Korea since 2006 for the expense of the Pyonyang's flying equipment systems.
Pompeo met Ri over the U.N General Assembly and said that he would visit Pyynyang again for the second conference.
Pompero has visited North Korea three times this year, but his final visit has not paid off.
She left Pyynyang in July, saying that there was a progress made, but North Korea has hidden her saying she've created "the same values as the thieves."
North Korea promised to meet Monon this month so that they could break up the space of the flying Nuclear if America is a "compliance action."
Then Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" that Trump had promised in Singapore and further development in normal relations with Washington
Harvard students take adequate rest courses
A new study at Harvard University in this year enabled all undiscovered students to sleep well in order to fight the habit of learning throughout the night with caffeine.
One expert found that students at the university do not have a foundation for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep specialist at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigham and Women's hospital, conducted this study, believed that first in America.
She was encouraged by her talk about the effects of lack of sleep on the course.
'When she finished one class of her class, one girl came and said: 'Why am I told that now, am I going to finish school?'
She said that no one told me the importance of sleep - that surprised me, ’ she told The Telegraph.
This study started this year, explains the benefits of sleeping in connection with the development of education and sports, including improving their general health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a university health - education education education, said that the university decided to bring up the subject after finding students who did not sleep well.
This one - hour study involves a series of delightful projects.
In one section there is a picture of a university bedroom, where students click coffee cups, curtains, training clothes and books for the purpose of explaining the effects of caffeine and light and how sleeping insufficiently affects the development of sports.
In one section, participants are told how sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The school map, with its impressive features, encourages its participants to focus on their daily activities.
‘ We know that we will not change the conduct of the students immediately.'
However, we believe they have a right to know - as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking drums," says educator Czeisler, adding.
The tendency to be hyperactive is still present, he adds that modern technology and stress to students is a growing problem.
Maintaining adequate sleep should be an unconscious weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, and even avoiding obesity, as sleep deprivation impairs the brain, making it ever more hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old resident of California who studies in chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler make a study of the class after attending his first year in Harvard.
He says that the class opened his eyes and encouraged him to make the class available to the whole school.
He hopes that the next step will ask the regarded students to carry out the same reading program before they enter the competition center.
Czeisler advises students to think of making sleepal, and waking, as well as being aware of the dangerous effects of electric light and lED light, which can interfere with your daily routine, which can pay for sleep problems.
The Rivingston 1-0 Rangers Men of Gerrard
The Rangers also encountered a problem when playing on the way while Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrad with one point on an egg (1-0) in Livingston.
The Ibrex's side of the Ibrex was on the move for the first time after St Johnstone struck 41 February. But the Gerry Holt team struck Gerrard for the second time in an 18 game, which began to be the manager's recovery of eight points except the running team at the Ladbrokes Premiersships, the Heats.
Menga received an article a few minutes earlier before the half-time and the Rangers's players were not interested.
While the Rangers came down instead of the sixth, Livingston rose to the third after it was the Hibernian leaving it with one point.
Then there are problems coming to the Rangers after the Lienesman has been treated with head injuries after being hit by a thrown object from the side of the players.
Gerrard has changed players the number of time they have been accompanied by Ayr in a game before the last of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt continues with 11 of Livingstone's same players who made the same point at the Hearts last week and rejoices at the way his team has beaten their opponents in all manner.
The Rangers have controlled the game, but Livingstone does more while finding the ball.
He must have played the article in the second minute while the Menga player allows Scott Pittman to pass to the Alllan McGregor wheels but the middle player has not found them.
Keaghan Jacobs stole the ball found by Craig Halket, but his partner, Alan Lithgow, was able to open it up on later wheels.
The Rangers did not get power but seemed more optimistic than beliefs about the third act before the last one.
Allredo Morelos feels that he should have found a pencil in the half hour mark as he and Steve Lawles collided with each other but Steve Thomson ignored the Colombian player's cry.
The Rangers had a chance to kick the ball near the fields before the first stage of the game, but a team member of Ibrix Liam Kelly had no problem with the ball picked up by Lassana Colibaly and also by Ovie Ejaria.
When Livingstone got the first article in 34 minutes that it was difficult to find, no one would deny that it is truly worth it without any effort.
Also, the Rangers who failed to prevent Jacobs from playing soccer.
Scott Arfield did not act like the Declan Gallagher who passed a ball on to Scott Robinson, who did not have any worries in order to succeed Menga.
Gerhard made an earlier change as Colibaly introduced this change to Ryan Kent and introduced the results as soon as the player opened the door to Morelos but the famous player fled for his escape.
But Livingston has continued to make the on-going team to play what they want, and Lithgow and Halket were throwing the ball away again.
The Holt group could get an article at the start of the game, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacob before Lithgow put it on the wheels by the head.
One recent gangster, Glenn Middleton, had another case of punishment as he met Jacobs, but he too turned his back on Thomson.
Almanac: Geiger County developer
And now a page from "The Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, some 136 years ago today, and SIMPLA ... the date scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of testing and measuring radioactivity, which was developed by this development of a device known as the Geiger Couter.
Since then, the Geiger Counterter has also been used in pop culture as well, as it was shown on movies in 1950 known as "Balls of Colonao," whose curious characters are impossible to become scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
He: 'What is that?'
Rogers: "It is Geiger County, used to search for precious stones.
When you put these things into your ears, you will hear the results of Atoms produced by radioactivity.
Evans: "Speak, it really happens now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 36th birthday.
But this declaration bearing his name will live on.

A method of doing this involves releasing body cells from a patient, converting them into a laboratory until "see" conventional proteins called HER2 cancers, and reinjecting them into the body.
University lecturer Jay Berzofsky, of America's National Cancer Center, located in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have an immune system that doesn't really work."
HER2 "gives a variety of cancers." This includes breast cancer, ovaries, lung and stomach cancers, explained university lecturer Bertofsky.
The same method of defibrillating patients with "training" cancer cells for research has worked on the Leukamia headquarters.
Kane West Limits Trump's Support for Speaks, Carrying a WAGA Title, After appearing in a SNL.
Not Very Well
Kane West received no formal support during the Saturday Night Live after a summary brings praise to the American President Donald Trump and said that you had entered the election in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, Gott Town, which he sang with a cap written by Make America Great, he made a statement against Democrats and repeated with reference to Trump’s support.
"Many times when I talk to a white person when they say: "How can you love Trump?
And I say, if I were concerned about race, I would have gone long ago, I said.
SNL began its program with a video in which Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanough’s testimony before the Committee on sexual harassment claims from Christine Balley Ford.
Although not distributed, this West video is in a chat room by comedy Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock has been trying to make fun of this video for West West.
Again, West is angry to onlookers by encountering difficulties before he goes in against his hat.
"They have abused me back.
They stop, ‘ Don't enter there with the hat that you carry.'

So we," we added.
Prior to the system, this rapper informed his followers in Twitter that he had changed his name justly, saying he was known as "Blood West just now."

Kit Harrington’s Master Game of Thorns speaks of trying to make a man a dangerous way
Kit Harrington is known to carry a sword as he introduced Jon Snow to an old violent film of the HBO, Game of Thronnes.
But this 31 - year - old preacher spoke out against what many believe about this powerful man, saying that such roles make boys feel obliged to show their strength so that they can win respect.
Kit believes that ‘ learning the wrong way ’ even wondered how to deal with the problem of male aggression in the time of #Me Too, says Kit
Kit, married to his best partner in the Game of Thorns, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, has admitted that he ‘ feels difficult ’ about coping with the problem.
'I feel very hard, for my part, so long as we didn't go well in masculinity?' says.
‘ What have we taught men as they grow up, about the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television bears the responsibility for trying to make oneself a dangerous husband because of his male role models.
He adds: ‘ What is taught?
What is taught in television, and in the streets, that boys think it’s a struggle for them to become men?
What do I think is the most important question at this time?
Because there is clearly something wrong with our boys.
In the interview she even agreed that she would never play the movie again at the end of the coming summer, saying that ‘ you are finished with wars and horses'.
Since November Kit will be featured in the animated show Sam Sherpard's True West in the story of the producer of the film industry and his brother-in-law, who is a robber.
He thinks that meeting Rose is the best thing that comes from the Game of Thrones.
"I have met my wife in this manner, and thus have helped me to find my family and my life from now on," says I.
Rose was imitating Ygrette, whose boyfriend, Jon Snow, imitated Kit’s custom of winning the championships.
The couple were married in June 2018 in Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new patients
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 82,000 people were affected, say the medical authorities.
An estimated 40,000 people were affected in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
Often people are sexually affected, which is different from what is commonly used in the past.
Naturally, many people in China are affected by blood transfusions.
But the numbers of those affected in this way were reduced to total loss, say the Chinese medical authorities at the Yunnan summit.
Every year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a real problem for the LGBT communities in China.
Homosexuality is no longer a factor in China since 1997, but discrimination against the people of LGBT is said to be difficult.
Because this country has such negative views, research has made it clear that men who have sex with 70-90% will marry people.
In most cases the effects are created that are not sufficiently safe in this relationship.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised access to HIV drugs as part of the problem.
The Maxine Waters charged the information about the GOP websites issued by an employee by the custom, came out of ‘ a very heavy lie ’ and ‘ to say what is not available'
American ambassador Maxine Waters charged on Saturday that one of his employees added personal details to the Republican’s Republican nursing staff in Wipedia.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, these charges are advertised by experts and Web sites that take their side.
"A lie, a lie and a lot of lies," says Waters in the report in Twitter.
According to reports the details released are home addresses and phone numbers of these Americans. Linsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee include Orrin Hatch, Utah.
These findings appeared on the Internet on Thursday, installed by an unknown person at Capitol Hill at the time of the council’s speech about the lack of self-control and the alleged lack of justice of the High Court of Brett Kavanough.
These were released after some time after the subnets had cast off Kavanough with questions.
Wise Web sites such as the Gateway Pindit and the Red State reported that IP addresses indicate that the source of the input is from Waters office and even issued Waters' employee details, says The Hill.
"These unfounded accusations are absolutely false," adding Waters.
"A member of my staff, who is at risk because his personal information has been published because of these false charges that are not available - has no responsibility for the removal of these defects.
This groundless charge is absolutely false.
Waters' report received immediate criticism from the Internet, including the former secretary of the American president of Arischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"That indicates that he does not have the degree of being a member of the Congrress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he simply needs to get angry.
He does not have to fight.
He does not have to inquire about the accused’s motives.
Must be calm and calm.
Fleischer would be compared to Waters ’ reply and to the criticism by the Democrats of Judge Kavanough, accused by critics of being so angry with the Thursday blow.
The Omar Navarro, the Republican weeks which were not enough for the selection of Waters during the year, also announced his opinion to Twitter.
"Matter news if true this is," wrote to Twitter.
In his noise, the Waters said his office had introduced "the legitimate authorities and the law authorities on false charges.
We will ensure that the suspects are exposed," you say, "and they will pay officially for their risky actions to my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Against - The showdown of Ron Atkinsos
For days it is common to look at objects about Brexit when you watch a flashed English-related spectacle and similar to this old comedy comedy and warship, the Johnny English - derived English - from 2003 and return in 2011 as the Johnny English Reborn.
Will you tell the news that we can no longer sell foreign products?
This papal legionist named Johnny English obtained his license to renew his name for the daisies of foreign non - English observers.
It is indeed the most artistic and creative work of the State in contrast with the minority of Clousau, and Mr. Bean and at least one boy singing a piece of music in the Chariots of Fire at the opening of London's Olympics in 2012.
He even becomes a traveling companion with the world-known mystery man Atkinson, who had previously portrayed the broadcasts of the Barclaycard on television, leaving the controversy where he went.
One or two dollars at this film is indicated by the yE.
I liked this time Johnny English came to the helicopter in his old security suit while the helicopter struck his hat.
Atkinson's gift of idle humor is interesting, but it is not strong compared to the hard products such as the 007 and the Mission Amosssiny that include the current laughter.
These stories are probably directed to children and not to adults, when speaking out in my behalf, Johnny English’s laughter does not show the slightest skill compared with Atkinson’s quiet show while playing Bean
News in this video shows whether the English are in serious trouble
The Internet dweller had unwittingly entered the net in the Internet, having seen details of all the English tricks that work, until the taskmaster observed the relatively small role of Kevin Eldon.
The news goes through with a proud high - ranking high official, who is faced with a political crisis: Emma Thompson tries to do what is right as he plays Teresa May but the author of the film is not doing well when he writes it
Wise counselors tell him that, like all the aesthetics, they are at risk and are forced to return the one who has retired.
And so says the simple Englishman Johnny English himself, who has assumed the position of principal in school, but teaches classes irrespective of the nature of the unknown, while England teaches in an unusual way how to become an intelligence much more successful than the times.
England is returned to Whitehall and told of the emergency to meet her former sufferings companion Bough, who played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is the married man, married to the skipper of Submarines.
This capable couple went back to work, and met Ophelia Bulleter of Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, a high - ranking official believes that he could solve the problems of English computers: that wicked man Jason Volts, played by Jake Lacy
England and Bough began that rash: making themselves food suppliers, burning French food store; starting the problems when boarding the Volta class; and England brings an attack while they refuse to use the wooden Revality for the purpose of reading inside the Volta house.
Everything is done in the final sections, though interesting and interesting, rather than the television programs of children talking about all of this.
Normal objects.
As with all the other shows, Johnny English: Do I wonder if this business is big enough to make Ron Atkinson a meaningful part of his profession?
The task force denies that they make plans for British citizens to work four days but to be paid five
Jeremy Corbyn’s work force set up a four - day work schedule for five days a week but paid five days.
The report says that the team requires company executives to be paid for their earnings when companies work with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the day.
This change will allow employees to have the same pay on a three - day weekend weekend.
The sources say that this plan is ‘ well suited to the economic thinking of this group and the national reformation plan takes part of the work force.
Switching to a four - day week creates support for the Trade Union Congress as a means for employees to take part in economic changes.
The high source of Labour Party has told The Sunday Times: ‘ System monitoring is expected to be announced before the year passes.
‘ Not immediately, but the four-day work week is the ideal idea for this economic group to be alongside the employees and the business plan of the group.'
The task force was not the first to provide support for such a theory as this, and the Green Party made a four-day schedule while supporting the decision in 2017.
This program does not yet have full support at Labour Party, however.
The speaker of the Service Team said: ‘ The week of the four days of work is not a team policy and not something to watch.'
A deputy director John McDonnell used a job conference last week to explain his opinion on an economic translation that helps people.
Sir McDonnell says that he is determined to take the power of ‘ rulers who don't want to be seen' and ‘ who are profited' in big business.
The service officer's plan means that the crews of water vendors do not receive their assignment as the service government can pay ‘ payments ’ that they are not doing well.
He verified his plan to reuse employees in management positions and make a joint - owned bank with the purpose of providing 10 percent of the landless businesses to provide as much as £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI could change their thinking
A study of the FBI of accusations laid down by judge Brett Kavanough delayed his final vote by his being taken to the High Court each week, and raises the question if the results of the investigation of this center can change the negative Republicans to change their minds with the support they give.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, a reporter for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asks the busy Republicman John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI can find something that can make them close their minds.
Kennedy had no problem speaking to her friend from South Carolina.
"Yes," says Kennedy.
"I tell the judge Kavanough."
I call after this thing has been revealed, after these charges have been brought out, and I said, ‘ Have you done it?'
She was calm, confident, not afraid.
It seems, though, that Graham’s chart will not change.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanough and is forced to a heavy whip," says.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but even what I know: Brett has strongly denied these tuberries," plus Graham, talking to Chris, and Chrstine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who speaks of him can confirm these charges.
36 years
I can't see the change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done to alleviate poverty?
On this Saturday, the New York city welcomes the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a moving band for a good purpose; to end poverty.
Now the event is old, and it welcomes tens of thousands of people in Centrera; Park is not just to entertain such features as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but to inform them of the main purpose of the event in 2030 to end a severe depression.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a section in addition to the Global Poverty Project, an international agency that hopes to eliminate poverty by adding people who are responsible for fighting it.
To get a free ticket for a party (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you must perform a volunteer work like writing an e-mail, call, or any meaningful means of introducing other people to their cause for the end of poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been at the age of 12 for accomplishing its purpose?
Is it a good idea to give a person free of charge the right way to get support - people feel they are making the difference by signing online protests or putting a message in Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has reported that it has forgotten 19 million acts on its supporters, with varying objectives.
It said that these actions have helped to encourage the world’s payholders to make reports of commitments and financial policies over the $37 weeks that will take responsibility for the lives of these 2.25 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the team described 360 commitments and reports for their actions, costing $10 billion.
This group claims that their income has helped nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of these commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a cooperative institution of the U.K for the purpose of "helping children grow to this level," which promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help them achieve malnutrition in that country after they received 4.70 copies from the Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, international government and the global Citizens like you, we may be able to resolve the injustice of malnutrition," says the representative of The Power of Nutrition Ullman, informing the multitudes during a social event in London in April 2018.
The team said that after some 5,000 actions asked the U.K to improve the nutritional health of mothers and children, the government had informed the cost of handling the problem, in The Power of Nutrition, which helped mothers and children to provide food.
When they answer one of the most commonly asked questions on the Internet site "What makes you think we can solve serious poverty?"
The Global Citizen said: ‘ It's a long and difficult way - sometimes we're going to fall and lose.
But as human rights translations and the struggle for disparity in front of us, we will succeed, for we have strength when we are with others.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and others who are to entertain you at the New York annual party, will be welcomed by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
America can use water rubber to disrupt Russia’s supply of energy - energy sources
America can find protection under a navy for the purpose of preventing Russia from selling electrical energy, including in the Middle East, explaining Central American Secretary, Ryan Total, as the Washington Examiner.
She has charged Russia with being responsible for Syria - where the government’s official policy - planning system was under proposals for new electric power systems.
"I believe that their goal of being in the Middle East is to trade other countries as Europe has done in Eastern Europe, in the belly of South Europe," says.
And, according to the officers, there are ways and strength to deal with them.
"America has the power, by navy, to make sure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to prevent them, to ensure that their electricity does not go into the market," says the saying.
They have been talking to those present at an event approved by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "in the voice of electric power" in America.
He then compared America's approaches to Russia and Iran, saying they have not changed.
"The economic selection of Iran and Russia, almost as well as the raising of prices and receiving of oil," says, while calling Russia for a single-volent transistor.
The report appears after Trump’s efforts to promote the sale of water for foreign countries to Europe, the land of Russia, devoid of significant costs for Europeans.
As a result, the officers of the Trump Government, including the American President Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the work of the Nod Stream 2. According to Trump, the task has been done by the German "prison" of Russia.
Russia has also said that this Nord Stream 2 billion is about twice the current one to be 110 billion cubic miles, a good job than the economy.
Russia says that American opposition to the work has economic implications and that it is an example of poor competition.
"I believe these powers should not be a force for pressure, and the buyers must be able to select the merchants," says the Russian Energy Minister Aeksandr Novak after the meeting of American Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow on September.
America’s position in this situation is not well accepted in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
A leading department of this trade, the National Council of German Business (BDI), has requested that America move away from the EU systems of power and concordats about Germany and Russia.
"I have a big problem when the third world is disrupting our power." says Dieter Kempf, head of the German Business Center (BDI) after a meeting with German Minister Angela Merket and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren's goal will be to enter the national election in 2020, says the Massachusettste.
The Massachusetts Conservative Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday "you will consider it difficult" to enter the election of the President after the half-time election.
At the city hall at the Kingdom Hall, Warren, from Massachusetts, was convinced that he would enter the election.
"It is now the time for the stubborn people to go to Washington and repair our broken state, and that includes the presence of a person in a high office," says The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll seriously consider entering the election of the President."
Warren spoke badly about the president Donald Trump at the city hall, saying that his father "this world is in the wrong way.
"I am concerned more about what Donald Trump will do for our freedoms," he says.
Warren is known to criticize Trump and his High Court hostage Brett Kavanough.
Writing to Twitter on Friday, Warren said that "we need a FBI investigation before we are able to vote.
Nevertheless, the votes issued on Thursday show that many Warren's followers think that it was not a good idea to enter the election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the people's "thought" that the Massachusetts voters should not fit the election, according to the Suffolk Political Research Center/Boston Globe Polll.
Thirty-two gave support to this opinion.
These votes showed much support to the old retributor Deval Patrick, 38 percent supported their appointment.
Some of the names of the Democrats that were mentioned about 2020 include the sponsor of the old president Joe Biden and the Vermontian nun Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he would decide justly on January, says the Associated Press.

Track Pin, 26 years old, lives in Iraq for a year after joining the navy on September.
She was arrested and charged with domestic violence and Monday night
"What my son hears, what he hears again, I feel for other families dealing with the problems of PTSD and other injuries our soldiers have brought back." He tells those present at the dedication of Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
"Palin has been held for her son's "unanciable problem," and then said that the sotjas who faced wars "returned slowly, and returned with difficulty, asked whether they could be honored for what they had done for their country and for their military forces and for which they were going to include all the military personnel.
She was arrested on Monday at Yasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence by beating the layman and carrying the equipment, according to the chasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett.
The 18 American and D.C departments provide support in granting the new legislation to those who seek protection.
Eighteen government sections and the Columbia area provided support for the new legislation that curbs the victim of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 sectors of the government and the region have signed awards to provide support to one of the victims in need of security that enforces this law, notes NBC.
The full name of the defendants in this situation between the American Civil Liberties Union, made in August with regard to the unstated national legislation.

Imprisoned in Texas
The representatives of these federal departments give Grace support to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are the main sources of security in America, as areas that are faced with serious problems with gang members and domestic violence.
This new policy about seeking protection in America brings him up the decision of the 14th class of the refugee board, which allowed refugees from domestic violence to gain protection.
Corl Racine Regional Minister Karl Racine reported on Friday that this new legislation "responses the old rules, the state, national and international legislation"
"The National Legislatives require that all requests for shelter be considered in terms of the request, and this legislation ends," says the court's statements.
The lawyers also said that the rule to prevent refugees from entering America was harmful to the American economy, saying that they could be business and perform necessary tasks.
The General Jeff Sessions issued a law to the judges that refugees should be granted protection if they escaped domestic violence or gang violence removed in June.
"Security can be found for any who has left home because of persecution or because he is concerned about race, religion, or political opinion," said Spirits on June 11.
Security has not been made for the purpose of dealing with all the problems -- I mean the tough ones that are facing them every day throughout the world.

An American diplomat accuses China of ‘ sabotaging ’ using ‘false ads'
A week later a Chinese official published a four - page advertisement in an American newspaper dealing with the commercial interests of America and China, an American representative of China accused the country of using America’s press to spread lies.
American president Donald Trump last week told of a Chinese Daily advertisement in Desmoines Register - the best - selling newspaper of Iowa - stop to accuse China of its intention of violating the purity of November 6, which is China’s stubborn accusation.
The Trump charge that China is trying to interfere with the election is what American officials tell Reuters that a new part of the ongoing campaign for America is being subjected to oppression in China.
While it is common for governments of different countries to install commercials, China and America are currently competing with trade and increasing costs.
China adds prices at the beginning of the commercial crisis and is designed to affect foreign export merchants on government projects such as the Iowa who support the Rupmp of the Republican, says experts in China and America.
Terry Branstad, the American representative in China and the old governor of Iowa, selling to China a large portion of the food crops, said that China has damaged American employees, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes his opinion on the Des Moines Register, "she is determined to exploit it by putting false ads in our remote newspapers."
"When spreading false news, the Chinese government puts himself at risk of hearing America using its usual custom of free speech and free publicity and advertising facilities in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brandon.
"In contrast, in the news section here at Beijing when you go down the street, you will find little different opinions and will never see how the Chinese really think of China's economic development, we think the newsmen are under China's Communist party, writing.
He added that "one of the most common newspapers refused his request to publish this article" even if he didn't say where the newspaper was.
The Republicans chased rounds before the election of the satellite against Kavanough’s problem, warning critics
Like the high - ranking Republicans standing next to the High Court’s kidnapman Brett Kavanough and protecting him from his charges of sexual abuse, the investigators say they will see the bad luck, especially for the people in the rounds, at this future election of the first half.
Feelings about this situation have been overwhelming, and the Republicans have also said that they want to continue the election.
You can't go back," says Grant Reeher, a university professor of plastic studies at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, telling The Hill when an article was published on Saturday.
Reeher points out that the final attempt to replace Jeff Flake (R-Arina) by beginning the FBI research would change the opinion of angry voters.
"People all around will not quickly forget what happened tomorrow - will not be tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and public speaker of the advancing Moveon group on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters were again saying, "Come on November!" walking on the concrete corridor as the Republics controlled the Justice Committee and decided to continue the kidnapping of Kavanough despite the doctor's testimony of physician Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
‘ He's interested in freedom and the prosthesis of art," says Stu Rothenberg, an neutral critic, informing this news agency.
"People have begun to say that you are up right now, and this is true.
But there may be more than this, especially for people who have not yet decided who will vote with the young votes, who are 18-2 years old, who, although not interested in the President but not normally vote."
Even before Ford’s public evidence of the accusations against the High Court for sexual abuse, analysts say that there can be negative results when the Republicans are in need of confirmation.
"This has turned into a problem with the GOP," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republic National Committee last week at its beginning, according to the NBC News.
‘ It doesn't matter whether the last committee's vote or whether Kavanough enters the cabinet, as well as the way the Republics are dealt with the situation, and how they are treated," states Guy Cecil in this news agency, the administrator of the Priorities USA, a team that assists the Democrats to select the Democrats.
Even so, the churches seem unable to understand who they are between the evidences of Ford and Kavanough, although there are few others who take sides in the latter.
Forty percent of those taking part in one survey showed that they probably believe or fully believe the evidence of Ford, while 35 percent indicated that they may believe it either fully or fully believe the attitude of Kavanough.
In addition, 38 percent who thought that Kavanough is likely or are convinced that he was lying when he gave a witness are, at the same time, only 30 percent say the same about Ford.
After Flake’s interest, the FBI investigates the charges brought against Ford and another slanderer, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
Ford reported on before the court of justice the previous week that Kavanough abused him sexually with 18 sexual abuse when he was drunk by Kavanuagh.
Ramirez accuses that the High Court’s captive revealed her private parts to him when they came to the scene while they were studying in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
Internet developer has developed a plan to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, an Internet producer, is embarking on a new business intended to compete with Facebook, the Amazon and Google.
This technological device has a new Inrupt system, a business that produces Solid a system available to everyone.
The Solid allows its users to choose their details from the location and who are permitted to see the details.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Bernards-Lee has discussed for the purpose of Inrupt as "control of the World."
"We must do it now," he speaks of this business.
"minutive minute"
This system incoming technology allows people to create a "recognition site" or PED.
It can include a list of telephone numbers, a list of things to do, a calendar, your music, and other personal and work activities.
It is like that Google Dry, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify are in the same place at the same time.
Different from this storage area is the choice of a user to determine what one can see.
This company calls you "a personal institution of knowledge."
Inrupt, according to chief business manager John Bruce, to bring up the weapons, systems and abilities that correspond to make the Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a system purchased by IBM, personnel promoting the process and the society of volunteer manufacturers.
Since this week, the world's technology producers can produce a single program that they have developed by using the Internet Web site.
Berners- Lee said he and his team speakers "Facebbook and Goode have made some major changes that would cause their business to disappear overnight.
‘ We will not ask their permission. ’
"Berers-Lee said when writing to Media on Saturday that the purpose of Inrupt was that "to provide an interest in businesses and areas which would help to protect the integrity and standard of the new Internet created by the Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet while creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the Internet's anti-netive conversation.
When officially opened Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the creator and administrator of the World Wide Web Conscortium, the Internet Center and Open Data Center.
"I was happy to pass this new section of Internet," adding Bernards-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoriaros pastor at WW1
The first and last week to find Victoria Cross during the World War I.
Lt. Col. Cardinal Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918, while the attack at Ballengise and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, he was killed by a long - range cat strikeer who died without knowing that in four days he would receive the highest prize in Britain.
A monument was opened to his two grandsons in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, pointed out that the stone’s removal is not easily forgotten because it was revealed 100 years after his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vann paid his subordinates to pass through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in severe fog and with heavy guns and machine guns."
Later he fled to those shootings and bravely took those big guns and machine guns alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German who carried a long-distinted cat-fiction on October 4 1918 - more than a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says that his grandfather's actions are "a thing he knows he can't do but said it's humble."
He and his brother Dr James Vann recorded a history made into a circle after he was in the Brentopian Imperial Youth Bank.
Michael Vann says he feels "responsible as he has played a part in the march" and added that "the courage of the true hero will be displayed by many people who give support."
IMMA supporters did not sleep to see Bellator 206, but only Peppa Pig
Think about this, and stay awake because you want to see Bellator 206 just to meet and that he will not play it.
San Jose’s program has already had 13 wars, including six distributed around midnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
On 6 o'clock in the morning, at a time when George Mousasi and Rory MacDonald, observers at the UK were surprised to see the changes taking place in Peppa Pig.

Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley feels ‘ little because of his sex.
The salter Tom Daley says that he has grown smaller because of his sexual appearance - but has given him the incentive to succeed.
This 24-year-old man says I have seen when I go to second school that I am "not like other people."
Commenting on the first practice of Desert Island Discs conducted by Lauren Laverne in Radio 4, he says that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give them "hope."
He said that being a parent would lead him to stop being concerned about winning the Olympics.
The most common program manager, Kirsten Young, has seen months of illness.
To appear as a person cast off in the first Laverne conference, Dley says he felt inferior when he grew up because it was "unauthorized to love girls."
He said: ‘ Until this day, feelings of narrowness and dissimilarity are the things that have made me the interest and strength to succeed. ’
He wanted to prove himself "it is something," he said, so that he would not be ashamed of everyone if they found out about his or her sexlike condition.
This winner who won the two Olympic championships has publicly declared the LGBT and has used his fame this year for the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries for justice.
She said that she felt good for being able to live free from problems and want to give others "hope."
The Third World Conqueror had fallen in love with another man - an American producer of shows in 2013 - 'it was not expected."
Dale has married the Oscar Conqueror, who is 20 years older than he was last year but who says that the gap was not a problem.
"When dealing with such things as the youth" - to his first Olympics at 14 years of age and his father died from cancer three years later - he says it was difficult to find a person of the same age who faces the same life problems.
The couple were parents in June, they found a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and they said that "all his opinions have changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to ‘ get a gold ring, ’ he said.
"You know, there are great things to finish the Golden Compass.
My Golden club Robbie.
Her son has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after doctors first diagnosed brain cancer.
“ My dear dad never gave in to the loss, ” recalls Dale, “and he asked whether we were together in the real - life ticket in London.
"I couldn't say ‘ you' won't be in the front seat, I'll say.
"I would hold her in her hand when she had finished breathing, and I saw after she had no breath that she could stay forever," he said.
The following year Stanley competed in the 2012 Olympics and found a copper medal.
‘ I could see that this was what I had always dreamed of — splashing in the water before the multitudes in the Olympic sport, I could not feel better, ’ says.
He was also interested in saying his first proud, a soft - tonguedud that seemed to attract the attention of the performer and made him nervous.
The Desert Island Discs is located at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Aggregate Mickelson is put in a battery on the Ryder Cup game that Saturday.
Mel Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th version of the Ryder Cup but has to change his performance so as not to make this unpleasant record.
Mickelson, who plays the event twice a year for the 12th year, is inserted into the guitar by Captain Jim Fulyk in a four - game game game with four players.
Instead of being watched by the crowds, as is the custom in playing the American game, this winner, who won five times won, spent half of his day in silence and again trained to correct the problem.
Although he is still a high - level player, this 48 - year - old player is not well qualified to play in the Le Golf National, where grass is available and makes it difficult for players to hit the ball badly.
If the playing field itself is frightening, Mickelson, at the ninth Sunday game, is facing Francesco Molinari, who is the best ball for the British Open, who has collaborated with school - age Tommy Fleetwood to win all their games in the park.
If the Americans, less than 4 points, can properly start 12 games on their own, Mickelson's game will become more important than anything else.
Fulyk expressed confidence in her husband as expected.
"She fully understood her role today, hit me in the back with her arm and said she would be ready tomorrow,"
"You have real confidence in yourself.
You have found the site of a famous hall and have added much to these groups in the past time, and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought he would play more games than he did, but it didn’t go the way we expected.
He wants people to know him, like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo’s record of many games in the Ryder Cup in the Church game.
It can make a decision for his play on the Ryder Cup that does not differ from his personal record.
Mickelson has won 18 times, it has been divided 20 times, and has had some number of zeros, and too, when Fulyk said that his presence brought an invisible element to this class.
"You are funny, humory, quick respond, good humor and good sense in the gang room" to explain.
"I was amazed to see young players laughing about him this week."
It offers much more than happiness.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that speed may be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European president, knows that we can easily lose the rank of ahead of the Ryder Cup but can change at any time.
The sport started playing in Valderma in 1997, where the role paid by the Seva Ballestros was five points ahead of America but then buried in the back, winning on 1411⁄2-1311⁄21⁄2.
"You will tell yourself that you have many articles in Valderra; you have several articles in Brookline, where it is carried along with Valderma, where we won, hard," to "Bjorn, pictured, after viewing the 2015 school victory on 5-3 Fridays, 10-6 articles on Le Golf National.
History will therefore teach me and everyone in the group if this is not yet done.
We will spend everything we have tomorrow
We will do all that is necessary to do.
This is not yet complete until the points on the board are reached.
It’s a goal, and it’s an attempt to win the battle when it’s aimed at us.
I've said, I’m going to the 12 players on my side, but we know that we’re going to face anything in the same case as the rest of the world's participants.'
Excited by the way his players played in this difficult game, Bjor added: "I never really thought about this.
The next day we will speak about the same thing.
The next day a personal play ability is checked, and that is different.
It is not unusual to have a mate where things are going well, but when you are alone, you are first tested as to your strength.
That is a message that must be found by all players, who must demonstrate their identity tomorrow.
Now, you don't come with your partner also have to prove yourself."
Unlike Bjorn, man Jim Furyk has been looking for his players to play well alone and not as a team, except Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who receive three to four notes.
Fulyk was once the two sides of the last day's revolutions, she was alongside Brookline when she was defeated as Europe did the "miracle at Medinah."
"I remember everything he says," in reply, Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, how did he add interest to them when they came to the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but we don't have to remember that as you saw it in Brookline and Medinah.
Every time you start winning, it puts stress on the balance.
We organize our players in order and put them in a way that will have a good effect, you know, we want to do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to pay military resuscipation and to meet Rory McIlroy in the upper sport, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulterhu Yurpohu in the upper distance.
"I go with this group of men with this schedule because I think they are going to be over everything," says Brjyn in this selection of individuals.
The German warship has been launched again.
A new German ship must be released in 2014 to enter the position of warships known as the Corn War, but the following year it will not be freed because of the difficulties of the ship and the cost, says the news reporters.
The release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a freighter produced by Baden-Wuttermberg-class frigates, was postponed by the first half of 1920, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, says the military spokesman.
The ship should not have joined the navy by 104, but the arrival of the cargo has done that.
The four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg in 2007 will also be replaced by Bremen ships.
It was known that there would be a powerful weapon, as well as weapons and aircraft and other technology that made it invisible to Radar, infrared and autics.
Also important if it takes a long time before it needs correction can go on for two years without home.
However, further disturbances make these new ships - which are said to give German power overseas and become obsolete when launched.
This naval vessel was brought out of the news last year, while the German navy officially opposed throwing the ship back to Bom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was for the first time the navy returned the ship to the shipyard after being launched.
Little is known about the reasons for returning the ship, but German sources say that there have been "inflammatory" problems and goods, which have made the ship useless in war.
The machinery is more efficient as the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships are used by about 120 people - half of the people who are forced to use the old Bremen.
Also, it seems that the ship is too heavy to reduce her ability and that the navy will not be able to improve it in the future.
This 7,000-ton ship, "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to survive two times more than such ships were used by the Germans in the second world war.
Despite goods that do not work, the cost of all this work - plus the educational costs of employees to use it is now beginning to become a problem.
It is said to be estimated to have reached about 1.83.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from %.22 billion.2 billion
The problems of new ships are important when it is pointed out that the strength of the German Navy is dwindling
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the officer of the German Security Committee, admitted that the navy is ‘ losing warships.'
The officer says that the problem has grown old as the years have continued, since older ships were discharged from the navy but no new ones were launched.
Then he said that no other ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg was able to join the navy.
The New Trust broadcast reports about gull - like animals
A new excavations in the Scottish Highlands need to explain how the animals use their environment to obtain food.
It is hoped that the results will enlighten us about the behavior of these animals and how they can be protected.
This is a series made by scientists from Scotland’s National Trust to follow these familiar animals, which make a noise like soprano, with long ears and Daubentons at the Invewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording machines will be placed in important positions in this area to indicate what they are doing during the year.
NHS staff and volunteer workers will make a tour of the participants with handheld machines.
Sound experts will check the records to show their calls and what this type of behavior does.
The maps of the nests and reports will be produced indicating the behavior of the animals.
Rob Dewar, an environmental consultant for the NTS Defense, hopes that the results will be that seeing these animals come in whatever place they like and whatever places are used.
These details will help you to know what benefits are available to protect wildlife habitats and how to conserve wildlife habitats.
The presence of animals in Scotland and the UK has declined a hundred years ago.
They are at risk because of the construction and development of habitats.
The air and light can endanger these animals and flying journals and chemicals from buildings, as well as the attacks of cats.
These creatures are not blind.
Even so, the main demand for daily food is greater for the hearing than for their eyes when it comes to catching food.
They receive their food by means of an emotional outburst when they return to their ears to see what kind of food they are exposed to as they fly.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 old areas, 38 important gardens, and 66,000 acres [6,000 ha] of land, assume that these animals are important.
It consists of ten trained professionals, repopulating themselves, surveying their living quarters and sometimes rescues.
The center has created an exhibit in Scotland in Threave on Dumfries and Galloway, with eight species of animals
The head of the area, David Thompson, says that this is a suitable place for them
"Here in Threave we have a good place for these animals," says.
"We have old places, old trees and beautiful living quarters.
There is so much that you can know about animals that no one knows, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us explain what they need to live.
He says that the value of testing these animals before you take care of them is important, since an accident in a child’s habitat can cause 400 children to die out, which can cover all of that.
These animals are safe and illegal in suicides, which they also abuse with their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland's Bat Conservation Trust officer, encouraged the public to help.
He said: ‘ There is still much to know about these animals and how many species we don't know.'
Ronalo has answered accusations of fraud and has sent his lawyers to destroy a German magazine
Cristiano Rolando has called the rape charges false, claiming that people want to make a name for themselves.
His lawyers will launch the German news agency Der Spiegel, which is responsible for the charges.
Portugal and Juventures allegedly raped an American madman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in 2009
He is said to have ordered $37,000 to say nothing about the event, claims Der Spiegel on Friday.
Regarding the Instalgram which spread to his 142 million followers after just a few hours of these charges were made, Ronaldo, 33 years old, dismissed himself as "false."
"No, not, but, only, not, etc.
What they have said today, a lie at all, the Balon d'Or'D five times saying to the camera.
"They want to make themselves known to men in my name.
It’s normal.
They want to be identified by my name, but it is now more common.
I’m happy and ready,' addition to the player, he laughs.
The attorneys of Ronalo are willing to lay down the Der Spiegel on these charges which, according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schertz says that the player needs to let go of "spiritual injury with the abuse of personal rights in the past years."
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a hotel called Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a drinking club, Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have taken to the theater, where they rape him back, according to paper posted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, she fell on her knees after the incident of which she was accused of being "a good person" "99 percent" is a problem by the percentage of one.
They say that Ronaldo made sure that the couple stayed together, but they agreed.
Myorga said that she went to the police station and took pictures of their injuries in the hospital, but later they agreed to talk to each other out of court because she felt she was afraid of returning and worried of being humiliated.
The 34 - year - old says that he now wants them to go back to their home because what Ronalddo said still hurts.
Ronaldo was about to enter the Real Madrid from Manchester United when the charge took place, and this summer he went to the great Italian group Juventus for a sale of  experiences of about  experiences of about 1.8 million million dollars.
Brexit: UK will ‘ regret it forever ’ for losing car manufacturers.
The UK "will regret it forever" when it loses its leading position in producing motors after Breg Clark, says electronic secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was of concern that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that Britain could travel through the EU after a discussion will stop briefly to produce their firm in Burkinaston, near Derby.
"We need a combination," says Mr. Clark.
This car producer from Japan has suggested the possibility of slowing the flow of goods off the border if no connections in Brexit will be completed.
The Buurnaston product - producing Toyota Auris and the Avensis — produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90 percent of the spectacle is exported to the European Union.
"My reason is that if Britain travels on the EU when the Mash is finished we will see the wake stop at our birth," says Marvin Cooke, the administrator of Toyota in Burkiston.
Some UK manufacturers have expressed their fear of running the EU without a combination of trade, including Honda, BMW and the Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Onday product in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Serious anxiety about this can pose a risk to trade when there is no connection in Brexit.
The Toyota surveillance list is conducted by the "time" system, with motor goods coming every 37 minutes from merchants from the UK and EU for the purpose of producing cars as soon as possible.
And while the UK travels in the EU without any combination on 29 March, it may be disturbing to the extent that the business may be delayed and insufficient clothing.
In fact, Toyota would never have enough clothes to meet the real day in the Derbyshire project, and the production would stop.
Sir Clark said that the Theresa May plan with the EU's association was "for the purpose of not encountering this risk of a check on the border."
"We need a combination. We need a very good combination that will allow us to take this step," telling radio 4 of BBC on the system called Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers explains that we need to continue where we have been through the most effective development."
Toyota did not appear for how long the diagnosis will last, and has been warned that the rising costs will reduce the effectiveness of competition as time passes.
Peter Tsoullabaris, who has worked for the Businesston for 24 years and is attending Unit in this project, says that they are about to be worried again. "The time I've worked, I know I'll never return"
The government spokesman is: ‘ bring us a reliable plan about future cooperation with the EU.
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed, says the American president’s office
The important Dalld Trump conference and the general attorney Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week as the choice of the higher court of Brett Kavanough continues, says the president.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who conducted a Russian election - based investigation, as well as a convention between the Trumps and Russia and disrupting the arm of the law by the president
The fact that Trump does not expel the general attorney, putting Mueller’s independence at risk, has been the cause of many Washington gossipings these past months
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein said he would wear a viewpoint that would lead to a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by means of a change
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But on the last day he went to the White House House, among the reports he was going to cancel.
Instead, meetings with them
Trump said he would not ‘ choose ’ to drive Royentein but the conference delayed to avoid a confrontation in the Committee of the Committee hearing where Kavanough and one of the sexually charged girls, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of them have witnessed.
On Friday, Tump has authorized one week's investigation of the FBI with a case against Kavanough, which has further called for the complete Canate's vote.
Trump news secretary, Nsz Sarah Sanders, appeared in the Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein conference, he said: "On the day when it was not used, otherwise this week, I saw that the rest of the week was assigned to all other things going on in the high court.
But we will see and always want to keep thepress updated.
Other researchers disagree with this: The Sanders did not drive the White House line since 10 September.
Commander Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of arguments was not due to the interruption of the "big" TV vendors, although he said: "I would not agree to look."
She recommended direct contact between Trump and the raisepress.
"The president makes Q&A sessions and sessions rather than any president before," he added without reading the evidence: "Those values are not usable.
Reports are going to take place, Sanders said, but if the printer has the opportunity to ask the president of America directly questions, it is better to talk to me.
We try to do so and have seen him do a lot of things in the last few weeks and it will take place instead of the printing comments when you speak with the U.S. president.
Trump will always ask questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or connecting conferences with talks.
Solo news conferences are a disaster.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, he made a freeheeling and other invisible periods before meeting the news.
The Health secretary writes to the EU staff in NHS Scotland about Brexit
The Health Secretary wrote the Scottish personnel in NHS to express their national thanks and wish to stay in Post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP has sent a letter less than six months away from the UK and removed it from the EU.
The Scottish government has dedicated itself to meeting the cost of the EU environment applications for public services.
In his letter, Mrsz Freeman wrote: ‘ During this type of time, the conversations between the UK and the EU on the expulsion have continued, leading to the expected decisions in the fall.
But the UK Government has compiled its plans about an unlikely situation.
I know this should be very disturbing to all.
That is why I want to regain my appreciation for the contribution made to the whole crew, regardless of the country.
Brothers from all over the EU, and above, bring out the important experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service, and benefit the patients and the people we are using.
The Skotland is your living place and we would like you to stay here.
Abercrombie Chris Ingos Surgery Emergency After Following direct Shepherd Head Head Injury
The Tennessee State Thebackback Chrisy Abercrombie was elected immediately after a rape of the head on Saturday 3127 in Vanderbilt Commores, reports by Mike Organ.
The director general of the state of Tennessee Rist Reed has told the press that shortly before a short time, injuries can occur.
"He reached the line of the side and fell down," says Reed.
The trainers and medical staff offer Abercrombie on the switch on course before putting him on board and returning him for testing.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was not opened to the Vanderbil Medical Centre.
Harris added that there is no "verification of the type/ size of the damage at present" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happens.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore (Nunior at the University, but only in their 2nd year of playing college), the first break with Tennessee State after transfer to Illinois.
She had five troops on Saturday before she finished the game, bringing her full time to 18 pounds.
Other receivables will be paid for the UK property
The foreign buyers will be paid for buying the UK property and additional funds used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
The rise will reduce the Corbyn success of driving to attract lower votes.
The increase in the activity of the station will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Fund is expected to rise to £20 million a year to help the homeless.
The buyers of other markets are used to pay to the highest quality of the familitation work in the UK - as well as the extra money used to help the homeless, Theresa May will bring them today.
The rise will seem to be an attempt to reduce the performance of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young votes by vows to provide purchased houses and aim for the higher.
The increasing number of pumping operations will be paid by individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, as well as additional funds to improve Russia's ability to carry out the battle against sleeping.
The extra fee for the current stamp work, including the high levels installed two years ago in two homes and the purchase of employment, may be about 30 percent.
The Fund is expected to raise to £20 million annually.
An estimated 13 percent of the new facilities built in London are purchased by the UK inhabitants, to conduct costs and make it difficult for the early buyers to get a foot at the level of the house.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly capital - have become the "home" because of the high foreign consumers who spend their time in this country.
A new policy comes after weeks after Boris Johnson asked that the stamp be cut off for the benefit of new homeowners.
He persecutes large firms in the building to maintain high property costs by exporting land but not using it, and urged Mrsz Mei to stop platforms in shopping homes to repair the British "house scandal."
Sir Corbyn has brought in a list of proposed house - repair operations, including rent management and deduction.
He also wants to give many huge councils to build new homes.
Msz May said: "Last year I said I was going to give your premediarship back to Britain’s dream - that life would be better for each new generation.
And that means repairing our real - estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to stay, work, and build life here.
Even so, it would not be good for the UK blind people, with outside companies, to buy homes as hard-working British citizens.
For most people the dream of a homeowner has been a long way off, and the destruction of a painful sleep remains a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My top chest is controlling Scotland'
Sunderland Chief Jack Ross says that his "high ambition" is the Scottish Captain at a certain stage.
Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of rebuilding the Northern-East sub-Common, currently occupying the third position in the League One, three stand up.
She moved to the Stadium of Light in this short period after leading St Mirren to the Premiership of the Scottish Season.
I want to make my country like a toy.
I have B bulls and if, "Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports.
‘ But I grew up looking at Scotland in Henden more and more as a child, and it remains my protection.
That opportunity will come, however, if I succeed in mastering the club."
Ross chiefs as administration of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio
The former general of Allo-Athletic says that he did not have the courage to follow the technical terms in a large club, which has already discarded parts from Barnsley and Ipswich City.
"How successful for me during this time will be followed 'Should I restore this module to the Prince of the League?'
Because of the construction and facilities in this game, no doubt in a Premier League, "he said so.
'It' isn't easy to find there, but probably I'll just see if I succeed here to return to the group.'
Ross for only three years in his charge area, after a time as an assistant to Dumbarton and 15 days in Coachingstaff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the third entry, and changed St Mirren from the level of support at the Championship level in the next phase.
And Ross says that he feels more comfortable than he did during his play in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, Hamilton Academy.
"It was possible to be real," remembering, by taking Alloa.
"I really believe that the rule is good for me, more than to play.
It sounds wonderful because I have done well, have made life in it better, and have enjoyed it on a high level.
But playing can be challenging.
There are many things that you have to do each week.
I am still doing so in accordance with the stresses and pressures of the work, but the control feels correct.
I always wanted to control myself, and now I do that, feeling that I am free to be in my bag for the rest of my life of the elders.

The full time for the pin is 5.30pm on Saturday, the investigation sees
The summer type of heatwave has encouraged the removal of the heavy British bridges, but they are particularly concentrated in the restaurants.
Pub and bar groups saw the sale of 2.7 percent on July - but the taking of meals was down to 4.8 percent, displayed by the number.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy journalism CGA, which included these figures, said: "The long continuance of the sun with England rather than expected to take part in the World Crucial Clai followed the same example last year of June, when the pubs rise by 2.8 percent, unless the restaurants have been hard.
The dropping of 1.8 percent in a trading store in June increased dramatically in July.
Drinking valves and bars are more likely to be more than a taste for more than a low - table restaurant.
Food- headed pubs were also destroyed by the sun, although they are not as much as diners.
It seems that people want to get out of alcohol.
In all the quabs carried and drinking bars were more than 6.6 percent of the month, with a 3- percent diet.
Paul Newman, social analysts and guests, RSM says: "These effects continue with the atmosphere we have seen since April.
The weather and the effects of major social or sports matters are always the most important when it comes to export.
It is no wonder that shopping groups continue to fight, although a decrease of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly painful at the cost of increasing costs.
The long-burning summer will not come at a very critical time for the drivers leading to food and when it will mean that the temperature taken by August will give more breathing.
The general increase in sales in pubs and stores, including new receptions, was 2.7 percent July, indicating the improvement of black outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker of the UK Pub, bur and the food department's menu collects and logistic data from 47 working groups, and combined prices over £ungu-9 million, and a set medical model.
One of five students with confidential radio accounts hiding from their parents
One of five children - others, such as the three children - with public security accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, demonstrates that
The research of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the growth of the "Insta" false pages.
News has raised the claim that sex is promoted in these channels.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "chief" account to show their parents
One of five children - others like 11 children - create social accounts with adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid growth in the "Instake Insta" account, which refers to the Instaggram housing site.
News reports have raised fears that sex themes are sent.
Twenty percent of the students said that they are running a "necessary" account to show their parents, when alone.
One mother who was upset at her 13-year-old daughter found a girl who touched others to "take me out."
Research, with the Digital Awareness UK and the Head of the independent Head (HMC) schools, found 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 years of age, with two reports, and half of those who agreed to keep their accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: ‘ It disturbs many new people who are tempted to create Web sites where parents and teachers cannot find them.'
Elidh Doyle will be "the voice of the players" board of the Scottish Atletics
Elidh Doyle has been selected on the Scottish Atletic board as the non-commander at the regular annual convention.
Doyle, Scottish driver and Scottish assistant and Internet chairman Ian Beattie described travel as a good opportunity for those who take the lead in the games to benefit from his high international experience in the past ten years.
"Elidh has great respect throughout Scotland, the UK and the world’s sports community and we are sure that Scottish athlets will benefit by taking her out of the board," says Bettie.
Doyle said: "I like to act like the voice of a performer and I hope to help and guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has won 200 metres and 400 metres in the Atlanta games between the Olympic gold gold and now the BBC regularly, has been left unable to move after the use of ischemic attacks.
He wrote in Twitter: "Last month I have been affected today.
I didn’t go.
The doctors said that it would be time to tell me who I was and what I was going to be.
It was a tiring task but returned, learned again how to walk and today make a gastills!
Thank you for encouraging messages!
An apiary by comparing mothers with cows to an online opinion.
The post-pop company has classified the opinion of the Internet commercials and the advertising of young mothers to cows held.
To emphasize the development of so-called "first brokebulk pump," Elvie's company has released the theme of the sic-in-cheek inspired video display to show the new freedom pump gives mothers to advertise.
The four mothers have a dance on the bar filled with fresh cows on the same tracks that include sounds like: "Yes, I don't understand them, but you don't see tail" and "If you didn't realize these things, they're not.
The chorus continues: "Pamp it out, pump it out, feed it, pump it, pump it, pump it, and put my girls in it."
Even so, an advertisement, printed on a file film, has caused much controversy over the Internet.
With the opinion of 77,000 and hundreds of states, the video has received a mixed answer from viewers, many say it means "discrimination" in the milk industry.
"A suitable solution is used by the cattle to announce this product.
As with us they have to become pregnant and have to give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are introduced to them before the days of delivery, "printing one.
Elvie's chest gun closely fits in the storage vessel (Elvie / mother).
Another said: ‘ It’s a clear concern for mother and child.
But why not use this to print apupupu to mothers who will keep their children?
Another person added: "Uncovered in sales."
Some defend the declaration, one woman admitted that she had found a "clean" song.
‘ I think this is a public opinion.
I shall be alone if I fill them.
It made me feel like a bull.
The advertising really hurts a little, but I took it for myself.
This is a brain product, "one wrote.
Another said: "This is a beautiful advertisement directed to mothers who handle them (usually at their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘ cattle.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the milk industry. "
At the end of the video, a group of participants indicated that everyone was playing with the distress pumps.
The theme of the campaign is based on the idea that many prominent women have been inclined to feel like cattle.
Elvie Pmp, therefore completely silent, neither the wire nor the moths and it interacts firmly within the wrapb, giving women freedom to walk, hold their children, and go out.
Ana Bararin, an ECD counterpart to Mother, said: "Elvie's steam is such a vacancy product which was appropriate for the development of the liver and the touch.
By showing the similarities between women and milk cows we wanted to put breast beats and all the physical difficulties, when it shows how fun and what looks like a senseless freedom will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has made it a target.
During the Mondon week, the mother of two children appeared in the desktopcathalk of Freda Jawowski while using this product.
Many should be busy in the Tete Texas Border Camp
The number of adopted children who have moved abroad, although the moon's frequency remains constant, thanks to the section that the heavy control and control systems of the Trump system make it difficult to establish children and support.
Traditionally, many activists have become foreign, and have threatened their survival of the country by further calling a child.
The risk increased by June, when government authorities announced that the supporters and other older members of their homes should wear fingerprints, and if the ceremony is to be shared with the authorities.
Last week, the Mateu Albence, the supreme executive and the Revenue Development of the Overdation and Transfers, testified before the Conference that the Minister has supported the majority of the applicants who applied for the support of non-constitution children.
The Ministry later made sure that 70 percent of the arrests had no record of crime.
"About 80 per cent of the people who support or support family members are not illegal in the country, and a large fhank is for these foreigners who are in conflict with the law.
So we continue to pursue such people, says Mr. Albence.
In order to make rapid progress to the children, officers are promising new laws that will require that others appear in court within a month, not long after 60 days, are the earliest restrictions, regarding the housing personnel.
Many will appear on the telephone conference, rather than take a seat, to defend their legal position on the move.
Those considered unworthy of freedom will soon be removed.
After a long stay in a cell, children may say that they can become anxious or depressed, which may eventually lead to or even disappear, according to social workers and reports that have been published in the months to come.
Supporters say that this concern has been raised in a large centre such as Tornillo, where the child's severe symptoms may be forced, because of its size.
They added that taking the children to a tent town without providing enough time to prepare themselves physically or to say that friends could pick up much of the damage they suffered.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish that it is rapidly dependent
In view of the United Nations Assembly, Minister Walid al-Mualem also invited the Syrians's refugees to come home, although the war was now the eighth year.
Moulem, also serving as prime minister, says that the outside forces of the Syrian world are illegally, under the sense of fighting violence, and "it will be properly taken."
"They have to throw out quickly and without order," said the Church.
The Moualem emphasized that "a war of event is raging" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died in 2011, and millions more were displaced from their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until we complete the whole part of Syria.
The United States has 2,000 military forces in Syria, generally training and counseling the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-assad.
France has over 1,000 wars in a war - torn country
In a matter of refugees, the Moulem said that these restrictions were good for her to return, and he said that "some Western countries" because of spreading the irrational fear that the refugees stay far away.
‘ We have called the international sectors and public organisations for this payment, ’ he said.
‘ They kept clear what should be people's concern.'
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no restructuring in Syria until there is a political concordat between the Assad and opposition to the end of war.
UN links say that a newly signed agreement between Russia and Turkey is established at the level of the tampon of the Idlib headquarters has given opportunity to further political claims.
The Russian talk in Turkey launched a fierce attack on the Russian health - conscious population of Russia, where three million people live.
The Moualem but emphasized that the treaty "has been in place for a long time" and expressed the hope that the military party will direct the missions to the conflicts, including the All-Qaeda-related Nusra Front, "to be destroyed."
UN delegate Staffan de Misura hopes that he will soon join the first conferences of a new committee organized by government members and opposition to form a Syrian military constitution and to provide a choice course.
The Moualem set up conditions for the Syrian State's contribution to the committee, saying that the functions of the plenary must be prevented from "recognition of the articles of the current constitution," and warned against disturbance.
Why will Trump succeed in the second quarter
In that sense, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 option unless, most liberal observers are probably optimistic, erring and abusive enough to eliminate their president in advance.

A region that had just been destroyed in the town of Pittsburgh, which recently reached the Democratic Rep.
The Lamb works against another authorized person, the Republic Keith Rothfus, currently representing the Pennsylvania district of 12, which is largely carrying 17th.
Maps were raised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had judged in January if the old provinces were not in the constitution as pleased by the Republic.
The new competition in 17 has prevented the financial slugfest in the main unit fund, the Democratic Committee of the Community Committee (DCCC) and the National Council of the Republic of Cultural Affairs (NRC).

U.S. Scaled Penaling El Salvador With Chinese Support, after which it was supported
Diplomats say that the Romican Republic and Panama have chosen Beijing, leaving Washington.
Mr Trump had a delightful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the companion released the Trump Organization.
The Government Department has decided to return the American guests of El Salvador, the Romican Republic, and the Panama about "the decisions that have been 'even recently destroyed to be able to see Taiwan," says Heather Nauert, who speaks for the Department, at the statement of the month.
But the sentences were considered only for El Salvador, which earned $140 million of American AIDS in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Predatory penalties, which include the establishment of financial support and defuncts aimed at, would be sad in the North American country with a lack of high jobs and rates of murder.
As the medieval meetings progressed, North America and North America's officials have postponed a high assembly aimed at security and economic development following the same conference last year that was considered to be a major step in preventing migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid- September, the senior authorities explained that they wanted the conference to continue, completely eliminating any consideration of El Salvador's judgments.

Reading history
The next point to drop can be Robert Mueller’s special counsel in defense of righteousness, where there is much evidence in public information.
Mr Mueller is said to have answered his investigation and that Mr. Trump is linked with Russia in its attack of our election.
If Congriss will change his hands, Mr. Trump will find himself in the weight of the body, as he is ready to go back to the vote, perhaps finally becoming a judge of his peers.
This is a lot, and I do not like to show that Sir Trump is inevitable or unconventional in Europe.

Ranggers'Graham Dorrans with the hope in front of Ripid Vienna
The Rangers Force Rud Vienna on the fourth day, knowing that the victory of the Austrians, after following the Spanish in opposition to the Villarreal at the start of the month, will put them in the right place to fit the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the first time until the 2nd drawing with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers could use that effect as a great performance.
"It was a good article for us because Villarreal is the right thing," says this 31-year-old child.

Public prosecutors need a rare CHIC death sentence
New York prosecutors sought a death sentence on St. Saipov, a defendant in New York City for a courageous attack that killed eight persons with a strange punishment that had not been carried out during police crime since 1953.

"He asked me if I held it secretly and kept it secret as he asked.

Perhaps he didn't, but it was the worst type of body I had seen.
Continuing to protect the Supreme Court President, who is accused of sexual immorality by three women, the president explained that Democratic are used for their judgments.

" NSZ Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the quotation.
Even so, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrsz Maurice twice.
After recognizing his gaffe, the Plasco-Flaxman was dismissed by Nsz Mauritius, their emerging nany, who was an American, had done a worse job and rather than expect a Filipino, according to the New York Post.

"I want to show it, look, you don't do such things," he told the mail on Friday, adding "I know I'm against."
The couple accused them of being racially prejudiced, saying that it was reasonable to leave the work of Maurice, fearing that they could trust him after being upset.
"My wife has sent her that which she doesn't like to say."
He is not a nation.
We are not racial people, "Man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you put your children in the hands of someone who had made a quick, although it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come."
To liken the suit to "robing," Plasco said his wife was just two months old if she had a child and "might."
"Are you going to follow such a man?
That is not the best thing to do, "The bank of interest is added.
Although the case is still in progress, a human court has been quick to look at a couple quoted from the world’s media, highlighting their conduct and views.
The publishers in Paddington were afraid that students did not agree with the talker, a new publication showing
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, said: ‘ It is difficult to put on the shoes of the person who reads it for the first time before it is printed.
I am amazed now that we know about great success in Paddington. "
He said that his father, who served as BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's manual on a small Bible, would be a rare man about his banned work, adding that the book was a pleasant one 60 years after his death last year.
In Paddington, which describes "the most important member in the family," added his father naturally trusted for his success.
"He was an adult, and was not a proud person," he said.
"But because Paddington was real to her, it was difficult for her to have a child to accomplish something: she is proud of it though not really.
I think he had observed Paddington’s success that way.
Although he was his creation and concept, he always owed him a debt to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to speak on the phone
His daughter had been rushed to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors performed vain autopsies to save her life.
"UNad always called it wrong, if he didn't expect her to do it," said Nsz Edna-Laperouse.
"After that I received a phone call from Nad if he said he would die within two minutes and I had to tell him.
I’m desperate.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much."
I will be with you soon.
I’ll be with you.
Her doctor had given her the strength to keep her heart beating faster and to abandon her system.
He needed some time before his hand was placed, and this was all close.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that it all happened.
I could not cry or cry or cry because I was put in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold together.
Finally Sir Edna-Laperouse, now sadly because of the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers unaware of her problem.
"No one knew," he said.
“ I was touching my head, and tears were heard all the time.
It is hard to explain, but I felt this kind of kindness toward Nad.
If he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her.
Extracting cards to prevent suicides from falling on the block
Two women who lost their loved one to commit suicide try to save their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to the Welsh Bridge with encouraging messages and telephone numbers to call for support.
Tyler's son, Msz Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I would feel every day," he said.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infection.
"Everyone knew it because of his smile.
They always meant her smile.
Even so, he quit the job before he died, as 'he was in a dark place.'
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who could find his brother after he was alive.
Msz Davis said: "I always worry that there will be a knock."
Ms Davis created cards, "Let people know that there are people on the outside, even if they are friends.
Don't be quiet - you have to talk.
Msz Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Ns Davies, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after Mom died.
‘ Not that he was feeling down or depressed or anything,' he said.
"Just a few days before Christmas we noticed her change in attitude.
She was on the lowest road at Christmas when the children opened their presents, she didn't agree with anything.
He said that his death was a great victim to them, but they should work with him: "He boasts of the hole in the family.

The future of Brett Kavanough depends on the registration as the FBI initiates research
"I thought, if we could find something like the one that asked for it at a time, it is limited to time - perhaps we are bringing in little unity," says Mr Flake on Saturday, he added that he was running away from the committee "among the gridlock together.
Why do Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of interest is due to time.
The election is at the end of the five - week term, November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do wrong, so they will be very weak in their efforts to find the man they want to be elected to the highest court of the world.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the Senators, asking to support Mr Kavanugh, who worked in the West House in Mr Bush and met with him and his wife Ashley, who was secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI released its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where the Republic and Democratic are now seated.
It is still still clear that Mr. Kavanough can reach 50 votes on the level of the Senate, which will allow Mike Pance, the president, to break the case and convince him of the Supreme Court.
North Korea User Number's Failure's ID under Kim
The number of North Koreans to South Korea has fallen from Kim Jong-un was strong seven years ago, said the South Korean President.
The Park Yeong-seug, which mentioned the chart from South relations service, said there was security for 1,127 last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that control is limited to the border between North Korea and China and high levels paid by chief counterfeiters.
Pyongy did not create public opinion.
Most of the orphans in North are eventually donated by South Koreans.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Americans have illegally crossed the line since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority fled China, the longest border in North Korea, and it is easy to cross the Dilitised Zone (DMZ) Valley between the two Koreans.
China is referred to as illegal migrants rather than runaways and repeatedly return again and again.
The connection between the North and South - which has been legally acting in the war over the next months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of two countries met at Pyongyang with a speech aimed at riddles.
This occurred after the June historical meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work on the uninterrupted Korean peninsula.
But Saturday, North Korean Minister Ri Yong-ho says that the US penalties are due to lack of progress.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not use it for the first time," says Mr. Ri in a speech at the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelos calls Brett Kavanough "tax," that she is not prepared to serve in the Supreme Court.
The junior House Chief Nancy Pelos called the High Court Highman Brett Kavanough "trough" and said he was unfit to serve in the High Court.
Philo provided answers to the Saturday conversation in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think if a woman has done such a thing, they're going to take advantage of it," Peter said about his reply to Kavanough before the Court of Appeals on Thursday.
Kavanough was officially permitted to smoke sex with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
During the opening hours, Kavanough was very moody, sometimes screaming and joined in discussions about his family and his high school years.
He clearly judged democracys in the committee, calling for criticism on the "compliance and social co-ordination" pursued by rare institutions if Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 national option.
Philo said that he believed that Kavanough could not serve in the High Court, since it showed that he was being abused by Democrats.
‘ I think you are ready for such explanations and how the Clintons and Democratics, ’ he said.
Peter was stressed when he was asked that he would try to disturb the Kavanough if he was assured, and that Democratic accession is made to the House of the Representatives.
"I'll mean this - if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, so he isn't qualified to be the Supreme Court, but to be in the present court," Peter said.
The Kavanaugh currently judges in D.C.
Peter added that as a democracy he was concerned about the judgment of Kavanough Act or Roe v. even, as it is considered to be a last justice.
In his conviction of imprisonment, the Kavanough had answered questions about whether he could change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a person who is dangerous, privately to go to court and waits for us to say, 'that' is nothing,' said Peter.
And wives want to protect it.
A good diatribe, a month and years of hot flashes, and cannot do it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrsz Steinem said to me after 45.
"I don't think about something strange, don't I?"
He went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a certain ruler in a certain place, who also cried when she cried, but developed a procedure that meant that when she was full of crying, she said to the man who spoke to her, "You think I am sorry because I cry."
I'm angry.
And she kept going.
And I thought it was wise.
Tears are allowed as a result of misunderstanding.
One of my most sharpest reminders of my former career, in a male-man-saged office, where I found myself crying in uncontrolled anger, was a scruff on my neck by an elderly woman - I’m always afraid of it - who is pulling me up on the platform.
"Never let them see them crying," he told me.
"He doesn't know that he is angry.
They think you are sad and you will be happy because they come to you.
Patricia Schroeder, then the Democraticboman Society of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidentship.
In 1977, when Mr Hart was caught in a pasture outside a vessel called the Shinkey and came out of the race, Mrsz Schroeder, he was very concerned, he might think that there was no reason for him to miss the idea of running the president himself.
‘ There was no rational decision, ’ she said with laughter after 30 years.
"There were seven heard in this race, and the last thing they wanted was one.
One called the " Snow White and the Seven Favorites."
Because it was after the campaign, it was after financial support, and she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she had raised $2 million.
It was a lost war.
He found that some of his supporters who contributed 1,000 to the men would give him only $250.
‘ Did they think I was getting a loss?' She wondered.
When he made a speech informing him that he would not perform an official campaign, he was suffering from feelings - thanking the people who supported him, frustration and a system that made it more difficult to raise money and direct votes than delegates, and anger at sexism - if he became mature.
"You think I'm going to be disturbed," recalls Mrssz Schroeder about how the printer responded to him.
"You think Kleenex was my company's supporter.
I remember thinking, ‘ Will they put it on my rock? ’
"She stayed"? "
How the US-Canada trade war can be a beautiful thing at Beijing
The salvos opening of the U.S. trade war between China was deaf, and while the conflict is far away, conflicts between countries can be useful to Beijing for a long time, experts say.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, dismissed the first warning at the beginning of the year by means of anthropomorphic Chinese talk including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The significant increase has been corrected this week by new costs affecting $200 billion (£15 Billion) cost, which is ideal for all US tax from China.
Beijing is repeated again and again in a hurry, with more recently paying for fiber to ten per cent of America’s $60 million.
China has promised to identify US shot-shhot-shhot, and much of the world's economy will not be able to combine any time in the near future.
To get Washington to come down means to take the requirements, but to bow to the United States will be very embarrassing to Xi Jinping, president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards properly, the force of U.S. wars can certainly help China more than long by reducing international dependence.
"The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that begin to throw us off economically in this country is indeed more dangerous than observers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, a senior friend toward Asia, says the New American Security Culture, a thinking tank.
Syria 'in preparing the refugees to return, says the Chief Minister of the Nations
Syria recommends a voluntary return to refugees and encourages the reconstruction of a nation that was ravaged by war for over seven years.
When speaking at the United Nations General Walid al-Mualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the Underground conditions are certainly thankful for the progress made in preventing violence," he said.
The State continues to rebuild areas damaged by the cover so that they can restore habit.
All present are the voluntary return of refugees to a country where violence and nonviolent economic conditions have led them to their daily lives and to their lives.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrian refugees since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who live in the country are in dire need of help.
And Al-Moulem said that the kingdom of Syria shall receive help to rebuild a land that is destroyed.
But he stressed that he would not accept compulsory assistance or assistance from countries where he had supported.
