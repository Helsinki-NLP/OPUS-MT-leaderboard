Welsh Ams are concerned that ‘ they will look like a flat'
They ask themselves and others among the AMs in the view that they have changed their MWPs (Mumber of the Welsh Paraliament).
This is removed from the reformation programs of the reunification of the Welsh Parliament.
The Ams of all political parties fear that this will call them ridicule.
Another member of the Labour AM said they were afraid because there is a noise similar to Twp and Pwp.
To students outside of Wales: According to Welsh Welsh let tup means stupid and pwp means waste.
A member of the Plaid AM group was happy and then provided other names for which to be selected.
The Welsh Conservative member said that as a group they were willing to accept the change of the name but noted that MWP is much closer to being addressed by the bullet.
According to Welsh letter W is the same as the U character in Yorkshire England.
This General Assembly commission, which repeats the policy of a change of the term, said: "The final decision by identifying this will be a matter which will be the common case by the board members."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 granted the Welsh organisation the right to change their name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public poll in favor of ideas, which received a major reunification of the organization called the Welsh parliament.
In the case of the MMs commission, the WMP is established and the community opinion has shown reliance on MWP.
The Ams have included their own opinions, but the match will be a problem for Ellin Jones, who is in charge of the making of the concrete board in the next weeks.
Repetition regulations will involve the transformation of the current method of the door, involving the anti-M and the planning of the division.
The AMs will have the final word on what they will be called when the law is discussed.
The Macedonians went to the polling votes in the name of their country.
The voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether they will change their country's name into the Republic of North Macedonia.
This open voting appears after attempting to resolve an issue that took decades in the history of neighboring Greece with its Macedonian state.
Athens has long held its claim that its upper neighbors are not the only countries to take part of their own country, and that it has earlier challenged the efforts of Macedonia to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjoge Ivanov opposed to the change of the name and said that the vote would ignore it.
However, supporters of a change of the word we mention Chief Zoran Zaev saw this as a condition to be made to become members of the EU and NATO.
It is the village village of the Bells of stmarins for the difficulties faced by the congregations in Harlem.
"From a historical standpoint, older persons with whom I have consulted said that there was a week and a place to dry and dry in every street," he put Mr. Adams.

Mr. David Johnson, son and successor of Mhu. Johnsosn called him a bell of the poor.
A nurse playing the bells in July said: "Man’s jewel" and "a symbol of history which has not been removed.
The University of Michigan engineer Tiffany Ng said that for the first time on earth it had turned to the metal for the first time by the black musician Dinnisio A. Lind, who continued to play the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
St Martins Congregation has not closed your space. Mr. Merwiather.
What happened a few months ago in St Martins was a factory of cooks and concrete, some of whom were captured by congregation leaders and others were brought in by the records.

Some members of the congregation wept over the fact that they did not go out in public.

Their method of playing with them has not changed since they return from the gin, but we should commend Holt for the way he prepared the team for coming.
You have won a number of champions.
Captain Halket has been prominent, his wall standing firm, while Menga kept Conn or Goldon and Joe Worroll stared at the whole game.
The Rangers were running, but.
Or they do well under the rule of Gerhard, so they have failed to keep those standards to a minimum.
Their last hatches are-- Once they have opened the home hole – Rangers must rise from the eggs, as they find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
They were en masse and the sky blue on Saturday (dulmo 29) as the Turks and German gathered in Berlin for breakfast.
The final day of this dubious visit by President Erdogan in Germay – aim to repair the relationship between NATO and his friends.
Disagreements over such matters as the rights of people, the freedom of journalists, and the exodus of Turkey from the EU have occurred.
Erdogan is going to depart to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to many of the Turks outside of Turkey.
Police patrol security conditions as they have prevented 25,000 people from standing in front of the mosque, but there are many isolated criminals nearby to see their president.
Thousands of unconventional Eldogans are most of them kurush-and want their words to be heard, taking into account the law of Erdogan and the German government now accept him into the country.
This presentation points to differences of opinion by a seemingly decisive visitor to the German Turks and as an opposition to others.

Hurricane Rosa strikes Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (the drought - stricken areas will melt)
It is not uncommon for a hurricane to strike Arizona, but what will happen at the start of the week next week as Hurricane Rosa forces continue to approach desert areas in the Southwest, bringing with them the dangers of flooding.
Heavens astrologers have already issued a warning that you watch the floods on Mondays and Tuesdays in West Arizona to the south and east, in southeastern Carlifia and Utah, counting the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa expects him to take the route over the Phoenix on Tuesday, coming Monday with rain.
Astronomers in Phoenix said of Tutter’s message that only 10 were the last quake within 200 miles [200 km] of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane between 25 miles [40 km] and AZ trail.
The National Hurician Center predicts two to four inches [4 to 4 cm] of rain, accompanied by a 6 - inch [6 cm] figure in Mogollan Rim in Arizona.
Some desert areas in the Southwest counted between the Rockies and the Great Basin are expected to find 1 to 8 inches [1 to 2 cm].
With such risks, Rosa would do well to be a blessing while half of her body was suffering from drought.
If the floods are very dangerous, one of the rain will be a reward because in the South West it is struck by drought.
According to the U.S. Drugth Monitor (see the drought), 40 percent of Arizona's drought attacks, which is the second largest in the list, of the ather.com is full.
First, storm Rosa is to pass before Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still strong on Sunday morning as we travel 35 miles per hour 85 miles per hour [385 km / hr], with Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and up to the north at a speed of 12 miles [12 km] an hour.
The storm draws closer to calm waters in the Pacific and is therefore threatening to drop out of power.
Thus, it is expected that we will be hit by a tropical storm in the afternoon or Monday.
Rain in a number of places in Mexico can be heavy, potentially damaging by flood.
Rains range from 3 to 6 inches [3 to 6 cm] BAja California to northwestern Sonara, with less than four inches [10 cm], white.com reported.
Rosa will be going up north as a storm before she reaches Arizona’s second - morning highway, going up through Arizona and entering South Utah at midnight on a second.
The great potential danger that Rosa could create or that she left heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonara, and U.S. Desert Southwest, says the National Hurician Cente.
These rains are expected to produce floodwaters that flow with the soul as well as crystals that flow into plants and mountain ranges.

"Judauvaugh's vote is to abandon the painless and offensive tactics at Democratic Party," says Trump at the conference of Wheeling, West Virginia.
The Trump said that Kavanough has been "suffered, anger" of the Democratic Party for all his promotional process.

Hundreds were killed by the magnitude of the earth, tsunami, and the number rising
After at least 384 people have died, many have been swept away by great waves during horse attacks, when an earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia’s peninsula of Sulawesi, the authorities say on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a party on the beach in Palu town on Friday when the 18-aft waves were hit in the bank at nine o'clock, killing many at their deaths and destroying anything in the way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 15 feet [7.5 m].
"When the tsunamis arose on Thursday, people were doing their work on the beach and did not rush and become victims," says Sutopo Puro Nugroho, commenting on Indonesia, in an attack on disaster at BNPB.
"The tsunami didn't arrive alone, dragged the cars, the timbers, the houses, hit everything on the ground," says Nucroho, adding that the tsunami was crossing the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the sands.
Some people climb into the trees to escape the Tsunami, he says.
Some 17,700 people were moved to 24 facilities in Palu.
The aerial photos released by the disaster center showed dozens of buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed and broken down, and the water - inundated station.
The quake continues to move a coastal city for a whole Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was known in the area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Applications of Technology (BPT) says that the power generated by the big earthquake on Friday was 200 percent the power of an atom bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
City geography, sitting at the end of a long half, smaller, may have increased the size of a tsunami, they said.
Nugro described such damage as "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and destroyed hotels.
Members of some victims have been found trapped under a collapsed housing drum, he said, holding back the 540 injured persons and 29 died.
Nucroho has said that those injured and damaged may be as large as 200 miles [300 km] north of Palu, a place called Dongga, near the quacker e.ke.
Connection "unknown" has no information" from Donggala, namely Nucroho.
There are more than 300,000 people who live there, "the Red Cross in the middle, which adds that its crew and volunteers go to the affected areas.
It is said, ‘ This is already a tragedy but is still worse than this.'
The generals on Saturday were widely criticized for not meaning that the tsunami was hit in Palu, although the authorities say that the water had arrived at the time that the warning was issued.
The video delivered to the social environment may sound a call to warn of a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes the sea wall, which removes buildings and vehicles.
The Reuters could not immediately verify the video accuracy.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused electricity loss and communications to make it difficult for officers to guide relief efforts.
The soldiers that have begun to transport cargo from Jakarta and other cities, says the authorities, but the survivors need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is only open to relief efforts and will be closed up until October.
President Joko Seddon is scheduled to visit parks in Palus on Sunday.
Indonesia Tsunami Toll rises over 800.
It is very serious.
When World Vision workers came from Dongga, they lived in a safer area in Pallu, where the workers lived in shelters built in their office yard, they introduced drugs along the way, says Mr. Dobe.
They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed, and said.
It’s worse.
Even as relief teams began to explode in the form of emergency equipment, some complained that the well - informed foreign workers had been prevented from leaving Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, goods, and crews from abroad could begin to penetrate if the disaster site is called a national disaster zone.
That does not happen.
"It's not just a state disaster" says Aulia Arriani, Commenting on the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government said, 'O good, this is a global disaster,' we should allow foreign aid but it is not yet possible."
As the two night falls in Palu after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, friends and family of those still alive looked forward to the miracle of healing natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the tent.
On Sunday, the nurses released a woman who had been trapped under a rag for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gemon Subandono, an Indonesian instructor, has trained two disabled persons who are lost in Asian sports, which are linked at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped in a hotel in Roa Roa, says Mr. Mandag, were his disciples.
He says: ‘ As an elder in the field of disability, I have the warmth of my load.
Gemon explained that, hours after the news service of the Roa Roa Hotel laughing in the middle of the paragliding middle, he had sent the Whats App to the Palu competition, which became part of the beach feast.
His messages, however, produce a single gray symbol, rather than a blue string.
"I think that means that the messages are not sent," he says.

Once West: you changed his position to Ye.
Marine Kane West alters his name as Ye.
To announce a change to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "He is known as One."
West, 41 years old, has been named by playtime and has used the moniker as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday night, when he was expected to start his new Yandi album.
He put the Ariana Grande on a display that has demanded "for reasons of his spirit," says the founder of the program.
As well as being a summary of his modern technical name, West says before that the name has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that 'he' is the term most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,' says West at the beginning of the year, speaking of his album title and Big Boy radio.
"I am you, and I am he, and we will say one another.
They came from Conson, meaning only to Him, just to show good, evil, our confusion, all.
A album is more than who we are.
He is one of the most famous authors to change their name.

Mexican AMLO does not want to use war against citizens
Mexico’s President selected by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will not use an army against citizens as the country approaches 50 years of blood invasion against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatolco Plaza "Never use troops to pressure Mexicans."
Police are turned on a peaceful plastic display on October 2, 1968, which killed about 300 people at the time when the movement of the helicopter students was focused throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support the young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those who read and open many public universities free of charge.
He says that unemployment and a lack of access to education draws young people into crime clubs.
The U.S should increase A.I support.
Since China is more active in I.A., the U.S. should double the number that uses research in the field, say financial support and AI, Kai- Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
An amendment from the aftermost sides of the U.S. state has made a declaration to the AI, just as the general U.S. system does not have an accurate plan for AI.
During that time, China began its program last year: intended to be in AI in 2030.
"AI research economy will be a good start, as all other countries are too far behind the U.S., and we want the next success to AI," says Lee.
Disagreements and funding may multiply the probability of a major AI fulfillment in the U.S., Lee tells the CNBC to discuss this week.
Lee, her book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harbor, Director of the Sivan Ventures, which is planted in one of China's most important AI companies, Face +.
In the 1980 ’ s Carnegie Mellon University worked on a new AI program by an American Othello player, and later the manager of Microsoft Research and the President of the China branch
Lee agreed to the former U.S. technical competition as the Lobotics Challenge Department and asked when the next one would be, to help see the next.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to overcome government resources, says Lee.
"No China removes academic leaders; they are companies," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other high - tech companies have used lights from universities to work on AI years later.
Lee said that changes in the goal of migration would also help the U.S. to reinforce their AI efforts.
"I think green cards should automatically be surgically operated on PhDs on AI," says.
The Chinese Council of China released the development of the next General Intelligent Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
The China National Natural Science Foundation has given money to people at educational institutions such as the way the National Science Foundation and others spend money on researchers, but the work unit of academics is small in China, says Lee.
Early in the year. The Defense Department that replaced the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must include the department’s administration as well as the experts, and the White House announces the building of a special body of Artificial Intelligence.
This month the DARPA proclaimed $2 billion in a program called AI Text.
The NSF, grew at $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, the American National Security Commission’s Constitution on the Artificial Intelligence has not gone away.
Macedonians vote whether to change the name of the country.
The Macedonians have voted on Sunday to sign the name of the country into the " Republic of North Macedonia," a bomb to resolve a conflict with the Greek country that still holds the virtue of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its province, goes on to say that its northern neighbors want their land and want to enter the NATO and EU.
Both governments make a treaty of agreement, but some say that changing the term means undermining the culture of most Macedonians and Slavs
President Gjoge Ivanov stated that he would not vote and protest vote makes it doubtful that 50 percent of the people will come until the election is legally established.
The question on the election paper reads: "You agree with the membership of NATO and EU with the Greek agreement."
Conversant with the name change, Prime Minister Zan Zaev, says that it is what you pay now that you accept stamps such as the EU and Nato in Macedonia, some of the lands that have just been torn apart by the breakup of Yugoslavia
"I came yesterday to vote for our country's still, so that young Macedonians would be better off under the umbrella of the European Union because it describes all our dead health," says Oliverra Georgijevska, 79, Skopje.
If not legally bound, the sufficient members in the parliament have said that the vote will receive it.
The change will take two parts of three to eat a parliament meeting.
The country’s polling commission said that there were no reports to disagree on 1 p.m.
Yet, it was still in 16 percent, more than 34 per percent of previous parliamentary votes in 2016 in 66 percent of the presidents registered in their votes.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, a mayor in the city, Skopje.
PM of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and her son Dushko voted in Macedonia by changing the name of the country that would open the way to join the NATO and European Union in Strumica, Macedonia Sembenho 30, 2018.
Before parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavararkov, 54, was preparing the scene and pulling the chairs in front of the tents set by those who would take up the balance.
"We can't be NATO and the EU, but we want to join and set our heads, not by the office door" says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but of dignity.
If they don't want to accept it as Macedonians, we can convert others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asianization.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will bring the needed currency in Macedonia, with an average of more than 20 per cent unemployed.
"I believe that the majority of the 80 per cent of our population will join the EU and NATO," says Zaev after putting on a badge.
He said "Yes" the results of "Confirmation of our future."
Early parrots were printed at Macedonia's Institute for Political Research and between 30 and 43 per cent of votes to share – under expectations.
One parrot, owned by Macedonia's Telma TV, is a little girl 57 percent who answered her plans to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent says that you vote.
For the ransomerum to be a success, it must be 50 percent per cent and one vote.
A failure of referendom will present a major problem for the pro- Western Government that lasted a long time in May last year.
View: Sergei Aguero of Manchester City crosses the walls of all Brighton walls to dry
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling set down the Brighton wall in the Battle of Manchester City on a Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very simple in his 65 - minute article.
The Argentine lookout is thrown into the stomach at the beginning of the preparation.
He has played among three of Brighton’s coverrs, before crossing the stadium.
Aguero finds himself surrounded by four green T - shirts.
He squeezes the other guard before passing through another pile in the Brighton box.
Then she laments her left side, finding Sterling.
The foresail touches the ball in the box just to bring it back to the Aguero, who uses his right bull to conquer the Brighton Manaw Ryan's heel with the left-hand edge of the net.
"Aguero still faces problems at his feet," City administrator Pep Guardola informs the press.
"We told her that they played for 55 minutes, or 60 minutes.
That’s what has happened.
We've been fortunate for him to pull the goal in it for just a while.
But it was the Sterling that gave the Sky Blues at the beginning of the Premier League cycle.
The truck will appear in the second half of the 29th.
Aguero has found a ball in the volume of the Brighton players in that game.
You sent a nice ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane said to touch it before taking the lead in Sterling toward the pole.
The Sky Blues guards touched the ball and entered into a can and almost went out.
City is synonymous with Hoffenheim in Champions League for a game that will be playing at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday Tuesday in Rhein-Necker-Area in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play on proxy match. With Rockies
The National Group has been moved in a show-off race, no longer having reason to force another start.
But a prospective Sccherzer wishes to enter the stadium on Sunday and face Colorado Rockies, this may be all the way if the Rockies face problems in the balloffs, while winning a single game by holding the Los Angeles Dodlers in the West and NL.
Rockies still hold a single hatch of the wid-card by winning 52 when it has already met the Nationals on Friday, but they are still looking to hold their first fair assembly.
"If there's no play for us, it's still left that when it comes to the Denver state of its followers and this one team will be playing at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
What will make me not want to play there?
Nationals are not yet publishers to play on Sunday, but it sounds as if they can let Scherzer enter the race.
Scherzer, who may be in 34 years, had a bullpen ring on Thursday and will be on Sunday of his rest day.
The Washington right-handed right fighter has 2,53 RA and 220 strikeots in 2/3 inns in this country.
Trump races in West Virginia
The president removed his speech from the atmosphere surrounding his choice of Brett Kavanough to the Supreme Court when stressing the importance of the exodus of Republicans to internal elections and leadership.
"All that we have done is in the ticket by November.
Five weeks before this decision is most important to our health.
This is one of the big ones, especially -- I'm not running but can say that I am running because I am full of struggling for the best seatmen, according to him.
Trump has continued, ‘ You see this terrible, horrible group of sub-divided Democrats, which you see right now.
And they are willing to return to power in any way they can, just look at cruelty, and uncleanness.
They don't care who they are doing harm to whom, and who's to rule and gain power, that's what they want to control and power, which he will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, are in a "constitution and disruption" campaign.
"And when you look at the last four days," he said, "Don't call the Democrats "offens, fierce, unclean and without truth."
He then refers to the Senate Committee that he calls Sen. Democratic Feinstein by name, which has attracted him to the masses.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you run the document?
Look, here I am!
No, no, I said that taking one stand - by his stand has not brought me good news - I have never seen man’s stand so ugly.
The Labor Group is no longer a congregation of anyone.
They no longer speak up in their minds.
When the Momentum champions in my group came to the door to close my mouth, I was not surprised at all.
But then, I have entered later the MMP class group of employees who have been told that they are not welcome - simply because of the speech in our imagination.
My friend Joan Ryan of Parliament has received almost the same treatment because of opposition to the Semitics.
In my case, those who wanted me to be banned accused me of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the matter of the importance of the proposed financial system, national security, Europe, and other surprises that Jeremy has had earlier conflict with other leaders.
In the report of the Nottingham East Service Group for the Friday meeting, it is "We want meetings without prejudice and benefit them."
Throughout the past year I have been the company MMP for my local work group, the five - day GC meetings have always been the same.
Sadly, today it doesn't go like modern assemblies and the promise of "fellow feeling, kindness" has long been forgotten if, indeed, we have ever existed.
It becomes increasingly evident that differing views are no longer allowed in the work force and that opinions are judged as acceptable to gang leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, who said that we had similar political views, have also decided that I would take sides that I would not agree with - whether for national security or for an EU market.
Whenever I speak in public - it is no longer necessary or if a wave of harassment comes on the social network tells me to be expelled, it tears down politics, telling me that I should not be part of the work force.
And I’m not the only one who still has this to deal with.
I know, however, that I have been more fortunate than my fellows because the talks referred to me still prefer to be political.
I'm amazed that my colleagues still hold them in the service and their determination not to identify themselves even in the face of sexual or racial discrimination.
One of the most depressing features of this political period is the way the forms of torture have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said that last week a Labour priority should set a standard of limits.
The fact is that we no longer see this great church and have no confidence in itself or in the changing laws to pick up a group are on the decline.
I have had many suggestions over the past two years being urged to be low, not to talk too much and it will be "I'm ready."
But I was no longer involved in politics.
Since I met Labour 32 years ago as a student, I have been upset by the government Thatcher for not having left broken school meetings, wanting to bring the best public services to those in need – perhaps as a local government or as a government minister.
I have never tried to hide from politics, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East could in any way be confused about the law of the mayor and the controversy of the current leadership.
For those who encourage the ride on Friday, all I can say is that when the world moves ahead to Brexit that will distract householders, businesses and our public service, I do not wish to spend my time and energy honestly on the director of the Labor Party.
But I really have one message that I do not have in Nottingham Movementum, to mine, whether members of the Laboratory or not: I am stealing from you by serving you and I promise that there will be no threat or political restraint that will prevent me from doing what I believe would be the best for all of you.

Ayr has 38-17 Melrose: Ayr never broken on top
Two recent tries have broken the last results, but no doubt Ayr is worthy of commendation for the modern high-level Tennet's Premiership game.
Now they are divine, that is, cheating on the side of the defeated ten.
In the end, their defense, whenever possible, puts family members and educator Peter Murchie all the reasons for happiness.
He said, "All our games have been tested up to now, and we have never been defeated, so I must be happy."
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Respect for Ayr, take advantage of every opportunity beyond us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minant Anger is installed by Fziier Climo, which puts Ayr ahead, but, rap Rory Hughes of the socland received a yellow card, released from the match Warriors, which caused Melrose to make herself by rats and Jason Baggot to hold all the commands.
Climo saw Ayr went forward with a penpad, just before, on the first end, and installed that try to make 17-5 on Ayr a break.
But Melrose in the second stage began well, and Patrick Anderson's disease, replaced by Baggot, was reduced by five points.
Then there is time arrest due to severe damage to Ruaradh Knott, which was pulled out by a plaster, when it was removed and Ayr vigorously went forward with Stafford McDowall's dwindling, installed by the Clivy.
The Ayr captain was then given a yellow card, and, again, Melrose borrowed heavily with Bruce Colvine's try, at the last power.
My family had returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson found a yellow dollar after touching Climo without carrying a ball, without the line of the pen, MacPerson touched the ground against Ayr.
Climo insert, as he did earlier, after Kyle Rowe meets David Armstrong ball sending David Armstrong on the family's side in the fifth try.

‘ The sea is ours. Bolivia’s authorities hope that the court will open the Pacific road.
Watchers of the crew of the rigging-clad headquarters and al in La Paz.
Line-blocks lift the flag or flag-blue.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have this slogan: "The sea is our right.
Recovery is our job.
In all parts of Bolivia, the memory of a sealine was lost in Chile in the 19th century, the spring is still clear - as it is eager to go to the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may be high in your years, Bolivia is expected to be ruled by an international court of Justice on October 1.
"A Bolivia has Power, spirit of solidarity and submission, and is, in effect, ready for you," says Roberto Calladilla, who speaks officially for Bolivia.
Many in Bolivia will watch ICJ rubing at large screens everywhere, with great hope that the Hague court will reap Bolivia’s complaints that – after many years of talks – Chile is forced to negotiate by giving Bolivia control of part of the sea.
Evo Morales, a suitable president of Bolivia – facing a long election - the next year has much to do on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," vowing towards August.
But some analysts believe that the court is less likely to defend Bolivia - whereas the name will change if it permits.
The Netherlands - supporting UN body has the power to crown the Chilean areas, affirming that the success of the speeches can be determined.
That the ICJ rubings came only in the months following the arguments made it clear that the case was "not hard," says the international legal observer of Chile, Paz Zárate.
Far from realizing Bolivia's objectives, the last four years may have put them back.
"The issue of sea service has been illegally affected by Bolivia's authorities," says Zarate.
Morales' speech that encouraged violence is crippling the cohesion of Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will move on for some time, but it will be very difficult to continue the discussion after this.
Two countries have not changed one another by agency since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, who represented Bolivia in Hague, has dismissed the suspicion that the court is too quick to decide.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new partnership with Chile" and the opportunity to "set up 139 years of disrepair for the benefit of both countries", and put it.
Calcutta also denies that Morales – one of Latin American’s most famous presidents – used maritime subjects as the basis of politics.
"A Bolivia will never discard its contribution to the use of the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is an opportunity to prove that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says that stopping nuclear weapons will not be possible unless they can trust America.
The North Korean foreign minister R Yong Ho says that his country will not stop nuclear weapons from going ahead unless they trust Washington.
Ri has been speaking on Saturday in the conference of the United Nations.
He has appealed to America to follow his promises that he made at a Singapore conference among rival leaders.
Her observation until the time of America. The secretary of state Mike Pompio appears to be at the first point of a nuclear revolution three months after Singapore and Kim Jonun of North Korea.
Ri says it is an unrealistic dream that the ongoing threat and refusal of the U.S. in a treaty that ends the war in Korea will cause North Korea to bow down.
Washington is well aware of his refusal to make announcements before the Pyongyy begins to destroy his weapons.
Both Kim and U.S. / America President Donald Trump needs a second conference.
However, there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is willing to give up weapons that the world may view as the only way to safety.
Pompio plans to visit Pyongyng in the coming month for the second assembly of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows much of the headwear that comes to the store next to you
If you want to expand your hats or simply block the sun completely from looking far away.
The cobblers Valentino and Thom Browne have displayed a list of large head hats in their SS19 armpits on the Paris Fax show.
Unbelievable hats are filled in the Instaggrams this summer, and the weavers bring eyepieces.
The bright light of Valentino was a long hat on the sides of the ashtray with feathers and feathers over the head of the model model.
Some large - scale objects include jewelry, a witch’s hat.
Thomas Browne to reveal unusual facial expressions during Halloween.
Most masks in the mouth look like Hannibal Lecter rather than the design of the best designers.
Another design, similar to underwater diving, has a respiratory system and some glasses.
If you persist in a fad or fashion that is not popular, you can put yourself in danger.
Cartons were aware that large hats would likely be on their way to large shopping malls.
The main hat is soon followed by ‘La Bomba', a two-footed hat that is about the opening of this sunscreen, which appears in Rihanna's "evonna" to Emily Ratajkowski.
The basic religious symbol of a dubious hat that is popular in the communications pages has sent other goods to the exhibition - a sea bag about the size of a swimming pool shown by the admirer.
A burning orange bag made up of the cavia tree, ended up with the net, was worn with white skin on the handle, and went alone on the Jacquemus'La Riviera SS19 in the fashion exhibition in Paris.
The famous wearer Luke Aritage told FEMAIL: ‘ I expect to see large hats and seabs arrive at stores in the next summer as the weavers have a major impact it will be difficult to deny the need to do things more in a scale.'
John Edward: A good farming ability is important for the inhabitants of the continent.
The independent schools in Scotland keep a record of good results, and this has been carried on by the year 2018 with other positive results, guaranteed only by success in sports, art, music, and other public endeavors.
With a rude number of thirty thousand students in Scotland, the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), they are moving towards a higher level of assistance.
Private schools are designed to prepare students to enter the highest educational, field, and environment they choose as citizens.
As a educational department that can organize and open a special educational program, we see modern farming continues to be a popular and popular field as a school curriculum.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak to a man in the language you hear, what you say goes straight to his head."
When you speak with him in his tongue what you say goes right to the heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot always trust English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other lands.
From the results of a survey of this year’s tests, we can see that the farm’s top top in the chimney is being achieved in large numbers in private schools.
There are eight-eight-in-all students who have studied the foreign fields and have received the higher section A.
Statistics, gathered in seventy-four ScIS schools, show that seventy-two percent of students have received High Class A in Mandarin, since another seventy-two percent learn German, sixty-n percent of those who have learned French for another sixty-three years learned Spanish and have received A.
This indicates that foreign schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as valuable skills for children, young people in no doubt will need them in the future.
Farm now as a study in which you can choose, it is considered to be similar in academic and academic subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) at schools that are independent of the curriculum and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employmery and Skills in 2014 found that 17 per cent of the language deficiency of employers was caused by the shortage of language skills.
For the most part, language skills are becoming more important in preparing youths for employment opportunities.
With many of the anticipated tasks of language testing, these are vital skills in a united world.
Whatever field a person takes, if they learn the second language, they put themselves in a better position in the future to develop the same skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country puts a man able to speak many different languages in front of his rivals.
According to a UK study of more than 4 thousand adults (4,000) in 2013, seventeen-five percent of them were unable to speak well foreign territory and have good communication and French is the only two-inch population growing in numbers, fifteen percent.
That is why farming of agriculture is important to today’s children.
Having a lot of land knowledge, especially in those developing lands, will help to give children a better chance of finding a better job.
In Scotland, school and school vary in their language.
Most schools focus mainly on teaching older and more modern agriculture, and some teach UK crops that are considered most important in the UK in view of the year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child likes you, there are many different kinds of farming that you can choose from private schools, and help the experts in the area.
Scotland’s private schools are committed to providing educational structure to prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, this time in the future.
At present, it is denied to the international business world that agriculture will continue to play an important role in the future of the world, so this must be shown in education.
In fact, modern crops must be included in "international communications skills."
The private schools will continue to give up this opportunity, variety, and intelligence to young Scottish people.
You have to do well.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

President Donald Trump starts the storm of the race with an automobile race at night in Wheeling, West Virginia.
The first of Trump in the fifth week planned, including standing in the gathering spaces counted by Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote for a vote that will shut the courtroom, Trump aims to build followers in this medieval choice as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the council on Sunday.
Trump's choice of West Virginia, when will it start?
Trump's election race at Wheeling, West Virginia will begin at seven o'clock in the evening. ET at night, Saturday, 29 Early 2018.
You can view Trump's choice in West Virginia by joining YouTube to see what is happening now.
Trump may lead the church’s suspicions to the higher court, Brett Kavanough, accused of sexual offenses with a prospective Senate vote while the FBI is investigating.
But the base of the storm of the campaign will help the Republicans to find the strength to cope with the choice of the English.
Thus, President Trump in his campaign said these five motor vehicles a week later he intended "to give enthusiasm to the volunteers and followers as the Republicans try to protect and increase their client population," according to Reuters.
"Adviation of the board is important to the president's plans for a number of countries which can be visited as it moves towards the busy time of the campaign" denies the mouth of the Trump campaign that prevents Reuters to reveal his name.
Written by Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today’s auto races can bring followers from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh communications network, according to West Virginia Metro News.

The Ryder Reserve 2018 The American team hopes to fight and keep the hopes available in one day games on Sunday.
After the three - side assembly, Saturday afternoon, these Ryder Cup games may have been four times more likely.
A weapon of total intensity is the stage that is set, but the players believe in it, which can be compared.
Where, then, would they decide in terms of power now?
"They take the lead in six points and are now four, so we continue as if with a little power I think I'm thinking" says Jordan Spieth as they drive slowly in the day.
Europe has a chance, indeed, four points forward to twenty-two.
Americans, as he pointed out, have little joy and much to be encouraged, not by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play together all day and who each has three to four points.
Spiegel has been dangerous and has taken the lead in an example.
Those who watched were very happy when he was, the patience of the golf course is essential for a game to fit in with Thomas himself.
His golf won the game with 15 the same thrill, this means he believes that the American team is still going out.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your game," says Spiegel.
There are now one of the remaining players.
18 mines to mark them.
The only player more skilled than Spieth and Thomas two days ago was the Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, not questioned at the Ryder Cup.
Europe's dend is a very slow and willing wedding.
"Moliwood" is the only hours that don't start a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but avoid the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
This race, based on the pressure of the two, comes from the noisy crowd who conclude that they are the winners on Sunday, and no other well - known athletes will be more enthusiastic about winning the European victory as the sun falls over the Gulf National than the Fleetwood or Molinari.
Even pits vary
The famed European has not changed, yet it does.
But kason and Webb Simpson did little to do the job Sergio Garcia, morning warlords, when Alex Norn was arrested.
Bogy and the first dobles left a long Spaard and Swede gap that they will not find.
On Sunday, no one will help you out of your mine.
Fourballs and hours are happy to watch closely because of close cooperation between the potatoes, the advice they give, the advice they give, and the way the trick can change quickly.
Europe has played well as a group and led to the end, but the journals have shown that the USA still has the power to carry on, by choice, to doubt.
Europe took 10-6 the lead on the last day the Ryder Cup.
Europe will be at the best anchor on the last day, the Ryder Cup after getting out the hours and hours on Saturdays on 10- 6.
Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won twice more than the struggle for Tiger Woods by four points of the Gulf National.
On the European side of Thomas Bjorn, determined to sign the cup they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the failure of America on the back boots, putting a 3-1 sequence.
The U.S. has put too much pressure on the four hours of time, to win two games, but it will not just win the ball.
On the other hand Jim Fryk needs nine points in 12 Sunday games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood was the first European to win a series of notes for himself when Molinari, called him "Molliwood" after a good weekend after a good weekend, four players won four points in their first entries in the history of the Ryder Cup.
By winning Woods and Patrick Reed in the four hours, they then turned on the white Woods and the British Dechambeau of America at 5.5 .4.
Woods, entered two Saturday games, showed great determination but now lost 19 of 29 hours and hours in a row.
Justin Rose, sitting in the morning hours, went back to water Henrik Stenson in four hours at 2.1 to break Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – first and third in the world.
And they are willing to return to power in any way they can, just look at cruelty, and uncleanness.
Jordan Spieth and Justini are three times as good as crossing Americans by three points on Saturday.
They won 2.2.1 by crossing the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four hoursfalls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIloy at 4&3 in the four hours while they cut two holes open.
In history the Ryder Cup is only twice to have a group from four points to isolated games, on the other hand Fryk needs only a rating to protect the cup.
After doing better for two days, or so, the Sunday attack seems to overwhelm them.
North Korea says that ‘ she cannot be armed without her trust.
The foreign minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturdays to continue to promote dishonesty in the United States, and it is impossible for the world to give up nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
R Ri Yong Ho told the world General Assembly that North Korea had made "reunity" in the past year, such as nuclear disarmament and nuclear testing, nuclear disarmament, and the promise not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
He said, "Even so, we don't see a defense from the U.S."
"Unresponsible to the U.S., there will be no hope for protection in the world and under this condition there is no way that we don't arm ourselves first."
While It disagrees with the North Korean survey on Washington's refusal by the "section" of nuclear extinction while North Korea may be rewarded by taking steps, the parliament is convinced that we do not prevent nuclear annihilation as fully as Pyongyangylu did previously.
RR refers to the statement established by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump first met between president U.S. and North Korea’s leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim requested to work at "denocation of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised protection for North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking to bring an end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States ordered Pyongung to give off nuclear weapons first.
Washington has always refused to release North Korea.
"U.S. insists on "U.S. nuclear annihilation" and raises the levels of law-pression levels to achieve its objective by force, and to reject the "profane call to end war" says R.
"To understand that the law can humble us like a dream of people who don't care about us.
But the problem is that continuing to do so only aggravates our feelings of insecurity.
RR did not point out the plans for a reuniting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader displayed in the United Nations from the kitchen.
The minister mentioned at least three meetings between Kim and the South Korea Moon Jae-in and the leader of South Korea Jae-in five months ago and added: "If part of the case of the nuclear extermination is in South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of the nuclear genocide will not result in this commitment.
Even so it is said that the sound of RI was quite different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly of the U.S. top and North Korea's rockets which took place after "Mr.
This year the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "put out completely" North Korea, Kim's self-elevity and determination to take action armed action, but much remains to be done and the law remains in force until North Korea ends the nuclear era.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for the whole thing, saying "If it takes two, three, or five years – there is no problem."
China and Russia once argued that the U.N. Security Council was for awards and awarded Pyongngng in the steps taken.
Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompio told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: Security Council on Thursday: "The forcedness of the Security Council must be very strong and invincible until we see the end, fully, and the evidence of nuclear annihilation."
The Security Council has agreed to support North Korea in violation of the law since 2006 in establishing a new nuclear state and Pyong scan system.
Pompeo met Rima with the U.N. General Assembly and said that after all we would visit again Pyongng in the month to prepare for the second.
Pompio has been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his final trip was not well.
She left Pyongngung in July which the advance was made, of North Korea only by publicly showing her "just by pressing a criminal."
North Korea arranges an assembly with Moon this month to complete a mission and a nuclear combination when the United States is taking the same "actual action."
She said that Kim told me of the ‘ same measures ’ she wanted to strengthen safety when Trump promised in Singapore and created a general state of cooperation with Washington.
Harvard novice students help get enough sleep
Young Corese at Harvard University this year all who have not completed sleep too much to overcome the habit of pushing with caffeine.
Education institutions have found many students at prestigious universities that they are useless when it comes to basics that they can take care of themselves less frequently.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has developed a instance, the first of this type of U.S.
She was encouraged to start the service after giving a talk about how sleep is difficult for me to read.
At the end of it came a girl to me, and said, "Why am I now told in the middle years of my years?"
He said that no one had told him about lying down – he surprised me,' ordering the Telegram.
Tourse was first released this year, explaining to students the importance of getting sufficient sleep and doing exercise, while improving daily well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and also director of the University's information course, said that the university has decided to die from instance after learning that most students do not sleep during the week.
The length of the study includes a series of each step taken.
The first section is a picture of the school room, where students choose coffees, curtainers, trainers and books on the effects of caffeine and light exercise are helpful for sleeping, as well as how to sleep.
On the other hand, half the participants are told that avoiding sleep increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, paralysis, and cancer.
A compass map, with useful markings, will encourage participants to give thought to their daily routine.
'We know that he will not change the conduct of the students' immediately.
We believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke tobacco, ’ adds Professor Czeisler.
Culture of self-civilization 'so far' is a thing done, saying, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students reduces sleep levels that are a growing problem.
To ensure that you are getting sufficient sleep, sufficiently, it must be a ‘ secret weapon ’ for a student to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, which means an increased tendency to avoid weight, as insomnia focuses on the state of hunger, causing them to starve.
Raymond Shuthi, a 19 - year - old student in California who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design a lesson, which he studied in one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
She said that the study opened her eyes and encouraged her to miss the study so that she could be at the center.
The next step, he hoped, was to invite the high - school students to learn in the same way as this study program before joining the best - competitive center.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should think of taking the alarm when they go to sleep, as well as that they will wake up, and understand the bad effect of ‘ blue light' produced by the electric light and the LED light, which can produce it from a rotational rhythm, leading to a greater degree.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga point down Gerrard’s men
The Rangers were organized by a fireman and left while at the hands of Dolly Menga who had attacked the joint offense of Steven Greard and then collapsed and failed 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrex has even intended to record their first victory since winning on February 41 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team of Gerrard’s second victory in 18 games as the manager who left his last trial on eight points to the leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership Heads.
Try to attack in seven minutes in front of the half-time, while the Rangers' players endure unsparingly.
When Rangers now descend on the sixth point, Livingston climbs into a third place and behind the Hibernian that differs from one another.
And there may be a problem on the Ranges after the line Calum Spence is caught with the first aid after a long-damage accident caused by something thrown away.
Gerrard made eight changes to the previous Ayr side to the Betfred Cup for fins.
Holt, on the other hand, accompanied the same Livi 11 that took off a point in the Hearts last week and would rejoice at the way your clothing was well dressed that his hands were flung from the air on all sides.
The Rangers may have held the ball too tightly, but Livingston has done much with the ball he has found.
They would have grown up in two minutes after Menga’s sleeping sent Scott Pittman to the article of Allan McGregor but the umpire lost a lot of chance over the pole.
Keaghan Jacobs' freeboard has received Craig Halkettoyi-skipper but her mate's brother-in-law Lithgow has far behind.
The Rangers have been able to control but have been more confident in their play in the third final stage of the game.
Alfonso Morelos has felt that he should have earned our own free will when against Steve Lawlesses but cheered up Steven Thomson's application for the Colombian.
Rangers can put two points in the first half directly in front of the ladder, but the older Ibrex bar Liam Kelly is not worried about the skull worn by Lassana Colibaly and the humiliating attack by Ovie Ejaria.
When Livi opened less than a quarter of 34 times that may not have been due to the game, no one would deny that it was appropriate according to their performance.
The Rangers also failed to resist Jacobs ’ favorite football.
Scott Arfield did nothing to the time Declan Gallagher slapped Scott Robinson, who had done so easily for Menga to finish it.
Gerrdube is a move after vacation when he switched Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and this change almost soon became an immediate reaction when the jackpot jumped to Morelos but Kelly, who is fascinated, runs out of his line to stop.
But Livingston goes on to describe the spectators who play their favorite game, as well as Lithlow and Halket sort long balls after the others.
Holt's side could open the gap of leadership in the final stages, but McGregor stood up and forbade Jacobbs before Lithgow hit a ball on the corner.
Rangers, Glenn Middleton’s successor, learns how long he has had a pin in the dispute with Jacobs but Thomson has also looked aside.
Almanac: Geiger Counter
And And now our page is the "San Sunday morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, some 136 years ago, and BURA... the day that Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a system for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a design that led to the development of a model of the Geiger County.
The scientific spine since then, the Geiger Counter became the spinal back of the paps, as in the 1950 ’ s "Balls of Coronado" in which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
He: ‘ What could that be? ’
Rogers: "Geiger County, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you install open earphones, you can detect radioactivity by media.
Evans: "Tell me, they're out now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before he held 63 years.
But these inventions bear his name forever.
A new goal of cancer can teach the immune system ‘ to see ’ the wrong cells
A new goal of cancer can teach the immune system ‘ to see ’ the wrong cells and kill them
The goal teaches the immune system ‘ to see' the wrong cells as the treatment program
The process involves taking the patient’s immune cells, which are replaced by the laboratory
'Do not see' normal protein in most cancers and then resuscitation
The goal of color is to show promising results to patients with types of cancer.
A woman treated for the purpose, who teaches the immune system to identify the wrong cells, saw a cervical cancer vanish within 18 months.
This procedure involves taking protective cells from the patient, being converted to borrethri to "see" normal protein in a multi-cancerous form called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Bertofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a promising goal."
HER2 "profans the growth of types of cancer," including breast, uterus, lung, and other cancers, explains Prof Bergofsky.
The same way to take protective cells from patients and teach them" is to understand how you understand the cancer cells that have done well in treating some form of leukemia.
Even West was in the mind of establishing Trump, in the helmet of AGA, after his appearance in the suit of a cell.
Bad move
Right away West was praised in the Saturday Light Live after singing in praise of American President Donald Trump and saying he would be in favor of the choice in 2020.
After singing his third night song, named Short Town, when he wore a cap written by Make America Great, he was then causing the sound of the Democrats and made sure to establish Trump.
"I often talk to the white man and say, 'How can you love Trump, you are prejudiced?'
If I were concerned about prejudice, I would have left America long ago," he said.
English began to run on the Matt Damon chapter when a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanough’s testimony before the General thinke Justice Committee for cases of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite this distribution, this West sound stage was set up in chat rooms by broadcaster Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock was trying to discredit West in writing.
Also, West complains to the audience that they have been treated badly at the back of the station and that I can put it on my head.
"They knocked me back on the platform.
They said, ‘ Don't go there with that hat.'
They beat me!
And they say I am abafts," he said, according to the Washington Investigator.
West continued: "Do you want to see a place in the woods?" meaning "He can wear his superman tape, because it means you can't tell him what to do. You want the world to go on?
Try love.
Not long ago, he was twice struck by the private eyes and the SNL team's shy record, the Variety reported, the only one told the printers: "There was a silence of filming."
West was fitted with the title of the singer Ariana Grande in time, her old boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West ordered many by singing the song I Love is, played as a Perrier Bottle.
West is threatened by the head of the old group of TPSA, Candace Turner, who put it on the Tutter, and said: "A strange spirit: ABUSE AND ABORN AND ABORNY."
But the conversationer, Karen Hunter, wrote in the Tutter, said that West "she stole the person he is not sitting and just that's good."
"But I choose not to please anyone (by buying his music or his dress or setting up his "art") that I believe is built up and filled with a dangerous sense in society.
You are free.
So it is," he adds.
Before the presentation, the Rapper had switched to Twitter to change his name, saying that he would now be called "Nane West."
He is not the first singer to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
A Rapper mate, Sneop Dogg, once named Sneop Lion, and indeed the dead musician Prince, changed his name with a sign and was named Prince.

Kit Harington’s famous Game of Thorns denouncing unhealthy masculine customs
Kit Harington knows more about his play with the sword called Jon Snow in the ancient violent - built HBO Game of Thrones.
But this model, 31, has criticized the popular custom of a hero, saying such places on the screen that young boys must be firm for their dignity.
Addressing The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that she believed there was a positive side and asked how to deal with the bad man culture at the time of #NI.
Kit, a recently married sister in the Game of Threes, also 31, admits that she is also ‘ committed ’ to coping with the problem.
I feel myself, and very deeply touched, not now; but life, and we have gone astray from this masculinity?
'What were we teaching men when they were growing up, according to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that a telescope will have little influence on the development of a bad custom of masculinity because of his trained fans
He continued: ‘ What natural lessons have you been taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, makes young boys confident of the Case of Manhood?
Do I think that’s the biggest problem at this time we’d change Kanjan?
Because there is something clearly wrong with young men.'
In conversation you have also agreed that he cannot make prequels or squarers in the Game of Threes when the game goes towards the end of the summer, saying he is finished with the horsefighting fields.
From November Kit will play on Sam Shepard’s True West in the story of moviemakers and his brother, who is a burglar.
The critic recently mentioned that he imagined that his wife Rose would be an outstanding achievement at the Drama of thrones.
"I met my wife in the sport, and therefore gave me the next family, and my health is now," he says.
Rose played Ygrette, Kit Characer Jon Snow's Love, in the Emmy fotarties prize.
The couples married in February 2018 in Leslie’s home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reporting 14% forward to new circumstances
China announces an increase of 14% of the population that lives with AIDS and is due to an outbreak of AIDS.
More than 82,000 people were affected in the country, health officials say.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases came about.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, resistant to changes from the past.
But the number of people receiving an ambulance in this way has reduced to almost zero, so said Chinese health officials at the Yunnan district convention.
Yearly, however, the number of people living with skin rash and pre-smokers has risen to 100,000.
Integration is now a minor problem in the LGBT Community.
The guilt of flirting and homosexuality in China was removed in 1997, but prejudice against homosexuals is rampant.
Because of the life - style, studies have shown that 70% of men and men have ended up having sex with women.
Much of the infection results from the unintended prevention of sexual relations in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to bring the world into crisis as efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that some work has violated the GOP data of manators', explosioning 's dangerous false ‘ or 'pockets'
The Rep. Maxine Waters has published the suspicion that one of his employees has installed three secondarys in the Republican in the U.S.
The Los Angeles Democrats have explained that the charges have been spread by the champion-ultra-right line and the Internet.
"A lie, a lie, and many other gross lies," says Waters in Twitter statements.
The missing item includes home addresses and numbers from the U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both in Utah.
Information comes from the Internet on Thursday, installed in Capitol Hill while listening to the Senate system on sexual misconduct of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanough.
This jump occurs after Kavanough has been subjected to three secondary questions.
Ancient websites such as Gateway Pinit and Red State reported that IP addresses indicate that the Waters Office is related to it and that it has produced the name of the Waters work, reports Hill.
"These unprovable charges are false and are not true," continues Waters.
"The goodness of my workers – the property, the property of the person, and the safety of the vulnerable as a result of fraud and false accusations – has not been involved with scratching the matter.
These base charges are absolutely false and are not true.
Waters ’ statements are immediately critical to the Internet, including the former White House press secretary Arischer.
"The spill can be exhausted," wrote Fleischer.
"This means that he is not mild of the Members of Congress.
If someone is criticized for something they did not do, they should not give up.
They should not be too difficult.
They are not to blame for the accused’s actions.
They must be cool and peaceful.
Fleischer seems to liken Waters' answer to criticism by Democrat Judge Kavanough, who was criticized by critics who were particularly tired of the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican successor who will enter Waters's shoes at the time option, breathe with him through his mind to Twitter.
"Very large if true," wrote to Twitter.
In his commission, Waters said his office to inform the "Legal officers and the legislature of the law on these fraud charges.
"We will make sure that the guilty are exposed," he continues, "and they will be charged for all their acts of vandalism and danger to any or all of my personnel.
View of the Johnny English Strikes Against – lowering the power of Rowan Atkinson’s spy poof
It is now customary to consider Brexit's importance on any end of a British film and is not seen to accompany the resurrection of this Johnny English game – which began long ago with the Johnny English and was returned in 2011 by the Johnny English Reborn.
Eating hot potatoes, as mentioned in the article, can we have a new opportunity to sell?
At any rate, an open eye, the face of the Johnny English band that had the right to promote new things the second time – that name is a big joke designed for English - speaking theaters.
You are indeed an inexperienced explorer’s watcher that goes beyond even his unusual pretense to the glory of Clousau, the Sir Bean's, and his strength from the Chariots of Fire in the opening of the London 2012 Olympics.
And it comes from a traveler and the mysterious man Atkinson who passes through the current ads and is now corrupt on Barclay’s TV, who has left confusion in his wake.
There are some and two occasions for this present visit to JE.
I like Johnny English who climbs a helicopter while he has broken an old military suit and small swords hanging on his helmet.
Atkinson's comic gift is a display, but the humor looks like very low and extreme, especially in the production of the "deep" films, such as 007 and the Mission Amossyable itself now present the comics as a substance.
To us the laughters of our children are more than adults, and to me the Johnny English’s journey is less straightforward and unobservable and is less focused on a sound film by the noise and personality of Bean.
The story now on the horizon is that Great Britain is in a very large area.
The Cyber-hacker entered the British observatory, producing the details of British jets in the field, which is of concern to the engines laid on the job – it is a small task for Kevin Eldon.
The last minute in a prime minister that carries himself and in short, faced the failure of the political community: Emma Thompson is trying to imitate Teresa-May but there is nothing in the text he can say about it.
His bodyguards informed him that all the spies had to find one who was still en route.
This means that Johnny English himself, now as a soolmaster in an expensive place, but gives an unwritten lesson for the spy: this is a joke, as England presents the study of exploration at the Rock-type Academy.
The En-Swing was transferred to Whitehall to be given emergency instructions and joined by the brother-in-law Bough, also by Ben Miller.
Bough is still a married man, combined with the submarine teller, a pleasant place for Vicki Pepperine to play with.
So Batman and Robin are really lying in the Secret Service of the Back, which meets Olga Karylenko's being autifulity industry Ophelia Bullefa.
There, the prime minister quickly sinks into the millions ’ culture that he can solve computer problems: the sunister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
England and Bough began their strange journey: hiding as a waiter, starting a fire in a French restaurant; they started a problem selling themselves into a special Volta boat; and England, which removed the mystery when she learned to use the Personal Real Control Heat to test the Volt's house.
All efforts are made to improve the last session or to be more friendly and emotionally active, than the TV of children in general.
They have been firmly established.
And like some of Johnny English films I couldn’t control it: Britain’s film industry could not provide a picture of his talent?
Labour denies that they invented the plan to work four days but pay five days
The Jeremy Corbyn team of Labors think of a wonderful plan that Britons will see for four victims – but paid five.
The team reported that they require company management to pass on the profit derived from the Articial Intelligence (AI) to the staff by granting them an extra date.
The workers seem to enjoy three days of the week – but pay the same amount.
The sources say that this view would fit the economic purpose of the group and the programme to convert the nation to the workers.
Change in four days is approved by the Trade Union Congress as a means of taking the opportunity to change the economy.
The source of the Older Labor Party tells The Sunday Times: ‘ A police survey is expected to be done before the end of the year.
'Not at night but four days in the church, but working four days is said to be by the means of a remuneration for the crew and the overall sense of the field.'
The Labour Party will not be the first to recommend a plan, with the Green Party binding on four working days during the 2017 calendar function.
The whole Labour Party has not yet been set up, though.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'Work for four days is not an organization police force and is never thought of by the group.'
Shaw Chancellor John McDonnell used the previous Labour church conference to express his view of the socialism revolution in the economy.
Mz McDonell said she was willing to lose weight and the power returned to ‘ the unknown guides' and 'wors' in the firms.
The scheme also the chancillor also explains that sharreholders in water companies may not get the whole suitor as the Lavour government are doing ‘ drawing' in the wrong ways.
He also made sure to install the staff on company boards and the Inclusive Onership Funds to give 10 percent of the per cent of prime-stortor fire fireworks to the staff, which will build an annual income limit to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said "60 Minutes" that FBI research on Kavanough could change their minds.
Investigation on FBI charges by judge Brett Kavansaugh reduced election time to the Supreme Court last week, and raised questions that the findings of detectives can change the way the commissioners of Republican influence the followers.
In an interview written on Sunday, "60 Minutes" in the interview Scott Pelley asked the Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI should find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more comfortable than her South Carolina peers.
"I'll say, yes," says Kennedy.
"I went to the side, and also I spoke to the judge Kavanough.
I called after this, and the charges went out, saying, 'Have you done this?'
She has been stubborn, persistent and decisive.
Graham’s net, however, seems to have been set.
"My mind has decided on Brett Kavanough and it will take hard criticism," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what to do, but I know this: Brett immediately refused," adds Graham, explaining about Christine Blasey Ford.
And all that counted didn't prove this.
It has been 36 years.
I see nothing changing.
What has the Global Catizen Festival and Have They Try to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will deal with the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event with a list of players who will play with the same goals; to rid the world of poverty.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will have hordes of people entering a large park in Central Park not only pleasing Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also sleeping with the real intention of ending poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is a conglomerate of the Global Poverty Project, a world group that strives to eradicate poverty by increasing people who fight for it.
To get a party ticket (except that you would like to pay for VIP tickets), special ticketers had to do something like the "optional", send an e-mail to the world leader, call or do some other thorough thing to help you relax on the loss of poverty.
How successful has the Global Citizen been in the 12 years that remain to reach its goal?
Is the idea of getting people on a free concert the right way to try people to do something, or of what has been termed "cricktivism" – people who feel like they are making a difference by signing a list on a computer or sending it to a machine?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has recorded the "acts" of more than 19 million followers, overlooking different motives.
It says that this action has helped to alert the world’s pilots to ease their concentrations and goals at over $37 Billion to affect the health of 2.25 Billion people in 2030.
In 2018 you start, the team has picked up 390 opinions and expressions since their actions, about $10 a dollar removed or tried to collect.
The team estimates that the income has directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Another commitment involves The Power of Nutrition, U.K. formaters and inventors devoted to "help children properly," promises to provide Rwanda $335 million to help eradicate hunger in the country after getting 4,700 tons from the Global Citizens.
"By the establishment of the UK government, the donors, the national governments, and the Global Citizens like you, we can try to make history a lack of nutrition due to the lack of public repair," The Power of Nutrition operation operation Trade Ullman has seen a widespread presence at a concert in London in April 2018.
The team also said that it had been more than 5,000 years to call the U.K. to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the support of the project, the Power of Nutrition, to reach 5 million women and children on a healthy diet.
In answer to some FAQs on their website, what do you think we can do to eliminate extreme poverty?
The Global Citizen replied: ‘ It will be a long and difficult way – sometimes it will fall and fail.
However, as public rights and anti-partheid demonstrations before us, we will win, for we are very strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, who take them to this year in New York, to be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
S would be able to use the Navy to prevent the export of Russian electronics - Internal Security.
Washington "if necessary" can use the Navy to stop the Russian electronic markets, including the Middle East, the International Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, under the direction of the Washington Examiner.
All said that Russian and Syria - clear dialogues, when working with official declarations – is a way to try new electronic markets.
"I believe in the reason that in the Middle East they want to find egenergy as in Eastern Europe, and in Central Europe, reports.
Also, according to the worker, there are ways to repair it.
"The United States is able, by means of our army, to ensure that the seaways are opened and, if necessary, be closed, to ensure that their power does not go to the market," he says.
Zinke has been talking to those present at the Consumer Energy Organisation, a non-profit group that calls itself the ‘ voice of power operator' in the U.S.
He also compared Washington's attempts to deal with Russia and Iran, saying that the results are the same.
"Selecting a trade with Iran and Russia, to some extent, is a means of gaining and getting oil," he says, while referring to Russia as "a horse of intrigue" and having a economy trusting in oil fossils.
These statements appear as Trump’s office attempts to promote the export of their natural gas into Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest route for European consumers.
As a result, officials of the Trump office, including the U.S. president Donald Trump himself, are trying to encourage Germany to quit the New Stream branch project "notable", according to Trump, which made the Berlin "under" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nrd Stream 2 pipes are $111 billion, designed to double the number of existing pipes to be 70 feet [110 m] high, are indeed an economic project.
The Kremlin says that Washington's opposition to the project is invariably due to economic causes and is an example of unjust competition.
"I believe that we have the same view that power cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to decide from whom to buy," says Russian Minister Aeksandr Nova after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Power Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stand has caused Germany to fall back, which has renewed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organization of Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told the US to withdraw from the EU operation and contract between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third world interrupts our flight," says Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the recent conference between the German Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren's Investigative Decision for Presidentship in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
The General of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday to "result" the choice of being president after mid-time choice.
During a convention at the town hall in Hotele, Massachusetts, Warren has made sure that he will consider the choice.
"It is time for the women to go to Washington and set up our corrupt government that includes the woman who will be the leader," he says, in accordance with The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take a closer look at the choice of being president."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during a city hall conference, saying "you have been talking to people who are misleading them.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump did to my people," he said.
Warren spoke freely against Trump and the choice of the High Court, Brett Kavanough.
In her letter to Tweetter on Friday, Warren said that "certainly we need a FBI investigation before voting."
The report published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's followers do not think they should enter the choice in 2020.
50 percent of the Massachusetts people say that the Senator should not enter the option, in accordance with statistics obtained by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent have supported it to be suitable.
Statistics have shown some support for being former Emperor Deval Patrick as suitable for the election, 38 percent as being unsuitable, and 48 percent as unsuitable.
Other names discussed by the Democratics of the higher professors who may have entered the 2020th election include former President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said that you will decide legally on January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Xin speaks of Track Panin at the Donald Trump gathering
Track Pin, 26 years old, has spent a whole year in Iraq after being drafted into the war with Sept.
He was arrested and charged with violence at home on Monday night
"When my son faces, what he went through after, I can see how other families are coping with the painful effects of PTSD and other injuries our soldiers brought with them," he told the audience at the Dalld Trump conference in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of his son and other warriors, "they are also different persons, and are strengthened, and wonder whether there is any respect for what they are like by what the soldiers and the soldiers are in the air, and all the other soldiers, that they have done for their country."
She was arrested on Monday in Yasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence by beating a woman, disrupting the domestic violence and drinking time, in accordance with Dan Bennett, the spokesman of the Wallilla Police Department.
18 stations, D.C. supports the work of a new security objective.
The 18 states and the District of Columbia support a new legal attempt to have a new U.S. policy that prohibits protection from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and district have sent a commission to witnesses in Washington to support the person in need of protection against this goal, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. emotions that the American Civil Liberties Union has installed in August against the state goal has not yet been revealed.
He said that "he and his sons, violent gang members," subjected him to torture, but the U.S. officials accepted his request for protection on July 20.
She has been settled in Texas.
States advocates of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produces a large number of people who have requests for protection from the U.S., as nations who are facing serious problems with criminals and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy of protection reversed the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed uncovered immigrants to escape domestic violence to gain protection.
The Attorney General of Columbia State, Karl Racine said in his speech on Friday the new policy "not heeding decades of royal, international legislation."
"The law says that all requests for protection must be judged by the facts of each request, and making a decision like this is a violation of that law," says the court-called witness.
The attorneys also pointed out that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering is destroying the U.S. economy, saying they may become businessmen and ‘ create employment opportunities for themselves.'
The Attorney General advised immigration judges to no longer protect people from domestic violence and gang violence with June.
"People can be protected if they leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or being a member of a certain party or political opinion," says the Sessions in his proclamation on June 11.
Protection was not intended to solve all the problems -- even all the major problems that people face daily throughout the world.
Great efforts are being made in Palu as the death toll rises repeatedly in efforts to find survivors.
For those who survive, the situation is precarious.
"It's a real challenge," says 35-year-old Risa Kusumu, comforting her son in a center for those who have survived the city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
We don't have clean water.
The inhabitants seem to return to their battered homes, to collect their goods in a great quantity of water, trying to find whatever they can.
Hundreds of people were also injured in hospitals, destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5, were full of deaths.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken the spine and shoulder, were sitting outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside because of an ongoing earthquake.
Tears welled up in her eyes as she relived that touching moment in the room of the fifth - floor apartment where her wife and daughter lived.
"There was no time to look for a way to escape.
I was depressed over broken walls, I think to myself," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city of marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and it was a relief again.
I don't know what has happened to her and to my child.
I hope they are alive.
The U.S. ambassador accuses China' for threatening 'false ads'
After a week the Chinese official newspaper had a four-page advertisement for U.S. goods for both U.S. and China, a U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using an American newspaper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke of the Chinese - sponsored assets in Des Moines Register - an Iowa newspaper - after suing China for entry into the election case of Nov. 6 in the U.S., which China disagrees.
The Trump charge that Beijing was trying to fit into the U.S. election created what U.S. officials said to Reuters is a new stage in the Washington press.
Although foreign governments are often to advertise for commercial purposes, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in a growing trade war that creates an endless corvée.
The money that China wanted in the early part of the trade war was intended to torture messengers in such places as Iowa support the Trump Republic, said Chinese and U.S.
Terry Brandon, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who sends many agricultural goods to China, revealed that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, writes Brandon in the Sunday article Des Moines Register, "t double this harassment by making false ads in our free newspaper."
"In the province which has been published, the Chinese government has made itself discovered in the popular American custom of free speech and free press by presenting a fee-to-Des Moines Register," writes Brandon.
"In contrast, at the Beijing street market, there are few exceptions to you, and you will not see the real reaction of the various Chinese attitudes that may have to do with the effects of China's economic crisis, if it is thought by the media to be viewed by China’s Communist Party," he writes.
He has added that "one of China's leading newspapers has escaped the chance to print" his story, although he never said which newspaper.
Republicans Expenditure Women Before Medieval Choice and Age because of Kavanough’s Failure, warns Critics
As many of the high Republicans are waiting and protecting the possibility of being brought to the High Court by Brett Kavanough on a number of charges of abuse, analysts warn that the fire would return with the promoter, especially with the primers, during the medieval and future period.
The lungs are high in this respect, and many Republicans have already indicated that they wanted to continue with the election.
Those things will no longer be postponed," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School tells The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher doubted that the last attempts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arina) to investigate will suffice to cause angry votes to lower the lungs.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a red counselor and international attorney for the developing class of Moveon on Friday, according to a Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the prosecutors announced that "Come on November!!" as they were rioting at the Senate hall as the Republicans manage the Judicial Committee prefer to continue and select Kavanough despite the evidence prescribed by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports the Mic.
"Democratism and motivation will almost disappear," says Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst, informing the press.
"People say it's already hot. That's true."
But it can still be higher, especially among women's electors in cities and young votes, 18-9 years old, who, while not dear to the president, seldom vote.
Even before Ford’s evidence, which contains details of his alleged abuse charges against the chance of being brought to the High Court, analysts say that the target can be returned with a rival if the Republicans continue to prove it.
"This is now the GOP damage," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the previous week, according to NBC News.
"It's just about a committee vote or a last vote or that Kavanough is placed on a bench, concerning how the Republicans handled this and how they treated him," says Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a public - help team to choose Democrats, informing the media station.
The Americans, however, seem to be divided on whom they believe in the evidence of Ford and Kavanough, and are inclined to turn off the Kavanoughs.
New statistics from You Gov show that 41 percent of the people actually or to some extent believe in Ford evidence, while 35 percent say that they are sure or to some degree believe the case of Kavanough.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanough was definitely or to some extent lying to the evidence he gave, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI currently investigates the complaints brought by Ford and at least one defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford spoke before the Senate Financial Committee the previous week, vowing that Kavanough abused her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the defendant in the Supreme Court showed her private parts and showed her while at the party during your study period in Yale in the 1980s.
Author of World Wide Web Program to Start a New Contact With Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, starts a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
A new technology project, Inrupt, is a company built from the open platform of the Berners-Le Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their device will be stored and the information people are allowed to reach.
In a unique conversation with the Fast Company, Bernards-Lee joked that the Inrupt's aim is "to dominate the world."
"We must do it now," says this work.
‘ It is a historic one.'
This app uses Solid technology to allow people to create a "Personal online data" or PED.
It can include a list of people, what to do, a calendar, a music library, and some other electronic and human devices.
Like the Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify are all found in one slip and at the same time.
Notable for the PED store is that it depends on the user who can obtain the type of information.
The company calls it "the net which gives you power."
The idea of the Inrupt, in accordance with the CEO of the company John Bruce, is that the company has brought only rubies, prossi and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
This company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM security platform, non-creasing staff with a contract for the project, and a number of volunteer card manufacturers.
Starting this week, the inventors of technology worldwide may develop their apps using the tools available from the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his group speak both "Facbook and Google as to whether or not they should be brought up with a complete change in which all their business is going to change completely.
"We don't ask their permission.
In one post in a printed Media, Berners-Lee writes that Inrupt "will provide the power for trade and operating systems that will help protect the integrity and the new web package built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has taken the lead in the discussion of neutrality.
Even when Extract is released, Bernards-Lee will always be the founder and Director of the World Wide Network Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am looking forward to the beginning of the coming age of the web," adding Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commended by a clergyman who received the WW1 Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to win Victoria Cross during World War I has been celebrated in his city after 100 years.
Captain Bernard Vann received a prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellingise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later and did not realize that he had won the greatest prize in the British army.
A monument has been opened to her two grandchildren when there is a clock at Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, has been a "good sign" that the stone was opened in the year 100 directly from his grandfather's prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a fog which was blowing on the floor of explosives and guns and guns."
Later she ran to the firing point and “with great courage ” led ahead before running with a gun and killed three soldiers.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German gunman on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, aged 72, says that his grandfather's actions are "something I don't know I can't do but something I respect."
He and his brother Dr James Vann put flowers in the back of the clock, led by the Brentop Imperial Youth Bank.
Michael Vann said that "you feel privileged to have a part in the clock" and said that "the real military might is shown by the support that most people will give."
MMA followers spent the whole night watching Bellator 206, but they got Pappa Pig
Imagine spending a whole night watching Bellator 206 and being forbidden to watch the event.
The San Jose festival had 13 games, including 6 on the main card and displayed all night in the UK on Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to fight, the UK onlookers were left surprised when the station changed to Peppa Pig.
Some would not be happy after a long night of waiting, especially at dawn, for the event to take place.
One successor in Twitter described this change of child animation as a "unexpected laugh."
"It is a government policy that by 6 a.m. the competition was not appropriate and therefore had to be transferred to a child program," says Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator for marketing and communications, when asked about this change of program.
"Pepepa the pig," yes."
The president of the Bellator company Scott Coker said they would look after their hoops to unite the UK viewers in the future.
"I think if I think to play it again, I think we can try it," says Corker.
"But it is six o'clock on Sunday there, and we will not be able to correct this until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
But we are on top of it.
I tell you, at the time of the change, there were so many messages sent to them that they were not all pleasant.
To try to correct it, we thought it was a technological problem.
But it was not, it was a matter of government.
I promise that it will never happen again.
We will keep five events to a minimum — as we often do and try to please our followers and have gone to extremes.
It's not what it's most desirable.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘ rejected ’ because of his sex
The Olympic athlete Tom Daley claims to have grown up isolated because of his sex - but that has given him the incentive to succeed.
This 24-year-old gambler said he didn't realize it until he went to high school that "not everyone likes me."
Regarding the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs, published by Lauren Laverne, he spoke of homosexual rights to give others "hope."
He also said that if a parent prevented him from winning the Olympics, he would not think so.
The normal radiocaster of the available program, Kirsten Young, has been inactive for months because she is sick.
From a person rejected from the first Laverne program, Stanley said that he felt ‘ rejected ’ by everyone as he grew up because it was not acceptable for boys and girls.
He said: ‘ To this day, those feelings of worthlessness, feeling different, are the real feelings that have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ’
She wanted to show that she also was a "human," he said, so that she would not disappoint everyone when it finally came to being identified as a homosexual.
The winner who twice won the Olympic championship is a high professor who has pointed out the LGBT and used his position at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge other countries not to consider it wrong to practice homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt so fortunate that he could live a simple life without having to cope with problems and want to give the "hope" to others.
This winner who won three world championships claimed to date a man - a U.S. film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "an unexpected moment."
Staley married an Oscar, who left her 20 years ago but who said that the passing of years has never been a problem.
"When you face a lot of life at such a young age" - you go to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died from cancer three years later — he found it difficult to find an equal person who had the same experience.
The two gave birth to a child by June, a son whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Stanley has said that his "view" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was concerning 'I want to win the gold medal,' he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the gold rings of the Olympic.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
Her son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Stanley says that his father did not accept his death and that one of the last things he had asked whether they still had tickets to London 2012 — as he wanted to be there.
"I couldn't say 'I won't be able to attend those games', he said.
"I would hold him in my hand while he breathed the last, and until he breathed his last and died, when I saw that he also was a man as we were," he said.
The following year Dale entered the2012 Olympics and won a copper medal.
"I could see that this was what I had been looking for all my life — swimming before my people in the Olympic Games, there was nothing better than this," he said.
It also gave him the choice of his favorite song — Heather Small - has always been nervous during the Olympic preparation and still excited.
The Desert Island Discs is in BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is sitting on a bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Pil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday when playing his 47th Pass game, but he will have to climb socks so as not to be a sad history.
Mickelson, who will be playing on this very event for two 12 years, is sitting on a bench by captain Jim Fryk on Saturday’s fourfolds and four-hours.
Instead of taking the lead, as he often does in playing in the United States, this fifth winner divided the day into two players and worked in the game in hopes of finding out what is causing him to stumble.
Not a good person who plays well even after a very short period of time in this game, this 48 - year - old player, whose dead dead body of the Le Golf National, is often a problem when playing a distant ball.
And if the playing area is not so much a problem, Mickelson, who will be playing the ninth play Sunday, will meet Francesco Molinari, an expert in the British Ocean, who was playing with the red Tommy Fleewood to win all four of their games this week.
If these Americans, who have lost 4 points in 12 games of a single player, start a game well, Mickelson's game can be a complete cut.
Fulyk has expressed hope for another, and he has said nothing more.
‘ Fully aware of his present role, he grabbed me on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,' says Fulyk.
"You are very confident of yourself.
He is a famous athlete, and he has much to do in the past, including this holiday.
I probably never imagined her playing two games.
I expected more, but that is what has happened and what we thought we should do.
You want to play, like everyone else.
Mickelson will go back to record the number of games he has played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It may be his last game in the Ryder Cup that has never match his accomplishments as a player.
Muckelson has won 18 times, he has been eaten 20 times and has played the same in size, although Fulyk says that his presence has improved the group.
"It's nice to be with her, to have fun, to laugh, to have fun with people, and to have her in the gang room," you have explained.
"I think young players have enjoyed being with him, and, on this weekend, it has been good to see you.
He has much more to do than to play."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leading by many points does not matter
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows that taking the lead with many points when it comes to the last day of the Ryder Cup flight can easily change into a hard game.
Dane played for the first time in the 1997 drama in Valderma, when a team with a captain named Seva Ballesteros led five points over the Americans but finally took the lead in one point, winning on 141–2-131 purpose.
"You always remind yourself that we were taking the lead with many points in Valokline, where we were eaten, and in Valderra, where we won, but for a few points," says Bjorn, in the picture, after viewing the 2015 Kilas for 5-3 with both Friday and Saturdays to take the lead at Le Golf National.
So history will tell me and everyone in the group that you are not finished.
Do what you can tomorrow.
Get it out of your system, and do all you can in the right direction.
It is not until you have found the facts.
We have the goal, and it is an effort to take this cup, and that is what we focus on.
I've said this, I've been focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we know what's true about that number of the world's biggest players."
Thrilled with the way his players play in a game field, Bjorn has added: ‘ I will never reach my conclusions about this.
Tomorrow’s game is different.
The next day it will decide how each player will play, and that is different.
It is good to go out and play with the person when things go well, but if you play alone, that is where you are thoroughly tested as a golf player.
That is the message you have to pass on to the athletes, that you do all you can to tomorrow.
Now, he leaves his partner behind and must go and do all he can.
Unlike Bjorn, his rival Jim Furryk will be seeing that his players are playing better by themselves than what has happened in a game, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, to find three points in four.
Fulyk himself is able both to eat and to win on the last day of the last minute, as he was once part of a Brookline victory party before being eaten when Europe was "punished by miracles in Medinah."
"I well remember," he says always in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain of 1999, encouraged his players on the final day of the game.
"We have 12 important games in the morning, but it may be good to start with the upper gear as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When that incentive and enthusiasm persist, he places great pressure on the central sports team.
We organized our players accordingly and put our players in the way we think, it will enable us to perform magic tomorrow.
Thomas is assigned to try to take the lead in fighting and returning from the sport and facing Rory McIlroy at the top sport, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poutter and other Europeans in the upper class.
"I go along with this group because I think they will be ready for the whole game," says Bjorn of the selected players.
The German warship has been launched again
A new version of German Navy designer named frigate was to begin operating in 2014 to replace the old Cor-era ships, but it will not be there until at least next year because of the system and snowball cost, reports the local news media.
The commission of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the captain of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, is now postponed in the first half of 1920, says Die Zeit the newspaper quoting military spokesmen.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that followed the malaria crisis threatened the future of a willing project.
The four ships of Baden-Wurttemberg-clas alone by the Navy as early as 2007 are to replace the Bremen-class ships.
Understandably, ships will have powerful guns, types of antiaircraft guns, and hidden technology, such as space missing, inflammable, and noise.
Other important items included long periods of care, it is impossible to use new vessels until two years later at the ship’s destination.
However, further confusion means that the important development of warships - will give Germany foreign power - it will be out of hand when it goes into operation, says Die Zeit.
A vessel with a long, long - dead F125 appeared on paper last year, when Germany Navy refused to use the ship and returned it to Blohnase-Voss to the port of Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to which it was made after being brought.
Little is known about the reasons for the ship's voyage, but the German press said that there was much important problem in connection with the "softs and hardware" that made the warship useless if sent to war.
The problems of the Society were especially important as the ships Baden-Wuerttemberg-clas will be used by a crew of 120 sailors - part of the old Bremenclas.
It also appeared that the ship is heavier than that required to reduce its effectiveness and reduce the chances that Navy will be able to provide future improvements.
A 7,000th of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have been twice the weight of the same ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides the hangar problems, the cost of the entire project - including training of a crew crew has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an astounding amount of 1.83.1 million ($3.6bn) - from %.22.2 million .2 million.
The problems of new ships are of particular importance as recent warnings that German naval's strength was dropping.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, a German member of Parliament, admitted to Navy that he is well "handling the departure and entry of the ships which can be used."
An officer has said that problems have lasted over a hundred years, since old ships have become obsolete but no other vessels have been working in their place.
He is disappointed that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-clas have been able to join the Navy.
National Trust obeys the hidden life of the bats
A new research done in the Scottish Highlands area has intended to reveal how bats use their habitat when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will provide us with a better understanding of the life - style of these strange flying creatures and will help direct conservation activities in the future.
A study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual singing pipistrelles and Daubenton brown - eared Daubenton bats in Wester Ross.
Special records will be posted in specific locations to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will make small checks using hand-manned fans.
A logical analysis of the expert of all records will show the frequency with which bats call and what certain animals are doing.
The map of his residence and the report will be published to create a detailed model of his life - style.
Rob Dewar, an NTS zookeeper, hopes that the results will reveal which places are most important to bats and how they use them.
This knowledge will help to see the benefits of local control work, such as meadow creation and the best way to preserve the habitats of bats and other related animals.
Scottish bats and all the UK are rare throughout the last century.
They are threatened with construction and construction projects that affect their environment and loss.
Power plants and lights can pose dangers, and so can fly - destruction paper and home - care drugs, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats are not necessarily blind.
Yet, as they hunt at night, their ears are more active than their eyes when hunting an animal.
They use a complex system of sensory hearing to locate animals and objects in their flight.
The NTS, caring for more than 270 historic buildings, the important gardens of 38 and 36,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land around the world, considers bats to be important.
They have ten trained experts, who take regular exams, to check their environment and how to protect them.
This organization even arranged with the Scottish reserve the first and only male bates in Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten Scottish bat species.
The head of the area, David Thompson, says this is the best place to live.
"Here in Threave is the best place for the bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many great trees and other good places.
But there is much about bats that we cannot know, so the work we do here and in other buildings will help us to understand more about what they need in order to survive.
He emphasizes the importance of checking to see if there are any bats before working on a building because destruction of their own habitat may kill as many as 400 female and younger bats, almost killing all residents in the area.
Bats are protected and commanded not to kill, torture, or disturb or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to come to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and most of our species don't know what is going on.
Ronaldo refuses the charges of abuse as lawyers plan to fine a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo spoke of claims that he has lied to you that he said "false stories," that people are "seeking to improve themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers planned to fine the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which has published these charges.
This Portuguese player and Juventures is accused of sexually abusing an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
Reportedly, he has paid $375,000 to cover the case, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on the Instaggram Live video with his 142 million followers after the charges were reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, has published the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, is false stories," says an expert who has been rewarded with Ballon d'Or five times on a camera.
"They tried to make themselves a name by using my name.
It is normal.
They want to make a name for themselves by calling on my name, but it is part of my job.
I’m happy and everything goes well with me," adds the player, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to fine the Der Spiegel for these charges, calling them "an unacceptable report of private life," says Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would want to pay back the money for the "security of his identity" with the amount equal to the magnitude of the case against which he was accused, which is probably the most crucial issue of a recent human rights violation.
The reported event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino room in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the club, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to return to the character's room, where they are said to have abused him, in accordance with the paper posted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the event and told him that he is "a good person" with "99 per cent."
According to authorities, Ronaldo agreed to have sexual relations with each other, but they agreed.
Mayorga too acknowledged that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of those who were injured in the hospital, but she later admitted that the matter was handled outside the court because she felt "for fear of revenge" and was concerned about the“ social shame."
This 34-year-old woman says she wants to change the agreement as she continues to be damaged by what is said to have happened.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid from Manchester United when the charges were reported, and this year he has switched to the great Italian group Juve to the 1781100 million contract.
Brexit: UK will always blame itself for losing car manufacturers
The UK's "always regret" if he loses his position as the leading figure in the world after Brexit's creation of motor vehicles, says former financial Secretary Greg Clark.
He has added that "some concern" is that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement it will temporarily stop its product in the Burnaston industry, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," says Mr Clark.
The Japanese designer said that the result of delays in failure to agree with Brexit could cause job loss.
The Burkinaston industry - making Auris and Avensis of Toyota - has produced about 150,000 vehicles last year and 90% are exported to other European Union.
"What I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March will stop the product in our industry," says Marvin Cooke, the administrator in Toyota in Burkiston.
Some UK car manufacturers have threatened to get out of the EU without the agreement on how trade in other countries will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Oxford Day industry a month after Brexit.
What is mainly concern is related to what car designers call dangerous in case Brexit agreements fail.
The product of Toyota is carried "according to the demand of the time", parts of cars arrive every 37 minutes from both the UK and the EU according to ordered traffic.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances in the border that the industry says can lead to delays and the end of car-building parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to handle more than one - day cars in their business in Derbyshire, says the company, so the product may have to be stopped.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May, the Chequers program for future cooperation with the EU is "refited carefully to avoid that check on the border."
"We need to get a contract. We want to find the best agreement we will permit, as even as we will not only succeed but also take advantage of this opportunity," informing the TODAY’s BBC Radio program.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but also other industries is that we need to be able completely to carry on what has been a successful surgical procedure.
Toyota could not state how long the product will be stopped, but in the long run, it warns that the additions will reduce the productivity of the industry and will eventually be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaryis, who has worked in Burkinaston for 24 years and who has been in connection with the Union’s union industry, says that his members are concerned: "What I have seen when these tasks are finished never again.
A government spokesman says: "We have set up a clear and reliable program for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be delayed again, says White House
The eagerly anticipated meeting of Donald Trump with the lawyer general Rod Rosenstein's turn may be "diverted by another week" as the battle of the higher court and the establishment of Brett Kavanough continues, says the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein directs the special commission of Robert Mueller, which investigates Russian election disorders, links between Trump and Russia and possible legal disturbances from the president.
Whether Trump will expel the lawyer's assistant in general, thus endangering Mueller's freedom, has given Washington news that can be discussed for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had engaged in a pipe to record interviews with Trump and the opportunity for the president to be expelled on the pretense of the 25th.
Rosenstein turned the offer down.
But last Monday you have visited White House, although there are reports that you are about to leave.
Instead, meeting Trump, then of the United Nations in New York, is announced to be on Thursday.
Trump said that he did not "plead" against Rosenstein but the meeting was late to start so as to avoid having to cross a court of justice in which Kavanough and one of the women accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of them were witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a single FBI week investigation of charges against Kavanough, further reducing the full Canate's receipt.
Trump news writer Sarah Sanders, has appeared in the Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "On the day of what he is not yet appointed, it may be this week, I think that it will be postponed by another week, as there are other things going on in the high court.
But I'm going to see it and I like to keep the media know what is going on.
Some news reporters may not agree with this: Sanders never had a conference at the White House since 10 September.
The program director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the decline of these meetings is not due to the fact that the media "they like to talk," although he has said: "I will not deny the fact that they are talking."
He then points out that the links between Trump and the media will be several.
"The president made more question-by-platitudes than any other president prior to him," he said, adding without proving the evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
There will still be meetings, said Sanders, but "if the media get an opportunity to ask the U.S. president directly, that is better than talking to me.
We are trying to do so many times and have seen that we are doing too much in the past few weeks and will take the place of a news conference if you are able to talk to the U.S. president.
Trump usually pays attention to questions when he leaves White House or when he participates in public chat rooms or news conferences with respected visitors.
He rarely asks questions when alone.
New York on this weekend the president likely showed why, by not paying attention and sometimes by speaking recklessly in front of the press.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in NHS in Scotland about what Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU workers in Scotland for the NHS to express appreciation and worldly wishes to stay in post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter that was left 6 months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already decided to pay the required expense for the applications of EU citizens working for public service.
In his book, Nsz Freeman wrote: "In this manner, the conversations between the UK and the EU have calmly continued, looking for the decisions expected in the fall.
But the UK Government has also been preparing its plans to prevent the concordat.
I know this may not be a good time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize now how much I appreciate the work done by all the workers, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from the EU, as well as elsewhere, bring in a trillion of valuables and skills that strengthen and improve the health and health services of the health - care worker, to the benefit of the patients and the communities they work for.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie Has an Emergency Surgery After Headaches
Christianion Abercrombie player, who has undergone head injuries on Saturday at 3127 by Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State instructor Rod Reed told the news media that the injury happened just before vacation.
"You come to the bench and fall to the ground," says Reed.
The trainers and doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen on the bench before putting him on the stretcher to take him back to check.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has completed the operation at Vanderbilized Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘ there are no details about the type/size of injuries currently" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a red student, her first ordeal with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He has been able to stand five times a Saturday before leaving the game, which has made the total tragedy of standing 18 times.
Foreign buyers will be paid more money when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will be paid more money when they buy a UK home for this money to help the homeless under Tory’s new programs
This will make it difficult for Corbyn to find young people to vote.
An increase in the income level will be required of those who do not pay the UK tax.
Funds expect to earn about £20 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher salary if they buy an UK - this money to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be viewed as an attempt to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in trying to attract young people to vote for more affordable housing and to look for people who earn a lot of money.
A raise will work for people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and this added money will help in the State’s effort to eliminate the homeless.
This added amount to the current stamp money, including high - quality watches installed two years ago in the second and sold houses — may be 3 percent.
Financial authorities expect this to give them about £20 million a year.
About 13 percent of London's rebuilt homes are purchased by non-UK citizens, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new customers to obtain housing.
Many areas of the rich in this area, especially the capital - have become "cliques have become extinct" because of the high foreign consumers who spend most of their time away from the country.
The new trend came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke of a reduction in the cost of the stamp so that more young people could be helped to find the first houses.
She has organized construction operations by keeping up high - rise house prices by taking up the building site and not using it, and has urged Mrs.
Mr Corbyn has announced a dramatic series of proposed changes in the homes, including the management of rental money and the elimination of the ‘ infallible' of the house.
He also wants to supply larger forces to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: ‘ Last year I dedicated myself to revive Britain’s dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means repairing the real estate trade.
Britain will always be ready to welcome people who want to stay, work and build life here.
However, it would not be easier for non-UK people, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses than hardworking British citizens.
For so many people the dream of owning a house has become an impossible dream, and the lack of quality of lying down on the street never ends.
Jack Ross: 'My main dream is to be a Scotland instructor'
Sunderland Director Jack Ross says that he has the "great desire" to be a Scottish coach one day.
Ross, who is 42 years old, wishes the challenge of helping the North-East group, now the third in the League One, is left with three points by the top team.
You have moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after helping St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership in the past ordeal.
"I wanted to play my country as a performer.
I got a Bcap and it ended up," Ross tells BBC Scotland's Sports.
"But I have grown up to watch Scotland in Hammpden many times as a child, and I have always thought about it.
I can only get that opportunity, however, if I succeed as a class instructor.
Trains before Ross in Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyess, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Guy Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Ross, a former instructor of Alloy Athletic, said that he did not fear to join the main instructors in this large group, since he had rejected requests from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success of me now will be determined if I can return the group to the Premier League."
In view of the structure of the group, there is no doubt that it should be introduced to the Premier League," he says.
"It's not easy to take it back, but I'll probably see myself successful there if I can get the group back."
Ross has been an instructor for only three years, after a short time as an instructor in Dummarton and 15 months as a training worker for the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa escape from the pot, and he transformed St Mirren, which was almost eaten by the horn to be Championship champions for the next time.
And Ross says he feels more confident now than when he was a Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"The things suddenly changed completely," he recalls, by training Alloa.
"I was fully convinced that training work is good for me, more than being a player.
It sounds unreasonable because I played well, I was in good health, and there were things I enjoyed.
But playing is not easy.
There is so much to do every week.
I still do these things when stress and pressure come up, but I love training.
I have always wanted to train and now do it, I feel I am now doing something I want to do all my life as an adult."

The best time for the pin is 5,30pm on Saturday, says survey.
The influx of summer has brought Britain’s hard - packed branches to the market but has made it difficult for the restaurants to eat.
Bubbles and rubber groups increased by 2.7 percent by July - but in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent, says statistics.
Peter Martin, of thesis consultancy CGA, who has received these figures, says: "The continuing success and participation of England over the longer than expected in the World Cup means that July followed the same course of the past month of June, when the lungs rose by 2.8 percent, except that the restaurants stay below.
An 1.8 percent falling from the sale of restaurants in June has been worse by July.
Binge tubs and hamburgers are more popular than restaurants.
Lips sell food and carry it hard under the sun, although it was not as bad as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to get out of it for a drink.
For the branches and bars the sale of drinks has increased by 6.6 percent this month, the diet dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a social analyst and reception RSM, says: "These effects continue what we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major events or sports will always be powerful reasons when it comes to sales.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to toil, although sales are down by 4.8 percent every year will be painful despite continued expense problems.
The long hot summer has arrived very badly in the food market and in time it will appear that the low temperature we've had in August will give us what we need."
The increase in sales in the lungs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent by July, which showed a decrease in the rent.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the sale of the UK’s network of peaceful lungs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes the data of 47 working groups, producing more than £9 million, and is the beginning of a developing history.
One child in five has private Internet accounts that he has hidden from his parents
1 out of 5 - 11 - and 11 - with private contacts that he has hidden from his parents and teachers, reveals a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the "Insta" false pages.
The media bombard us with a list of sexual images
20 percent of people who say they have an account "The real" do not show children.
1 out of 5 - 11 - and 11-year-old - opens communications accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed rapid growth in the "Insta" accounts - referring to the Instagram photo site.
The news media create a climate of fear that the world will hear sexual scenes.
Twenty percent of those who claim to use a clean account are not showing the parents, while they have other secrets.
One mother who somehow saw the secret site of her 13 - year - old daughter found a youngster asking others to "take her away."
This study, of the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters "and Headmisers" (HMC) in private schools, found 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 with two profiles, half admitted to having private accounts.
“ It is disturbing, ” says HMC director Mike Buchanan, “that so many young people are tempted to build accounts on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot get it.
Elidh Doyle draws a "Player word" on the Scottish Atletics board
Elidh Doyle has been selected by the Scottish Atletics board as director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a popular Scottish athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie has described this act as a good opportunity for those who supervise sports to benefit from his large - scale sports team ten years ago.
"Elidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and all the world's players, and we are sure that Scottish sports will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I am determined to be the voice of the players and I hope to contribute more and to help regulate sports in Scotland.
This American player, who won 200 sets and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlanta games between his four Olympic sprints and is now a typical BBC expert, finds himself unable to walk after stroke (TIA).
He wrote to Twitter: "One month ago I died of a stroke.
I couldn’t move.
The doctors told me that it would in time be evident whether I would recover or how much.
In a coma, but I recovered fully, learned to walk, and today I can exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast-infecting advertisement that compares mother to cows causing a break in the Internet.
The breast-powder company has caused a break in the Internet with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
In order to mark the installation of what is said to be a "the world's first nonmodiary breast taper," Elvie company has released a comical music video advertisement to show freedom for the new breast-feeding mothers.
The four mothers sing a song in a cow box with the words: "Yes, I swallow myself, but you don't see the tail" and say "If you haven't seen this who is not milk, my breasts."
Says the rosary: "Bring out the faucet, take it out, feed it on the kids, take it out, take it out, and take it out, I feed my friends."
However, this advertisement, printed on this company's Facebook page, has caused controversy in the Internet.
This video consists of 77,000 who have seen it with hundreds of compartments, has received different views from observers, where many say that it is looked down on the ‘ weight ’ of the milk industry.
"The worst decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
Like us they need to become pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their children are taken after the days of birth, ” writes another.
The Elvie breast pump enters the inside of the breast brush (Elvie/Mther).
Another said: "It is a difficult situation for both mother and baby.
But why don't use a breast tap to advertise mothers who are unable to keep their children?
Another said: "This advertising is not appropriate."
Some have protected this advertisement, and one woman admitted that she had found a "smile."
"I think this is a good idea."
I would buy it if they were feeding me.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is exaggerated, but I have heard the meaning.
This product will really be useful," writes another.
One has adopted: "This advertisement is funny and refers to pumping mothers (usually at work or in private homes) and feels like "gowns."
This is not a advertising that glorifies or judges of the milk industry.
At the end of the video, the women’s group indicated that they had already danced with hidden pumps under their bells.
The purpose of the campaign is based on the belief that many women who use breasts say they feel like cattle.
But Elvie Pump, without noise, has no strings or tubes and wears it hidden under breast - feeding brush, gives women freedom to move, to touch their children, and to carry them out.
Ana Bararin, the ECD counterpart of Mother's, has noted: "Elvie Pmp is a product that will make a lot of difference and thus be appropriate for the presentation of it clearly.
By comparing women who are breast - feeding to cows we wanted to place breast - feeding with all its public challenges, while expressing in a pleasant and understandable way the feeling of relief that a new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie's gun has been known.
During London Fax Week, a mother of two children appeared in the cathalk of the designer Marta Jaboowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migratory Children Move to a Tent Camp on the Texas Coast
The number of adopted children has increased even though it did not change the monthly number of those who passed through the border, partly because hard-idented police put in the Trump office made it difficult to give support to the children.
Often, many activists are unsalaried immigrants, and they have been afraid to risk their stay here by identifying themselves as a parent.
The danger is serious in June, when the authorities announce that supporters and other adult members of the home will have to send fingerprints, and that the ring will be handed to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, admitted before the Congres that this license has arrested many people who are registered to support children without parents.
The law later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested were not guilty of crimes.
"About 80 percent of the people who don't support or have family members who are here illegally, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those people," says Mr. Albence.
Seeking to improve children quickly, officials have set up new rules that will require that some of them appear in court within a month, not after 60 days, which were the original rule, in accordance with herter's staff.
Most will appear on the video conference, not in person, to request legal rights in a foreign court.
Those considered unworthy will soon be deported.
If children stay in prison longer, there is more likely to be anxious or depressed, which may lead to violence or attempt to run away, in accordance with herlter workers and reported reports from the mast during the past months.
The attorneys say that the anxiety is growing at a larger center such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is having difficulty may be ignored, because of the size of the area.
They also add that moving the children to the tent city without taking the time to prepare themselves emotionally or say good - bye to friends can cause many of the problems they already have.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish troops to withdraw quickly
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem spoke to the Syrians to return home, even though the war in their country is now in its eighth year.
The Moualem, also the prime minister's assistant, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syria, that they would bring an end to terrorism, and that they would "be handled accordingly."
"He must go quickly without orders," and tell the audience.
Moulem asserts that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been displaced from their homes.
Damascus, he said, will continue "fighting this sacred war and purify the whole area of Syria" from terrorist groups and "anyone from another country."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are heavily involved in training and directing troops in Kurdish and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 veterans in a war- ravaged country.
As for refugees, Moulem says that circumstances permit them to return, and he blames "some western countries" for“ fearing them" to prevent refugees from returning.
He said, "We have spoken to the international public and social organization to make sure that refugees are returning."
"They are politically responsible for a matter that should be addressed only to the welfare of the community."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help her Syria again until a political concordat between Assad and anti-war parties.
UN agents say that a newly formed contract between Russia and Turkey to form a border on the Idrab last stronghold of its Idlibs is an opportunity to carry on political discussions.
The Russian and Turkish concordats have prevented a major attack on Russian - sponsored military forces in a province, where three million people live.
However, Moulem emphasized that the treaty "had been set a clear time" and hopes that the soldiers will attack the Jestra Front and the Nustra Front members who are associated with Al-Qaeda, "they will be killed."
UN Secretary - General Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon you will arrange for the first meeting of a new committee involving the government and opposing members to be registered after the Syrian war and to arrange for election.
Moualem has set the limits of the Syrian government's participation on the committee, saying that the governor's work should end up with "looking at the articles of the new constitution," and warned of emergency.
Why will Trump win a second option?
In that sense, Mr. Trump can win the second election by 2020 except if, as there are many non-supers who may wish to be so, who are dishonest and do wrong that would take him off instead of president.
There can be no doubt that that is "It will be the most important conclusion in the history of the president!"
So far, there is no indication that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, CNN viewers have doubled to 1,05 million and observers at MSNBC have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.

Large sums of money are inserted in a medieval house competition
It is not surprising that 17th the 17th of 17 earns large sums of money, thanks to the restructuring of the co-constitutions and two executives from the same seat.
The newly painted Pittsburgh district set him up in the Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb - who defeated his chair in another province in a special election last spring.
Lamb still competes with another conference, the Republican Keith Rothfus, now representing the old state of Pennsylvania 12, which runs into the full 17 new.
Maps were drawn again after the Pennsylvania High Court decided on January that the old states broke the law by stealing votes to the Republicans.
The competition in this new 17th has removed the financial competition between members of the main team, the Democratic Congeral Community Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Company Committee (NRC).
The name Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a special March election that was watched by many Pennsylvania's 18th Congress.
That position has been held by the Republicn for more than ten years, President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given the Democratic inhabitants a measure of opportunity.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador by Supporting China, It Was Recasting
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have noticed Beijing, with a little supplication from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a free meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and became a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Organization's administrative unit.
The State Department officials have decided to call again the American Diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on "the latest decision not to cooperate with Taiwan," Heather Nauert, who spoke at the door, says at the beginning of this month.
But El Salvador is paid only for $140 million for helping America in 2017, and for control of narctics, development and economic support.
A proposed fine, which included financial amputees and distributed restrictions on identitys, may be painful to the country in Central America because of the increase in unemployment and murder.
As their conferences improved, North America and Central America held a high conference focused on protecting and improving the economy in order to follow the same event last year that was considered to be a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid- September, high officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively ending any idea of the fines of El Salvador.
President Mike Perce's vice president should now arrange to speak with the conference, which is now scheduled to be in mid-October, as a symbol by the administrators to the conference, say the officials.
And three American representatives peacefully returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without strong new messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's Master House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two messengers, who agreed to discuss the inner intentions of the privacy.
Their accounts are confirmed by an external investigator closest to rulers and discussed the nature of privacy.
A Lesson in History
The following scenario may be the report of Robert Mueller's special adviser against Mr. Trump, and now there is considerable evidence on the public record.
Mr Mueller is said to be investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign was connected with Russia in his attempt to attack our choice.
If Congregs change, Mr. Trump will find himself in the hearing of this body, as he prepares for the presentation of the vote, and perhaps finally before the court.
This has many limitations, and I do not mean that the fall of Mr. Trump will definitely happen to Europe.
There are decisions all of us should make on both sides of the Atlantic to affect the length of the conflict.
In 1938, German officials were ready to set up a coup d'état against Hitler, as long as the West was against him and supported the Czechoslovakias in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History is in the course of such events, and the relentless pursuit of popular will soon take its toll, or it will go a long way through the years.
The Americans are now experiencing many of these events.
What would we do if Mr. Trump drove Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and expressing his inability to carry out his work.
Mr Rosenstein says the story of The Times is not accurate.
"How will we react if a new investigation of F.B.I. Brett Kavanough is incomplete or unjust - or if taken to the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in medieval Congrress to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do so, much less accomplish the will of the majority of mankind.
But I believe we will never fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz to the same Nazi regime that once ruled over my agency.
She survived, moved to America, and, after 60 years, sent me to light Sabbath candles at the swastika table.
With that as an inheritance, how can I be without any hope for our future? ’

Graham Dorrans of Rangers hope as the game approaches Rapid Vienna
Rangers play home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrian victory, after playing equally in Spain with the Villarreal before this month, will put them in a good chance to pass through the EuroG of the European League.
A knee injury prevents stomach player Graham Dorrans from playing again in agony until they play equally with Villarreal but believe that Rangers can use those effects to look forward to larger things.
"It was good to find this point because Villarreal is a good team," says this 31-year-old player.
"We’ve gone into the game believing that we will return with something, and we got the point.
We may have found a goal toward the end but, otherwise, to play equally well.
They played better than we did at first, and on the second, they became our best players.
On Thursday, we are playing another European game.
We hope we will find three points but it will be a hard game because they have played well in the past but, because our followers will be there to encourage us, I’m sure we’ll play and get good results.
Last year, during all the things that have happened through my injuries and changes in the group itself, things seem to be going to improve right now.
The games are wholesome and enjoyable; they are enjoyable too.
We hope we will work now, go through the past grief and win."
Women are unable to sleep because they fear retirement

Nearly half of those polled said that they spoke with their spouse about the cost of extended care.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake and a tsunami in an Indonesian city called Palu on Friday, the authorities said, the number of dead is expected to increase.
Since communications are not in use, relief workers were unable to obtain information from Donggaga authorities, the northern part of Palu near the center of the 7.5 earthquakes.
In Plu, more than 16,000 people were abandoned after the disaster.
Here are some important truths about Palu and Dongga, on the island of Sulawesi:

Palu and Dongga have been bombarded by tsunamis several times a hundred years ago, according to Indonesia's Disiserigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongga.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is in the moving area of the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often struck by an earthquake.
Here are some of the places that have been hit by major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:

Public prosecutors demand an unusual death sentence from a terrorist in the NYC
The public prosecutors in New York sought the death sentence of Sayfullo Saipov, a New York City terrorist who killed eight people -- an unusual sentence that had not been executed on the area since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used a rented Home Depot truck to attack the West Side Highway on Lower Manhattan, which struck and killed both pedestrians and cyclists on that route by Oct.
In order to achieve capital punishment, prosecutors will have to show that Saipov has purposely executed eight people and "willingly" wound them with severe physical injuries, in accordance with the notice of an attempt to obtain a death sentence, issued by the Southern District of New York.
Both acts constitute the severity of the death sentence, in line with the court’s justice.
After some weeks, the question court presented Saipov with 22 cases involving eight cases of murder, often used by public prosecutors in organized criminal cases, as well as in cases of violence and car crashes.
The attack has required "prediction and good judgment," said the prosecutors, explaining how the Saipov has done, is cruel and shocking.
"Sayfullo Habullaev has wounded you, killed the families and friends of Diego Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the court notice.
The five slain were visitors from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York last handled the death sentence.
The defendant, Calaid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug addicts but ended up in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence in the New York court was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married people who were executed after adoption were guilty of stealing from the Soviet Union for information during the Coral War two years previously.
Both the Rosenbergs were killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, of Uzbekistan, has shown that he has no heart in the days and months following the attack, according to a court hearing.
She told the interrogators that she felt good about what she had done, and the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that his attack had caused him to watch ISIS videos on his phone, in accordance with his alleged statements.
She also asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in her hospital room, the police said.
She is not responsible for the 22 charges against them.
David Patton, defense of the society representing the Saipov, says that "they are as disappointed as expected" by a court decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence is more than to accept a request to be thrown into prison without a chance of release will only make it easier to be shocked in these circumstances for all participants," says Patton.
The Saipov rescue team had asked the prosecutor not to accept the death sentence.
Tory Minister says NIGEL FRANCE should direct talks and Brexit
Nigel Fagege vowed to ‘ organize a community' today during the protest of the Tory camp.
A former Ukip leader says that politicians had to be ‘ tortured ’ by the Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May’s prime minister said he should be in charge of the talk and the EU.
A non-constitution member Peter Bone told the rioters at Birmingham that the UK might have gone out' now if Mr Fage was Brexit's Secretary.
But Mrsz May's challenge in gathering together members of his separated group is noted by the older Tory members who join a different protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fails to keep his Chequers program moving smoothly despite the Brexit, Remainers, and EU members attack.
Some members have insisted that they would go ahead and try to make an agreement with Brussels despite the conflict that existed - and force the Eurosceptics and Labours to choose between his ‘ chaos' package.
Mr Bone has told the Leave Means Leave in Solhull that you want to 's finish with Chequers'.
He said Mr Faage should be made a pillar and assigned a task of communication with Brussels.
'If you were the one, we'd be out now,' he said.
Wellingborough has added: ‘ I will represent Brexit but we have to finish with Chequers.'
Describing his clash with the EU, he says: 'We have not fought the wars of the world, that we may be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone has published the arguments that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The opinion that the British people have changed the idea and are ready to stay is not true.'
Andrea Jenkyns of Tory’s sponsor Brexit was also in the riot, telling the officers: ‘ I mean, Sir, listen to the people.
'People don't want Chequers, the opposing team will not vote, our group doesn't want ours and ours going on the streets, and they have invited us in the first place.
Please forget with Chequers that you start listening.'
In a straightforward message to Mrs. May, he said, 'O Presidents continue to perform their duties if they keep their promises.'
Mr Fage told the politician in the exhibition that they must be 'pressed' if they forget the decisions they made in the 2016 March 2016.
'This is now a matter of loyalty between us - and our political class,' he says.
'They try to be disloyal to Brexit and we are here today to tell them, 'We' won't let you do that."
In a strong message he tells the crowd: ‘ I want to make the political party, now they are in danger of breaking Brexit, and they feel oppressed.
'We're using this country' which has made us victorious in Brexit and will not lose courage to become an independent, independent country, the proud United Kingdom.'
In the meantime, the Remainers have rioted at Birmingham before having a two-hour roll call in the city.
The leading detectives carried signs called Tories Against Brexit after grouping the week.
Labour member Lord Adonis made a joke about Conservatives ’ safety problems that they had with a group application at the opening of the conference.
'These are people who tell us that they can set up the firms of IT with all Canadian technology and so forth, a trouble-free border, free trade with Ireland, add.'
'It' is a total destruction.
There is no such thing as Brexit,' adds.
Warren’s plans for 'respair' for entry president selection
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says that she will look closely at the president's option after November option.
The Boston Globe reports that this Massachusetts Democratic spoke of the future at a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.

She was in a large chance to compete with Trump by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Hotewe was his 36th assembly using the city hall since Trump became president.
You have found out if you are planning to join in.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington to set matters straight for our corrupt government, and that includes a woman who will be president."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton draws closer to the earth beauty after following group guidelines that gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was evident that the Valter Bottas succeeded over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the directions of the Mercedes team will play a major role in the race.
From the beginning, Bottas started out well and likely competed with Hamilton as he defended her position on the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack a gang member.
Vettel entered the pits first and left Hamilton blocked by the crew tail, which should have been the determining factor.
Mercedes enter the pit after the cycle and it was behind Vettel, but Hamilton was in front of the contest that caused Ferrari driver to be forced to leave the inside safe after two protective turns on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the rear line of the grid and was the seventh at the end of the first cycle on his 21st birthday.
Then he leads a large part of the race as he has continued his wheels so as to press on to finish fast and pass the Kimi Raikkonen to be the fourth.
He finally reached the pits on the 44th cycle but was unable to increase his speed in the eight remaining cycles as Raikkonen was fourth.
The day is hard because Valtri has done a good job the whole weekend and has been kind and generous to me.
The group has done the recommended task of having 1.2," says Hamilton.
His Body’s Routine Has Been Rich
President Donald Trump made fun of the Sanitor Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday conference as he insisted that he did not show anyone a letter from Christine Black Ford accusing the High Court accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking in a West Virginia conference, the president did not specifically mention the evidence given by the Ford before the Senate Financial Committee, but noted that what happened to Senate showed that people were "unreasonable and ungenerous and dishonest."
"One thing that could happen and that was good going on in the past few days in Senate, when you see wrath, when you see angry and unkind and insensitive and unfaithful, says."
"When you look at the broken news and say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do You Recall?
Did Dianne Feinstein tell someone?
You remember her answer...
Oh, no.
I didn't send anyone.
Well, wait for a minute.
We sent him... No, no one," he said, referring to the senator.
Feinstein received a detailed letter about Kavanough's trial by the Ford back in July, and it appeared in early September - but Feinstein denied that this commission had come out of his office.
"I did not hide the claims of Dr. Ford, I sent no one," Feinstein informs the committee, reports The Hill.
"You have asked me to keep it a secret and have kept it as secret as I have requested."
But his denial did not sound well to the president, who has commented during a Saturday night gathering: “As I say, His movement is rich.
He may not have done it, but his bodily movement is rich.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court defendant, who was accused of abuse of three women, the president said that Democrats used charges for their benefits.
"They are willing to fight for power by whatever he may do.
He sees a lack of kindness, a lack of concern, who is injured, who should pass over to dominate and control," reports the Median in the words of the president.

Dwyer has seen to it that the Giants take the lead when they come to the vacation when they hit his second goal that day towards the end of the first plane.
The group he was playing at home returned violently, and Bouchard again struck a beautiful scale at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have met to help Nielsen hit the Dundee track for the first time in the game toward the end of the second track and made sure they won the game by playing the fifth time toward the end of the game.
The Giants, now beaten in their four games of the past five, played home with Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A pilot Kills to Rescue Hundreds of People From an Earthquake
The pilot in Indonesia is credited after death to ensure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers arrives safely down.
More than 800 people are dead and most are still not found after the great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which started the tsunami.
There is strong movement to continue its attack, and many are trapped in the city of Palu.
But even though her colleagues had fled to escape, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunan Aung refused to leave work on a building that was struggling to control aircraft at Mutiara Shis Al Jufri Airport in Pallu port.
She lived to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on course, would be able to move safely.
He then jumps out of the control tower while he thinks we are going to collapse.
He has died later in the hospital.
Air Navigaration correspondent in Indonesia, Yohannes Strait, said that this decision could save hundreds, reports Australia's ABC News.
We have arranged a helicopter from Balikpan in Kalimtan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we failed and have died this morning before the plane reached Palu.
"Our hearts are pained to hear this," he has added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands as the emergency services call it difficult to enter the cities of Dongga, Sig, and Bourung.
"We believe that the number of dead is still rising as many bodies are still in ruins while there are many that we could not reach," says communications spokesman Sutopo Pulo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] above sea level have destroyed Palu that will have a mass burial on Sunday.
Warplanes and freight bring relief supplies and life’s necessities.
Risa Kusumu, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: Every minute an ambulance brings dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The markets have been plundered everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the international Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia helps survivors but does not know what they will find there.
This is already a disaster, but it can be even worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widdo comes to Pulu on Sunday and tells the military force: "I ask all of you to work day and night to finish all work on the disfellowshipping.
Are you ready?" Save CNN.
Indonesia has been hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok where more than 550 people have died.
Micronesia crash: Air Nicigini now says that one person has been lost after a plane crash in a Lagosn plane crash
The Airline that controls a crash in the Pacific lapoon in Micronesia now says there is only one out of sight, after all 47 passengers and crews are safely taken out of a sinking plane.
The Air Niugin has said that since Saturday afternoon, he cannot tell of a male passenger.
The Airline says that she has been working with local officials, hospitals and investigators to try to find this man.
The Airline did not respond immediately when asked to reveal details of the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats have helped other passengers and crew after the plane has crashed into the water while attempting to sail to the Chuk Island port.
The authorities had seven persons taken to the hospital on Friday.
The Airline says six passengers are left in the hospital on Saturday, and all are in a safe eye.
The cause of the airplane crash and how this has happened is not clear.
The Airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the cable in the lapoon has not yet reached the airport route.
Some Witnesses think that the plane is over.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that a cable is in the water at low speed.
"The really good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes and others were able to travel through the water, which she kept on her waist to the recorded flights.
He said that the crews were rushing and talking, and that you had a little bruise in your head.
The U.S. Navy says that crew crews who improve thewharf have also helped out by using a winding boat to reach the shore before the plane sinks more than 100 feet [30 m] into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that11 people have died in a PNG-registered aircraft crash in the last 20 years, but nothing includes Air Niue.
Analyst identifies the night period of a burned woman alive
The prosecutor took charge on Saturday against a man suspected of burning a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for many hours as an expert witness in the field of introgence nalysis.
She has told the jury how she has used telephone records to find the places that 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett has found details about the place on several calls that indicated that Tellis was with Chammers on the afternoon of his death, contrary to what he said earlier, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When details indicate that his phone call was on Cdbers during the time he had a friend of yours; here Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was correct when she said that she was in the Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "theey because his truck was in Nashville."
Another difference is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks before he died.
Telephone records show one another for a week.
Rowlet says that some time before Chamberers died, Tellis turned off Chamber text, telephones, and phone and phone information.
And he took him out of his life, saith Hale.
The suspect is arranged to start talking on Sunday.
The judge expected him to report to the jury on the very day.
High Breed: What is Conscious hip hop?
The hip hop group wants to challenge this type of music by filling their songs with encouraging words.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says Hip hop is no longer what it was before by having political messages and talking about social problems.
She wants to return to justice and has been given another reputation.
Musicians like The Fugees and Commons have later seen the rise of the UK in song as Akaka and Lowkey.
Someone black?!
A UY baby watcher accuses parents of expelling her with a message of "prediction"
A child watcher in New York accuses a husband and his wife by expelling her with racist remarks after having received a message from the mother of the errant child saying "I was another black person."
The parents deny that they are prejudiced, saying that the charges are made for "in the interest of money."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when he learned that he was going to watch over his young child, Giselle Maurice, a black person when he arrived on the first day to work in 2016.
" NOOOOOOOOOOO STA," writes Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in writing to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her, Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After seeing his supervisor, "free" Plasco-Flaxman expelled Nsz. Maurice, saying that the departing guard of her children, who is African-American, did a poor job and was waiting for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Msz. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then was assigned to our home by Uber.
Now, Maurice accuses the parents of unjustly expelling her, and he seeks a compensation of 350 dollars for 6 months, and the Live-in gig, which she is known for, except for a contract.
"I wanted to show that, behold, that was not done," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know that it is prejudice."
The parents replied that they are prejudiced, reasoning that expelling Maurice was the best thing for them, fearing that they would no longer trust him.
"My wife sent her that which she didn't want to say.
He does not harbor animosity toward them.
We are not the victims of prejudice," said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But can you leave your children with a person who was fair to you, even by mistake?
Your new son or daughter?
In fact.
Comparing this charge with "the money settlement," Plasco says that his wife has been born two months after she has become a child and "in the most difficult condition."
"You will attack such a man?
It is by no means a good thing," institutionanker adds.
As the case goes on, the court of opinion has been quick to accuse the parents from social networking sites, not encouraging what they have done.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not like the document that was being discussed, revealing a newspaper
Bond’s daughter, Jankel, who was born after the book was loved, said in a letter: “It is hard to place yourself in the shoe of a reader before it is printed.
It is a pleasure to know what we now know about Paddington's success.
He says that his father, who has worked on BBC as a photographer before he was moved to write a children's note about the bear of a small one, would not be discouraged if his work was not appreciated, added 60th anarchical publishing of his books to be "expressure and fun" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which defined him as ‘ the most important member of our family, ’ he added that his father did not take pride in his success.
"He was a quiet man, and was not proud," he told them.
"But because Paddington was real to me, it was like if you have a child who has accomplished something: you are proud of it even if it didn't work for you.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success that way.
Even though she was formed and thought of her, she always praised Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to phone her to her
When her daughter rented her was rushed to Nice’s Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked hard to save her life.
"Nad always said it's too bad, saying he didn't expect to survive," says Mrs Edna-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone from Nad saying that he would die two minutes from now, and I had to say to him.
And I said good - bye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, and don't cry."
Soon I will be with you.
I will be with you.
The drugs prescribed for her to maintain her heart rate gradually decreased, and she lost weight.
She had died some time before and was no longer employed.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I could not scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I really had to control myself.
Finally Mrs Edna-Laperouse, now mourning over her dead daughter, boarded an airplane with other passengers — apparently because of the tragic situation she was facing.
"No one knew," he told them.
“ I looked down, and tears came down every time.
It is hard to explain, but I was on a plane when I felt sorry for Nad.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I know how she loved her."
A woman installs cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones in death worked together to prevent others from killing them.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were the first time they displayed cards on a Welsh bridge with encouraging words and telephone numbers to be used for help.
Nsz Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I do every day," says Mrsz Davis.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a cook with a promising future and that when he smiled everyone had a smile.
"All people knew of her smile.
They always said that when you smile it is all good."
Nevertheless, he quit his job before he died, since he was "very depressed."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the first to find him after he committed suicide.
Msz Davis said: ‘ I always worry that something is going to happen like this. ’
Msz Davis started making cards, "to let people know that there are people to talk to, even if it can be a friend.
Don't bottle up your feelings - you have to talk.
Msz Humphreys, a friend of Nsz Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15 - year - old aunt, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling down or depressed or said anything," he tells.
"Just a few days before Christmas we noticed a different way of doing things.
He said that on Christmas Day he was a little lower than when children opened their gifts without looking in the eye or doing something.
He said that his death caused them much distress, but they had to cope with it: “It is leaving a void in the family.
It hurts us a lot.
But all of us must continue to fight.
If it is difficult to cope with death, you can call the Samatans free of this number of 11643 (UK and Ireland), email jo@saritans.org, or visit the Samamatan website.
The future of Brett Kavanough is not sure as the FBI starts investigation
"I would think, if we could actually find something like what they were looking for, a quick inquiry - we could bring an interconnection," says Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "divided" since there were many supporters.
Why do Sir Kavanough and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do investigation?
The thing they dislike is due time.
The medieval choice will reach five weeks, November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans will not succeed, and then they will be weakened in their efforts to find the one they want in the highest court.
George W. Bush has been on the telephone calling to the Senators, encouraging them to support Mr Kavanug, who worked at the White House for Mr Bush and there met his wife Ashley, who was Sir Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI has released its report?
There will be a selection of Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democratics.
It is still still not clear whether Mr Kavanough can obtain about 50 votes from Senate, which will allow Mike Perce, the vice president, to divide the equality and present him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's heretics are being reduced' under Kim
The number of rebels in North Korea to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong-un began ruling seven years ago, says a South Korean law expert.
Park Yeong-seug, quoting details of the South Allied department, says that last year there were 1,127 revolutions - compared with 2,706 by 2011.
Mr Park says that border laws are enforced between North Korea and China and the high cost required by private employees is a major factor.
Pyongngy did not observe anything in the community.
A large number of rebels from North are eventually granted citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled to China, which has a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) which has the defenses between two Koreans.
China views these rebels as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and is often forcibly returned to their homelands.
The relations between North and South - today that are still at war have in some sense improved dramatically over the past months.
In early this month, leaders of these two countries met in Pyongngy and discussed primarily the establishment of nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after the June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on several ways to work to eliminate nuclear weapons in Korea.
But Saturday, North Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs R Yong-ho accused the US authorities of taking action since.
"Unless the US has confidence, there will be no confidence in our country's security and under those circumstances, we will never have to close our weapons alone first," says Mr. Ri in a talk to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanough "you are in charge of feelings," saying that she is unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
House House Minor Leader Nancy Pelos called the candidate of the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanough as "the one controlled by feelings" and said that his emotions also do not allow him to work in the Supreme Court.
Peter says these words in a Saturday conversation in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I immediately thought that if a woman has done such a thing, it'll be said that she'll be ‘ controlled by feelings,' said Peter with his reply to Kavanough in front of the Sanate Financial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanough has said with great emotion that you have hit Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
During his opening remarks, Kavanough expressed emotions, at other times screaming and being shocked when he was discussing his family and his high school years.
He also denounced the Democrats to the committee, calling the charges against the person's being "planned to be executed" in a manner designed to provoke the offense that Hillary Clinton was broken in the 2016 election.
Peter said that he believed that Kavanough's evidence shows that he would fail the Supreme Court, because it shows that he was against the Democratics.
"I think he makes himself unfit by those words and by the way he spoke about Clinton's wives and Democrats," he said.
Pesoles refused when asked if he would try to accuse Kavanough when put on, and Democrats found many seats in the House of Redesertitis.
"This is what I will say -- if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, it means that he is unfit not only to the Supreme Court, but also to his present court," says Peso.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in D.C. C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Peter has added that like Democrat he is concerned that Kavanough might judge against Affordable Care Act or Roe v. old, since he is thought to be an arbitrary judge.
When questioned, Kavanough did not answer the questions as to whether he could answer certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotional, neutral person to go to court and it is expected to say, 'It' until it's good,' says Peter.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Power.
Proper discipline, months and years of wrath are raging, and there is no other way to let you cry.
"We cry when we are upset," Msz. Steinem told me that 45 years later.
"I don't think that is unusual, what do you say?"
He added, ‘ I was very much helped by the woman who was a manager, who said that she cried when she was upset, but found out that when she was upset and cried, she would say to the person she spoke to, ‘ You might think I was upset because I cried.
I'm angry.
Then she went.
I also thought that was good."
Tears flow as a way to let go of anger because they sorely need people.
One of my earliest memories, the office full of men, when I found myself crying for anger that I could not describe, was pulled in the narrow neck with a scarf that I had always pulled from the stairs.
"See that they don't see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know that you're angry with a mandrakes.
They think you are upset and will be happy because you have found it."
Patricia Schroeder, who became a Democratic Congregationman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught committing adultery on a ship called Monkey Business and was taken out of the election, Msz. Schroeder, with great anger, realized that he could not satisfy his desire to enter the election as president.
"It was not a well-equipped decision," he said to me while he was laughing some 30 years later.
"For a long time there were seven others in the race, and the object of ridicule was waiting for the other.
One calls it " Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was about to end, she had no money to compete, so she vowed that she would not enter the race until she had $2 million.
It was a war I would never win.
He found that some supporters who gave $1,000 million to men could give him $250.
"They think I am getting the loss?" He wondered.
When he declared that he would not engage in an organized campaign, he was overwhelmed with admiration by people who supported him, a lump in his throat that made spending more of money and looking for people to vote than for members, and an angry outburst of prejudice toward women in which he had been trapped.
"You would think I am in," recalls Mrs. Schroeder, and how the news media responded to him.
"You can imagine that Kleenex will become a concrete sponge.
I remember thinking, what will they put in my grave?
"She stayed"?"
How the US - China trading battle can be beneficial at Beijing
The salvos to open the trade war between the US and China were closing ears, and as the war is on the horizon, the conflict between these countries can be of interest to Beijing in the future, say experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, has issued the first warning earlier this year by importing supplies for China as well as for electrical, iron and aluminum containers.
The biggest problem that happened this week with new tables affecting the cost of $1,200 Billion (£150 Billion), adding half of all US import goods from China.
Beijing has returned each time in the same way, recently depositing 5 to 10 percent of American goods worth $60 Billion.
China has asked to be equal to the US camash, and the second largest economy in the world is less likely to fall in the near future.
To put the Washington off the back means to close the corner with its demands, but to bow publicly to the US can be a great embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, researchers say that if Beijing can act intelligently, the tension of trade with the US can reap China for a long time by reducing the interaction between the two parties.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create economic problems in both countries is more dangerous than observers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, a researcher on Asia in the Center for New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Syria says she is ready to return willingly to the refugees and seeks help to rebuild the occupied land for seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem says that conditions in the world are improving.
"Today the situation is relatively calm and safe because of the progress made against terrorism," he says.
The government continues to clean up areas damaged by terrorist attacks in order to restore normal life.
All circumstances now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the land where they had to flee because of terrorism and the oppressive economic laws that assault their everyday lives and way of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled this area since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the area need material assistance.
Al-Moulem has said that the Syrian Empire would be happy to help rebuild a war- ravaged land.
But he stressed that they would not accept inadequate help or assistance from countries where protests were common.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won in 2018 the Ryder Cup by defeating the USA team with points 16.5 - 10.5 at the Le Golf National except Paris, France.
The US has now been eaten six times in quick succession in Europe and has never won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again received the prize as the Danish captain team Thomas Bjorn reached the points needed to conquer the United States.
The U.S. ring Phil Mickelson, which has been heavily loaded throughout the race, puts his tee-shlot in water in a par-3 hole of 16, his game was taken by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Mininari has played well in all of his operations, and he has been 1 out of 4 to 5-0 since the format of the current competition began in 1997.
American Jordan Spieth is released in 52.5.4 by the lowest player in a European group, Thorbjorn Olen of Denmark.
The world’s top player, Dustin Johnson, split by 2 and 1 by English Ian Poulter, who may have been playing in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cups Forces, Spaniard Sergio Garcia won more victory than any other European contest by 25.5 points.
"I don't cry often, but today I can't control myself.
This was a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas to be chosen and trusted by me.
I am so happy that we received a cup of money again.
We are working for the team. I am happy that I was able to help," says Garcia after winning in Europe.
He passes the job to his fellow John Ram, who has broken the U.S. sextilloph compass Tiger Woods by 2.2 July 1 to a single player on Sunday.
"I am very proud, as I conquer Tiger Woods, and grow up watching," says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods is defeated in all four of his French games and now has a record of 13-21-3 on the Ryder Cup record.
The rare numbers of one of the most famous players in history, who has won 14 major peaks, are second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has struggled the whole weekend to get fairways except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who play high-level golf in the whole race.
US captain Jim Furryk has spoken after a team game, "I’m proud of our players, they’re working.
There was a time in the morning when we had oppressed Europe.
We couldn’t.
You have used Thomas.
You are the best captain.
All 12 players have played very well.
To modify, I will work with the PGA of America with our Ryder Cup Committee and continue.
I like the 12 players and am proud to be a captain.
You should offer advice to your captain.
We are distinguished."
Recent Red Tide: Numbers in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A new report from Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a decrease in Red Tide numbers in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, diversity of production in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Colliers - may indicate a decrease in numbers.
The production of Red Tide grows about 150 miles off the coast from north of Pinelas to south of the Lee areas.
Differences can be found in about 10 miles from the Hillsborough County coast, but in a few places more than in the previous weeks.
Red Tide has also been seen in Pasco County.
Low prices from the Pirillas County coast have been reported in the previous year, lower to the upper deck of Hillsborough County, back to the highest figures of Manatee County, back to higher rates between or off the Sarasota County, back to the mid-the centre of Charlotte County, back to higher or lower rates between the Lee County.
Breathing disorders continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and areas of Collier.
Breathing disorders were not reported in Northwest Florida last week.
