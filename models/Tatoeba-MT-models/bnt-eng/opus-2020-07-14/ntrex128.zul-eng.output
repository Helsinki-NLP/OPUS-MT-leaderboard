Welsh Ams are concerned that ‘ they will look like something to eat'
They ask themselves and answer some among the AMs in the view that they have changed their MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parties).
This is removed by the reformation programs for the Welsh Parliament’s membership.

One member of Labour AM said they were afraid because there is a noise similar to Twp and Pwp.
For students outside of Wales: According to Welsh wetdrop you mean stupid and pp means waste.
The Plad AM class was happy as a group and gave other names to which they could not be selected.
The Welsh Conservative member said that as a group they were willing to accept the change of the name but noted that MWP is very close to being named.

This Joint Commission, which repeats the policy of a change of the term, said: "The final decision by specifying this identification of the members of the law will be the subject which will be the solely the members of the control."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 granted the Welsh organization the right to change their name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public poll by means of opinions, which received a major restructuring of the organization called Welsh parliament.
In the case of the Ms commission, the WMP is established and the public opinion has proved to be dependent on MWP.

The AM will have the final word on what they will be called when the law is discussed.

Their method of play has not changed since they return to the gear, but we should commend Holt for the way he prepared the team for coming.
You have won many champions.
Captain Halket was outstanding, his wall firmly fixed, while Menga kept Conn or Goldon and Joe Worroll stared at the whole game.
The Rangers were looking around, but.
Or they do well under the rule of Gerard, by keeping those values to a minimum.
Their last shot is to swim -- Once they have opened the home hole – Rangers must rise from the eggs, as they find themselves in the middle of the table.

Disagreements about such problems as the rights of the people, the freedom of the journalists, and the exodus of Turkey from the EU have occurred.
Erdogan will move to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to many of the Turks outside of Turkey.
Police maintain security conditions as they prevent 25,000 people from standing in front of the mosque, but there are a number of bystanders lying nearby to see their president.
Thousands of opposing protesters of Erdogan- many of them are krdish- and want their words to be heard, taking into account the law of Erdogan and the German government now accept him into the country.
This issue points to differences of opinion in connection with the seemingly heroic tourist who is a hero to the German Turks and as an opposition to others.

Hundreds are killed by earthquakes, tsunamis, and tsunamis.
At least 384 people have died, most of them in large waves during horse attacks, when earthquakes and tsunamis hit the Indonesian peninsula of Sulawesi, saying to officials on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a party on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the 18 feet [18 m] of the waves were hit in the bank at the ninth hour, killing many at their death and destroying everything along the way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of about 25 feet [7.5 m].
"When the tsunamis arose on Thursday, people were doing their work on the beach and did not rush and become victims," says Sutopo Puro Nucroho, who speaks for Indonesia, in an attack on the BNPB disaster.
"The tsunami didn't arrive alone, she dragged cars, timbers, houses, hit everything on the ground," said Nucroho, adding that the tsunami was crossing the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the sands.
Some people climb into the trees to escape Tsunami, he says.
About 17,700 persons were moved to 24 centers in Palu.
Antiaircraft gunned by the center of the disaster showed dozens of buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed, and emptys, as well as water - cinders.
The quake continues to move the coastal city for the rest of the Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was reaching an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Accomposition of Technology (BPT) says that the power released by an earthquake on Friday was 200 percent of the atomic power that hit Hiroshima in World War II.
The city’s logography, which is located at the end of a long half, smaller, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described such damage as "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels have collapsed.
Members of some victims have been found confined under the drum of fallen buildings, who, she said, embraced 540 injured persons and 29 died.
Nucroho has said that those injured and damage may be larger along the coast of 200 miles [300 km] north of Palu, a place called Dongga, near the quacker.
The connection "Contradicted" is unknown from Dongga, namely Nucroho.
There are more than 300,000 people who live there, "the Red Cross," in the commission, adding that its crew and the volunteers went to the affected areas.
It is said, 'This has already been a disaster but is still worse than this.'
The generals on Saturday were widely criticized for not saying that the tsunami struck Palu, although the authorities said that the water had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
A video that was shared in the social environment may hear a man down the building may sound a false warning about a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes the water wall of the sea, which removes buildings and vehicles.
The Reuters individuals were unable to verify the video genuineness as soon as possible.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have resulted in the loss of electricity and communications in Palu that has made it difficult for officers to direct relief efforts.
The soldiers who have begun to transport cargo from Jakarta and other cities, says the authorities, but the survivors need food and other basic needs.
The home airport is only open to relief efforts and will close up until October.
President Joko Seddo is scheduled to visit parks in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia Tsunami Toll is higher than 800.
It is very serious.
By the time the World Vision workers came from Dongga, they have settled in a safe area in Palu, where the workers live in shelters built in their office yard, they take drugs along the way, says Mr. Doba.
They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed, saying.
It’s worse.
Even as relief groups began to blow up the bells, some complained that the well - informed foreign workers had been prevented from leaving Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, goods, goods and personnel from abroad can begin to be flooded if a disaster site is said to be a national disaster site.
That does not happen.
"It will be only a state disaster" says Aulia Arriani, Commenting on the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says, 'Well, this is a national disaster," we will not allow foreign aid but is not yet possible.
As the two nights after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami in Palu, friends and family of those still alive hoped that loved ones would be miraculous cures for natural disasters.

On Sunday, the nurses released a woman who had been trapped under a rag for two days with her mother’s body at his side.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian disability instructor, has trained two disabled persons who are lost in Asian sports, which are assembled at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were locked in a hotel in Roa Roa, says Mr. Mandag, his disciples were there.
She says: ‘ As an elder in the field of disability, I have a sense of responsibility.
Gendon explained that, hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel laughing in the middle of the paragliding centre, he had sent the Whats App messages to the Palu race, which became part of the beach feast.
His orders, however, produce a single gray symbol, rather than blue strings.
"I think that means that the messages are not sent," he says.

The U.S. should increase support for A.I.
Since China is more active in the I.A., the U.S. should double the number in use of research in the field, say the developer and the AI, Kai- Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statements from after the different sides of the U.S. state have made an announcement to the AI, just as the general U.S. is not an organized plan for the AI.
During that time, China began its program last year: intended to have one.1 in AI in 2030.
"AI research budget will be a good start, just as all other countries are too far behind the U.S., and we want the next success for AI," says Lee.
Disagreement and funding may multiply the chances of a major AI achievement in the U.S., Lee tells the CNBC to discuss this week.
Lee, his book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Hart, the Director of the Signalition Ventures, which was planted in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face +.
In the 1980 ’ s in Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a new AI program that made the American Othello player quite public, and later the manager of Microsoft Research and the President of the China branch
Lee agreed to a former U.S. technical competition as the High Northern Pontiff of Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help see the following industries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to overcome government resources, says Lee.
"No China removes educational leaders; they are companies," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have used lights from university to operate on AI years later.
Lee said that the changes of the move goal can also help the U.S. to strengthen their AI efforts.
"I think blue cards should automatically be operated on the PhDs in AI," says.
The China Council has issued a development of the next General Intelligence Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation has released money from people at literacy centers such as the way the National Science Foundation and other financial resources are spent on researchers, but the work unit of the professionals is small in China, says Lee.
Early in the year. The Defense Department that replaced the Joint Trustal Intelligence Center, which must combine the administration of the area with the experts, and the White House announced the formation of a special body of the Artificial Intelligence.

The Macedonians have voted on Sunday to sign the name of the country into the "Re Republic of North Macedonia," an explosion that will resolve a conflict with the Greek country that is fighting the virtue of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its province, goes on to say that its neighbors in the north of their route are looking for their place and want to enter the NATO and EU.
Both governments make a contract with the name observed, but some say that changing the name means undermining the culture of most Macedonians and Slavic communities
President Gjoge Ivanov also would not vote and protesting the vote cast doubt on the arrival of 50 percent of the people until the case is legally established.
The question on the election paper reads: "You agree with the NNATO and EU membership on the Greek covenant."

"I came yesterday to vote for our country's sleek, so that the young Macedonians will be better off under the umbrella Union because it describes all our dying health," says Oliverra Georgijvska, 79, Skopje.
Or if not legally bound, enough members of the parliament have said that the vote will be accepted.
The change will take two thirds of its portion to feed on a parliamentary union.
The country’s polling commission said there were no reported reports against 1 p.m.
Yet, it was still 16 percent, with 34 percent of the previous election having been at parliament in 2016 when 66 percent of the votes were registered using their votes.
"I have gone out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, a lawyer in the city, Skopje.

"We have NATO and EU, but we want to join and set our heads, not by the service door" says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but are virtuous.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can convert others like China and Russia and become part of the European-Asigration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring the needed investment in Macedonia, with an average of more than 20 percent unemployed.
"I believe that the majority of our population will mourn with the EU and NATO," says Zaev after wearing the vote.

View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passing through the wall of all Brighton tombs to reach
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling laid down the Brighton wall in the Battle of Manchester City on 2-0 won on Saturdays at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very simple in his 65 - minute article.
The Argentinean guard is thrown into the stomach at the start of the preparation.
He has played a role among the three treasurers of Brighton, before crossing the stadium.
Aguero finds himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He snatched another guard before he passed another pile in the Brighton box.
Then he cries to the left, finding Stterling.
The front ear touched the ball in the box to bring it back to Aguero, who used his right bull to win the Brighton Matthew Ryan bit by the left-handed point on the left side of the net.
"Aguero still faces problems at his feet," City administrator Pep Guardiola tells the press.
"We're talking with her for 55 minutes, or 60 minutes.
That’s what has happened.
We've been fortunate to make the yoke in it for that moment.
But it was the Sterling that gave the Sky Blues a chance at the start of the Premire League cycle.
This truck will appear in the second of the 29th.
Aguero has found a ball in the turn of the Brighton players in that game.
You have sent a nice ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane said to contact it before leading Sterling toward the pole.
The Sky Blues guards touched the ball and entered the can and almost went out.
City competes with Hoffenheim in Champions League for a game that will be playing at 12:55 p.m. Rhein-Necker-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Schzer wants to play on scissors that are opposite. With Rockies
The National Group has been moved in a peach orff competition, no reason to force another start.
But a challenging Scherzer wishes to enter the stadium on Sunday and face Colorado Rockies, this may end up as soon as the Rockies meet up with problems in the plausoffs, still winning a single game by commanding Los Angeles Dodgers in the West and NL.
The Rockies still hold a single watch of the wild-card by a conquest by 52 when it has long faced the Nationals on Fridays, but they still look forward to holding their first fairion.
"If there is no play, it's still left that when it's reached the Denver station of its fans and the one team will be playing at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
What could make me not want to play there?
Nationals are not yet publishers to play on Sunday, but it sounds as if they can let Schcherzer enter the event.
Szcherzer, who may have entered for 34 years, had a bullpen clock on Thursday and will be on Sunday for his rest day.
This Washington right-handed operator has 2,53 and 220 strikeouts in 2/3 in this country.
Trump toil in West Virginia
The president removed his speech from a position surrounding his choice of Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when stressing the importance of the exodus of republics to the internal selection and leadership.
"All that we have done is on board by November.
Five weeks before the most important choice for our health.
This is one of the big ones, especially -- I don't run but can say that I am running because I am full of struggling for the best seats, according to him.
Trump has continued, "You see this terrible, horrible group of Democrats, the one you see now.
And they are willing to return to power in whatever way they can, just look at cruelty, and uncleanness.
They don't care who they are hurting, who should beat them to control and power, that's what they want to control and power, which they will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, are in the "results and disturbances."
"So when you look at the last four days," he says, calling Democrats "unto be angry, cruel, unclean and innocent.
He then refers to the Senate's Legal Committee that calls Sen. Democratic Fenstein by name, which drew water into the crowd.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you run the document anyway?
Ah, here I am!
No, no, I said that his single stand never told me good news — I have never seen a person’s stand so rich. ’
The Labor Group is no longer a congregation of anyone.
They no longer speak from their minds.
When Momentum seniors in my group threatened to close my mouth, I was not surprised at all.
But then, I have entered later a variety of MPs from a group of workers who have been told they are not welcome - simply because of the speech in our imaginations.
Our Parliamentary Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because of opposition to the Semitics.
In my case, those who wanted me to be banned accused me of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the matter of the importance of the budget considered, in national safety, in Europe, and in other surprises Jeremy has had an argument with other leaders before.
In the report of the Nottingham East staff for the Friday meeting, we say "We want meetings without prejudice and benefit."
For almost the whole year of my work force, the GC meetings for the Friday day have always been the same.
Sadly, too, it doesn't go as early as the day's conferences and the promise of the "primary" political promise has long been forgotten if, indeed, we have ever been present.
It is becoming increasingly evident that differing views are no longer allowed in the work force and that views are judged on the basis of which they are acceptable to the leaders of the group.
This begins shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, who I claimed to share similar political views, have also felt that I would compromise my stand - whether for national security or for a EU market.
Whenever I speak in public - it is no longer important and I am on the social network to get rid of a wave of sexual harassment, it destroys politics without warning, stating that I should not be part of the work force.
And I am not the only one who is experiencing this.
I know, however, that I was more fortunate than my fellows because the statements referred to me still prefer to be political.
I'm amazed that my colleagues still hold her in the service and their determination to be independent in the face of sexual or racial discrimination.
One of the most disturbing factors in this political age is the manner in which torture rates have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said that on the last week Labour priority should set limits.
The fact is, we no longer see this great church and have no confidence in itself or with the changing laws of cutting off the gang.
I have had much advice in the past two years being urged to deceive myself, not to talk too much and it will be "I'm ready."
But I was no longer involved in politics.
Since I had met Labour 32 years ago as a student, I was understandably upset by the government Thachher to leave the school bunk gutters, wanting to bring the best public services to those in need – perhaps as a local government or as a government minister.
I have never been politically neutral, including the last resort.
No one in Nottingham East would in any way be confused about the law of the mayor and the arguments on current leadership.
For those who have encouraged the voyage on Friday, all I can say is that when the world goes ahead in Brexit that will cost the owners, businesses and our public service, I do not wish to spend my time and energy honestly with the leader of the Labor Party.
Really, but one message I have is not from Nottingham Momentum, to mine, whether members of the Lavour or not: I deny myself by serving you and yet promise that there will be no threat or political activism to do what I believe will be best for all of you.
Leslie MP of Nottingham East
Ayr has 38-17 Melrose: Ayr has never been separated from the top
Two recent tries have dropped the final results, but Ayr is no doubt worthy of praise in this modern - day stage of Tennet's Premiership.

Morales' speech that promotes violence upsets the cooperation of the Chilean community, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will in time continue to have discussions, but it will be very difficult to continue reasoning after this.
Two countries have not changed one another since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, who represents Bolivia in Hague, has dismissed the suspicion that the court is too quick to decide.
Monday will give Bolivia "a unique chance to start a new partnership with Chile" as well as the opportunity "to establish a 139-year crisis for the benefits of both countries, and so say.
Calcutta also denies that Moroles – still one of the most famous Latin - American presidents of America – used maritime subjects as a political foundation.
"Bil Bolivia will never discard its proposal for use of the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is an opportunity to show that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says that stopping nuclear weapons will not occur unless they are able to trust America.
Foreign Ministry of North Korea R Yong Ho says that his country will not stop nuclear weapon first unless they trust Washington.
Ri has been speaking on Saturday at the conference of the United Nations.
He has appealed to America to follow its promises that he made at the Singapore conference that was among the rival leaders.
His observations until the time of America. The secretary of state Mike Pompio appears to be at the first point of the nuclear irresponsibility three months after the Singapore and Kim Jon Un Un, of North Korea.
Ri says it is an impossible dream that the continued vaccines and resistance of the U.S. concordats in Korea will make North Korea kneel.
Washington was well aware of his refusal to make announcements before Pyonging began to destroy his weapons.
Both Kim and the U.S. / American President Donald Trump needs a second conference.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyonging is willing to give up weapons that the world may view as the only way to avoid.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongy in the coming month for the second assembly of Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows many headwear coming into the stores near you
If you want to expand your hat list or simply block the sun completely from looking far away.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne display a list of large head hats on their left side of the SS19 in the Paris Fashion Week exhibition.
Unbelievable hats are filled in the Instaggrams this summer, and the sewers bring eyepieces.
The vivid of Valentino's hat was the long side of the ashtrayed feathers and bawel over the head of the model.
Some of the larger sizes include jewelry cups, a witch doctor’s hat.
Thomas Browne reveals unusual facial expressions during Halloween.
Most of the masks in the mouth look like Hannibal Lecter rather than the shape of the best designers.
Another structure, similar to underwater diving, contains air - conditioning material as well as mirrors.
If you persist in a fad or fashion that doesn’t appeal to you, you can put yourself in danger.
Cartons point out that large hats may be on their way to large shopping malls.
The giant helmet is soon followed by ‘La Bonba', a two-footed hat to open in this solar eclipse, which appears in Rihanna's "everonna" to Emily Ratajkowski.
The basic religious symbol of an abstract hat that is popular in the communications pages has sent other items to the exhibition - a sea bag about the size of a swimming suit shown by the circus.
The hot orange bag, made of rafia, was worn by the gannet, dressed in white skin on the handle, traveled alone on the Jacquemus's show' La Riviera SS19 in the fashion show in Paris.
The famous treasurer Luke Aritage told FEMAIL: ‘ I expect to see large hats and sea bags arrive at big stores in the next summer as the weavers have a major contributing factor, it will be difficult to forget the need to do things larger in scale.'
John Edward: Farm skills are important for residents on the continent.
The private schools in Scotland retain the details of good results, and this has continued in the year 2018 with other positive results, guaranteed only for personal achievement in sports, art, music, and other public endeavors.
With a staggering 30 thousand students in Scotland, the Scottish Council Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), they are heading towards bringing high-level assistance.
Independent schools aim to equip students to enter the highest academic standards, and to choose their assignments and places as citizens in the country.
As a educational agency that can organize and introduce a special educational program, we see modern farming operations continue to become popular and popular as a subject chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in the language you hear, what you say goes straight to his head."
When you talk to him in his tongue what you say comes to the heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot always trust English if we want to build relationships and trust with foreigners.
From the results of a survey of this year’s tests, we can see that the primary agriculture in the roof is being achieved in large numbers in private schools.
There were ninety-eight students in all of the students who learned the foreign languages received the High Class A.
Statistics, gathered in seventy-four ScIS schools, indicate that seventy-two percent of students have received a High class A in Mandarin, since another seventy-two percent learn German, sixty-nine percent of those who read French for six-three percent of those who read Spanish and who received A.
This indicates that foreign schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as valuable skills for children, and young people in the future will need them.
Farm now as a study in which you can choose, it is considered to be similar in academic and academic subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) at schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Commission for Employmony and Skills has found that 17 percent of the potential use of languages has been made by employers.
For the most part, language skills are becoming more important in preparing youths for employment opportunities.
With the many prospective tasks that I am making up languages, these skills are vital in a united world.
Whatever the case, if they are studying the second language, they put themselves in a better position to develop the same skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country puts a person with the ability to speak many languages in front of his contestants.
According to a UK study of more than 4 thousand UK adults (4,000) in 2013, seven-five percent (75) were unable to speak well in foreign territory and have good communication and French is the only one with two-rate numbers, fifteen percent.
That is why the raising of agricultural education is important for today’s children.
Having a lot of knowledge of your language, especially those of the developing world, will help to train your children for better employment.
In Scotland, school and school vary from one language to another.
Most of these schools focus on teaching older and more modern farming fields, and others teach crops that are considered the most important in the UK in terms of the year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child likes you, there are many types of agriculture you can choose from private schools, and keep the experts in the area.
Scottish private schools have committed themselves to providing a form of education to prepare the children for and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, this time the future holds.
No doubt at the present time, the international business community is saying that agriculture will continue to have an impact on the future of the world, so this must be shown in the field of education.
In fact, modern farming must be involved in "the skills of international communications."
The private schools will continue to offer this opportunity, variety, and attention to young Scottish people.
You have to do well.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

With the vote of the vote for the one to stop the high court, Trump aims to build followers in this medieval choice as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the synod on Sunday.
Trump's choice of West Virginia, when will it start?
Trump's election race in Wheeling, West Virginia will begin at seven o'clock in the evening. AT midnight, Saturday, 29 Early 2018.
You can view Trump's choice in West Virginia by entering YouTube and seeing what is happening now.
Trump may lead the church’s trial of the higher court, Brett Kavanaugh, charged with sexual charges by the prospective Senate vote as the FBI investigates.

The Ryder section 2018 The American team hopes to fight and keep the hopes available in Sunday games.
After a three - sided convention, on Saturday afternoon, these Ryder Cup games may have been four times more likely.
A weapon of absolute energy is the first - rate sports program, but the players believe in it, which can be compared.
Where, then, would they decide in terms of power now?
"They take the lead in six points and are now four, so we continue as if with a little power I think." says Jordan Spieth as they drive slowly in the day.
Europe has, indeed, four points ahead of twenty.
Americans, according to Spiegel, have little joy and much to be encouraged, not by the Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play together all day and have three to four points.
Spiegel has been dangerous and has taken the lead in an example.
Those watching him were very happy when he was, a patient golf course is essential for a game to fit in with Thomas himself.
His golf won the game by 15 with the same thrill, this kind gives him the conviction that the American team has not yet gone out.
" true you will have to dig deep and worry about your own game," says Spiegel.
There are now one of the remaining performers.
18 mines to mark them.
The only performer who has more tubers than Spieth and Thomas two days ago was these Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, not asked in the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but a very long and determined wedding.
"Moliwood" is the only hours that don't start the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but avoid the bogys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
This race, in the form of a dual force from this noisy crowd that they conclude will win on Sunday, and no other well - known athletes will be more eager to win the European as the sun falls on the Gulf National than on Fleetwood or Molinari.
The two mines are not exactly alike
The famed European has not changed, yet it does.
Bubb Watson and Web Simpson did little work Sergio Garcia, morning brethren, when Alex Noren was arrested.
Bogey and the other doubbles have left a long Spanard and Swede gap that they cannot find.
On Sunday, no one will help you get out of your mine.
Fourballs and folls are happy to watch closely because of close cooperation between maters, their advice, advice not to be taken seriously, and how the trick can soon change.
Europe has played well as a group and led to the end but has shown that the USA still has the power to continue, by choice, with skepticism.
Europe took 10-6 taking the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will be at the best tables on the last day the Ryder Cup after leaving the four hours and hours on Saturday 10-6 leading the United States.
Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won twice more than hard to pull Tiger Woods by four points Le Golf National.
On the European side of Thomas Bjorn, willing to swallow a cup that they lost in Hazel two years ago, a failure of America to the trash zone, put a 31 sequence.
The U.S. has had a hard time setting up the four hours, to win two games, but it will not just win the ball.
On the side Jim Furyk needs nine points in 12 Sunday games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European to win for himself a series of notes when he personally named Mollinari, after a good weekend a good week the players who won four points in their first play in the history of the Ryder Cup.
By cutting off Woods and Patrick Reed in the hours of the dayballs, they then coated the Woods and the American Redson Dechambau with 5.2.
Woods, entered the two Saturday games, showed great determination but now lost 19 of the 29 hours and hours respectively.
Justin Rose, sitting in the morning hours, went back to the tar Henrik Stenson in four hours at 2:1 to separate Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – third in the world.
And they are willing to return to power in whatever way they can, just look at cruelty, and uncleanness.
The Jordan Spieth and Justini are three times as good as crossing the Americans with three points on Saturday.
They gained 2.2.1 by crossing the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulters of Spain in the Fourfolds and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the four hours while they cut two open mines.
In History the Ryder Cup is only two having a team from four points to individual sports, on the other hand Furyk needs only measuring to protect the cup.
After doing better for two days, or so, the Sunday attacks seem to overwhelm them.
North Korea says that ‘ she cannot be armed without trust.
A North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continuing to increase dishonesty in the United States, and it is impossible for the world to release nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
R Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the world that North Korea had made "coventure" in the past year, such as nuclear determinant and nuclear testing, nuclear destruction, and a promise not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
He said, "Even so, we don't see a defense from the U.S."
"Without confidence the U.S. will have no hope of being protected in the world and under this condition there is no way that we don't equip ourselves first."
While It disagrees with North Korea's nomination in terms of the Washington's refusal of the nuclear dissection while North Korea may be rewarded by taking steps, the parliament is proving that we do not prevent nuclear annihilation as Pyongyngen did previously.
Ri refers to a statement set by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump for the first time meeting between president U.S. and North Korea's leader at Singapore on June 12, when Kim requested to work at "denoculation of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised protection for North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking to bring an end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States ordered Pyongyunge to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has always refused to release North Korea.
"U.S. insists on "the end of the first nuclear war" and raises the pressure levels of the law to achieve its objective by force, and to reject the "ad to end the war" says R.
"To understand that the law can humble us like a dream of people who don't care about us.
But the problem is that getting on the move increases our self - confidence.
Ri has not revealed the plans that there is a reunite between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader has presented to the United Nations from the kitchen.
The minister has mentioned at least three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Jae-in five months ago and added: "If part of this part of the urition is in South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of the Korean Peninsula will not cause this commitment."
Even so it is said that the sound of Ri was completely different last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly which looked up to the U.S. top and the North Korea's rockets rose after "Mu. Justice", Trump called Kim "rocketman" in this case.
This year the United Nations, Trump, who threatened ‘ by completely wiping out ’ North Korea, Kim's self-elevity and his non-arming courage to take action, but there is still much to do, and the law remains and remains until North Korea ends the nuclear epidemic.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have enough time for this, saying "If it takes two, three, or five years – it's OK."
Both Russia and Russia argued that the U.N. Security Council should have won Pyongy with the steps taken.
Even so, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told U.N. Security Council on Thursday: Security Council on Thursday: "The force of the Security Council must be very strong and invincible until we see the end, in full measure, and the evidence of nuclear extinction."
The Security Council has agreed to support North Korea in violation of the law since 2006 in establishing the purchase of nuclear goods and pyonggmic system.
Pompeo met Ri and with the U.N. General Assembly and said that after all we would visit again Pyongy in the next month to prepare for the second.
Pompeo has been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his final visit was not without its risks.
He left Pyongng in July which the progress was made, of North Korea only by publicly showing him "just being a criminal."
North Korea arranges an assembly with Moon this month to complete the site of emergency and nuclear mixture if the United States takes the "actual action."
She said that Kim told me of "the same measures" she wanted to strengthen safety when Trump promised in Singapore and caused a general social status with Washington.
Harvard college students help get enough sleep
Young Course at Harvard University this year all who have not yet retired sleep enough to overcome the habit of taking caffeine for the rest of the night.
The educational profession has found many students in advanced universities to be inadequate when it comes to basics that they can care for them.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has developed a course, the first of this type of U.S.
She was encouraged to start a service after giving a talk on how sleep is difficult for me to read.
At the end of it came a girl to me, saying, "Why am I told this now, in my middle school year?
He said that no one had told him about sleep – that amazed me,' he told the Telemogram.
Course is released for the first time of this year, explaining to students the importance of getting sufficient sleep habits and exercise, while improving daily well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and also director of the university's health care services, has decided that the university has decided to die a service after discovering that most students do not sleep at all during the week.
The length of the study includes a series of each step taken.
The first section is the picture of the school room, where students choose coffees, curtainers, instructors and books on the effects of caffeine and light play a role in sleeping.
In another half, half are told that avoiding long sleep increases the chances of heart disease, snow, thin, and cancer.
The compass map, with useful characteristics, will then encourage those involved to encourage them to think about their daily routine.
'We know that it will not change the conduct of the students' immediately.
We believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke tobacco, ’ adds Professor Czeisler.
Culture of ‘sociation ’ is the thing that is done, he says, adding that modern technology and excessive pressure on students reduces sleep levels that are a growing problem.
To ensure that you get sufficient sleep, sufficient enough, it must be the student's ‘ secret weapon to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, which means avoiding weight, as lack of sleep focuses on the state of hunger, making them go hungry.
Raymond Shuthi, a 19 - year - old student in California who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design a lesson, which he studied in one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He invited the study to open up and encouraged her to miss the study while it was at the center.
The next step, he hoped, was to ask the high school students to read in the same way as the reading program before joining the fine - competitive center.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students have to consider taking the alarm when they go to sleep, and that they will wake up, and understand the bad effect of ‘ blue light ’ produced by the electric light and the LED light, which can take you out of the spinal rhythm, leading to the speed of your feet.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mendga’s turn down Gerrard’s men
The Rangers were organized by a detective and left while at the surprise of Dolly Menga, who attacked Steven Gerrid’s co-toried case and failed 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrix has even intended to record their first victory since victory in St.
Try to attack in seven minutes before the half-time, while the Rangers's players endure without bending the horn.
As the Rangers now descend on the sixth point, Livingston glides in a third place and behind the Hibernian each other in either direction.
And it may be good to have a problem coming on the Ranges after you are in line with the calum Spence caught with the first aid after a fatal accident caused by something thrown away.
Gerard has made eight changes in the previous Ayr side to the Betfred Cup for finals.
Holt, on the other hand, accompanied the same Book 11 that took a point from the Hearts last week and would rejoice at the way your well - dressed clothes were getting off the air from his rivals on either side.
The Rangers may have held the ball heavily, but Livingston has done much with the ball they have found.
They would have gone in two minutes when Menga’s sleeping sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s article but the umpire lost a lot of opportunity in the park.
Keaghan Jacobs's freeboard got Craig Halkettoy-sipper but his mate's friend Alan Lithlogow has long since.
Rangers have been able to control but have placed more confidence in their play in the last third stage of the game.
Alfreddo Morelos has felt as though he had to get a penitentiary when against Steve Lawlesses, but his friend Steven Thomson has dismissed the Colombian application.
The Rangers are able to place two points in the first half facing the wheel, but the Ibrex's older band Liam Kelly is not worried about the rassana Coulibaly's head and the debased attack by Ovie Ejaria.
By the time Libi failed to open up within 34 minutes of the event, no one could deny that they were appropriate according to their performance.
The Rangers also failed to resist Jacobs soccer.
Scott Arfield did little when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson, the one who had dared to do so easily to Menga.
Gerrdube and move after a break while changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and this change likely contributed quickly to the knocker’s knocking on Morelos but Kelly, who is fascinated, runs out of his line to stop it.
But Livingston goes on to describe the spectators who play their favorite sport, as well as Lithgow and Halket sweeping the long balls behind the other footprints.
Holt’s side could open the gap in the final stages, but McGregor stood up and forbade Jacobbs before Lithgow hit a ball in the corner.
Rangers Middleton’s successor, Glenn Middleton, has long found the piano at the time of Jacob’s argument with Jacobs, but at the same time, Thomson’s side is on the other side.
Almanac: Geiger Counterator
And And now our “San Sunday morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, some 136 years ago, and B.C.E. ... the day that Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a system for finding and measuring radioactivity, which led to a flurry of activity only the Geiger County.
The scientific base since then, the Geiger Counterer that became the spinal back of the papal pole, as in the 1950 falls "Balls of Coronado" in which the statements of scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What could that be?
Rogers: "The Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive nearals, such as uranium.
While inserting open earphones, you may be able to detect radioactivity from minerals.
Evans: "Tell me, they're up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before he celebrated 63 years.
But this invention bears his name forever.
A new cancer goal can teach the immune system to ‘ see ’ the wrong cells
A new cancer goal can teach the immune system to ‘ see ’ the wrong cells and kill them
The goal is to teach the immune system ‘ to see ’ the wrong cells as a treatment program
The procedure involves taking the patient’s immune cells, which are replaced by the laboratory.
'Not seeing' normal protein in many cancers and then rejected
The goal of coloring shows promising results to patients with cancer types.
A woman treated for the purpose, who teaches the immune system to see the wrong cells, saw the cervical cancer vanish within 18 months.
This method involves taking protective cells from the patient, converted to "see" normal protein in a large cancer called HER2, and then reinvasing the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a promising goal."
HER2 "pronounces the growth of types of cancer," including breast, womb, lung, and other cancers, explains Prof Bertofsky.
The same way to take protective cells from patients and teach them" is to understand how you understand the cancer cells that have done well in treating some form of leukemia.
And West was in the thought of putting Trump on a hat of MGA, after he had appeared in a sack of an ox.
Misplacement
Once West was praised in the Saturday Right Live after singing praises to American President Donald Trump and said that he would take the choice in 2020.
After singing his third night song, named Grost Town when he wore a cap written by Mike America Great, he was starting to make noise with the Democrats and made sure to install Trump.
"I often talk to a white person and say, 'How can you love Trump, you are prejudiced against them?'
If I were concerned about prejudice, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started running on the Matt Damon chapter when a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanough’s testimony before the General Justice Committee for sexual offenses made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite the distribution, this Western noisy session was put on the lines of communication by humor Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock was trying to ridicule West in writing.
And West complains to the audience that they have had a hard time on the back of the stage with my head on it.
"They have knocked me over the back of the platform.
They said, ‘ Don't be there with that hat.'
They beat me!
They also said I was a hole in the gates," he said, according to the Washington Investig.
West continued: "Do you want to see a place in the streets?" meaning "He can wear his superman cap, for it means that he will not tell him what to do. You want the world to go on?
Try love.
Not long ago, they were doubled by the eyes and the SNL team's shy record, the Viety reported, one telling the printers: "Study was quiet."
West was installed with the band of a musician Ariana Grande in time, her old boyfriend, Rapper Miller died a few days ago.
West ordered many by singing I Love ist, played as a Perrier Bottle.
West has been adopted by the head of the former MPSA, Candace Turner, who put in the Tutter, and said: "A spirit of tremendous courage: WE SUFFICK TO BEWARGET AND WIND.".
But the manager of a conversation program, Karen Hunter, wrote in Twitter, said that West "You steal this person isn't sitting that one and just that's good."
"But I choose not to please anyone (by buying his music or his dress or setting up his "art") which I believe is built up and filled with a dangerous sense in society.
He is free.
So it is," he adds.
Before the presentation, a Rapper happened to Twitter to change his name, saying that he is now going to be called "Sena West".
He is not the first singer to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Peddy.
A parapper, Snoop Dogg, once called Snoop Lion, and indeed the dead musician Prince, changed his name with a sign and was named Prince.

HIV/ADs: China reported 14% forward to new circumstances
China announces a 14% increase in the number of people who live with AIDS and are exposed to the virus.
More than 82,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases are reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases came.

In view of life - styles, studies have shown that 70% of men who have sex with other men have ended up marrying women.
Much of the outbreak of disease results from the improper use of sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to bring the world to the brink of disasters as an effort to cope with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that some work has obscured the information of GAP sotors', explosioning a ‘ dangerous lie' with 'pockets' and 'pockets'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters has published the suspicion that one of his employees inserts a 3 in the Republic of the U.S. government page on Wipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrats explained that the charges were spread by an expert "Beultra-right working" and on the Internet.
"A lie, a lie, and many other gross lies," says Waters in the Twitter statements.
The missing detail includes home addresses and numbers of U.S. Sens. Linsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both in Utah.
Information comes from the Internet on Thursday, installed in Capitol Hill while the Sanate sub-constitutional suspected of sexual misconduct in the Super Court Brett Kavanough.
This jump occurs after Kavanough has three secondary questions.
Old computers, such as Gateway Pinit and Redstate, reported that IP addresses indicate that Waters office is related to it and that it is the actual name of the Waters work, reports the Hill.
"These unconfirmed charges are false and false," continues Waters.
"The good of my-owners, the personal part of the person, and the safety of the vulnerable as a result of false and false accusations of fraud – has not been involved with the plundering of the details.
These bases are really false and are not true.
Waters ’ statements quickly become critical in the Internet, including the White Housepress secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"The deny can be exhausted," wrote Fleischer.
"This means that he doesn't have the meekness of the Members of Congress.
If someone is criticized for something they have not done, they should not be discouraged.
They should not hesitate.
They are not to blame for the prosecutor’s intentions.
They must be cool and peaceful.
Fleischer seems to liken Waters' answer to criticism by Democrat Judge Kavanaugh, who was reproved by critics who were particularly tired of the trial on Thursday.

"Most certainly if true," wrote to the Twitter.
In his commission, Waters said his office to inform the "Using officers and the legislature of these frauds.
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," he continues, "and they will be charged with all their acts of destruction and of danger to any or all of my personnel.
The theory of Johnny English Strikes Against – lowers the spy poof of Rowan Atkinson
It is a custom now to consider the importance of Brexit to any end of a British film and that it does not appear to carry with the resurrection of the Johnny English game, which began long ago with Johnny English and was restored in 2011 by the Johnny English Reborn.
Eating hot potatoes as indicated in the article that we could have a new opportunity to sell outdoors?
At any rate, the open eye, the faces of Johnny English’s tracker who held authority for the second time – that name is a big joke designed for English - speaking movies.
You are indeed an unobtrusive spy organization that exceeds even his unusual masks to the splendors of Clousau, the Sir Bean's, and his strength from the Chariots of Fire in the London 2012 Olympic festival.
And it comes from the mysterious traveler and man Atkinson who passed through the current advertisements and became corrupt on the Barclaycard TV, who has left confusion in his wake.
There are other and two times of these present visits to JE.
I like Johnny English to climb a helicopter while he has broken an old military suit and small swords hanging on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of comics is a display, but the humor looks like a low and highly exaggerated one, especially in the production of the "deep" films as well as for the Massion Amossible itself now providing the laughs as a substance.
Humiliation for us is higher than for adults, and to me Johnny English’s journey is undamaged and unexploded and focused on a sound film of Atkinson’s noise and personality.
The story now on the horizon is that Great Britain is in the thicket.
The Cyber-hacker goes into the British observatory, producing a detail of British fleets in the field, which is of concern to the project – that is a small task to Kevin Eldon.
The last minute in the prime minister you carry is a powder, which is faced with a failure in the political community: Emma Thompson is trying hard to imitate Teresa-May but there is nothing in the text he may disagree with.
His spies informed him that all the spies had to find someone who was beyond the nose.
This means that Johnny English itself, now as a cholmaster in an expensive place, but gives un recorded lessons on how he is an explorer: the humors are, since England provides the study of exploration at the Rock-type Academy.
Englided to Whitehall to be given urgent commands and joined by kindly Bogh, Ben Miller again.
Bough is still a married man, associated with submarinecommander, a pleasant place to play by Vicki Peppedine.
So Batman and Robin, to make things really clear in the Secret Service of the Back Lady, meet Olga Kurylenko's being autifide frame Ophelia Bulletin.
There, munister is rapidly sinking into the world of millions who say he can solve computer problems: the Sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Rayy.
English and Bough began their strange journey: hiding like a waiter, starting a fire at a French restaurant; starting a problem with a Volta boat; and England, which removed the mystery when they learned to use the Volt's Virtual Real Headset to test the house.
All efforts are made to improve the last session or to be friendly and enthusiastic, rather than the children’s TV on everything.
He has truly stood up for them.
And like some of Johnny English films I couldn’t control myself: the British film industry could not provide a place to show his talent to everyone?
Labour denies that they are planning for Britons to work four days but pay five days
Jeremy Corbyn's group of Obour imagines a marvelous plan to see Britos working for four - but paid five targets.
The team has reported that they want company management to pass on the profit derived from the Aritificial Intelligence (AI) to the staff by giving them an extra day.
The workers seem to enjoy three days of the week – but pay the same amount.
The sources say that this view would fit the economic purpose of the group and the program to convert the nation to workers.
Change in four days is approved by the Trade Union Congress as a means of taking the chance of changing the economy.
The source of the elderly Liverity told The Sunday Times: ‘ The police test is expected to be done before the end of the year.
'Not at night but on four days in church but four days' is not the object of a group recognising the economy's means of recognising the crew and the whole idea of the field.'
The Labour Party will not be the first to recommend a plan, and the Green Party that binds them for four working days during the 2017 design design for it.
The whole Labour Party has not yet been set up, however.
Commenting on Labour Party, he said: 'Work for four days is not a company police force and is never thought of by the group.'
Shaw Chancellor John McDonnell used the previous church conference of Labour to express his opinion on the socialism revolution in the economy.
Mz McDonnell has said that she is willing to lie down and the power returned to ‘ the unknown guides' and ‘wrights' in the firm firms.
The scheme also the Shadow chancillor also explains that the harreholders in the water companies may not get the whole scale as the Labour government did ‘ draw in the wrong way.
He also made sure to install personnel on company boards and on the Infsulowve Wineship Funds to give 10 percent of the per cent of prime-stort frames to the staff, who will afford a minimum yearly income of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, said "60 Minutes" that FBI research on Kavanauaugh could change their minds.
Research on the FBI's charges on judge Brett Kavansaugh postponed the election of the Supreme Court last week, and raise questions that the findings of the detectives can change the way the commissioners of Republican influence their followers.
In a recorded Sunday conversation, "60 minutestes" the interview host Scott Pelley asked the Republicans. John Kennedy and Lindey Graham or FBI should find something to change their minds.
Kennedy appears to be more comfortable than his peers in South Carolina.
"I'll say, yes," says Kennedy.
"I went to the corner, and we, having also spoken to the judge Kavanough.
Call me after doing this, the charges are gone out, and I said, 'Have you done it?'
He has been stubborn, slow and decisive.
Graham’s knife, however, appears to have been set.
"My mind has decided on Brett Kavanough and will take strong suspicions," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happens, but I know this: Brett immediately rejected," adds Graham, explaining on Christine Blasey Ford.
"Then all who mourn didn't confirm this.
It has been 36 years.
I see nothing changing.
What has the Global Citizen Festival and Have Try to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will deal with the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event with a list of top players who will play with the same goal; to rid the world of poverty.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host the clouds of people entering a large courtyard in Central Park not only to please the Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but to make a real wake with the real intention of ending poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is a conglomeration of the Global Poverty Project, a world group that strives to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it.
To get a party ticket (excepting that you would like to pay for VIP tickets), cookies had to do something like "occupiers", send an e-mail to the world leader, call or do something deeper to help you lose your sleep by ending poverty.
How successful has the Global Citizen been in the 12 years remaining to reach its goal?
Is the idea of getting people on a free concert the right way to try people to do something, or what else is called "Cicktivism" – people who feel they are making a difference by signing a list on a computer or sending a list to a train?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has recorded the "acts" of more than 19 million fans, short of handling different objectives.
It says that we have helped to slow down earth’s oarsmen in calming the movements and goals of over $37 billion to affect the health of 2.25 billion in 2030.
In 2018 you begin, the team has picked up 390 views and expressions since their actions, about $10 removed or tried to collect them.
The team estimates that income has directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Another commitment involves The Power of Nutrition, U.K. team manufacturers and inventors devoted to "helping children properly," promised to provide Rwanda $335 million to help eliminate the famine in the country after obtaining 4,700 of these from the Global Citizens.
"In the establishment of the UK government, the donors, national governments, and the Global Citizens like you, we can try to make a history of malnutrition due to a lack of public repair," The Power of Nutrition an Ambassor Trade Ullman has found a mass in London conference in April 2018.
The team also said that after more than 5,000 years to call the U.K. better better food for mothers and children, the government has announced the support of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach up to 5 million women and children through nutritional means.
In answer to some FAQs in their website asking "What do you think we can do to eliminate extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult way – sometimes it will fall and fail.
However, as public rights and as anti-partheid demonstrations before us, we will win, for we are very strong together.

US should be used by the Navy to "block" to prevent the export of Russian escalation - Internal Security
Washington "if necessary" can use the Nambas to stop the Russian exports of the Energy, including the Middle East, the Internal Secret Ryan All revealed, by the Washington Examiner.
All said that Russia and Syria are clearly linked, when it works with the official government registration – it is the way to try some new electrical markets.
"I believe in the reason that in the Middle East they want to obtain the output as in Eastern Europe, and in central central and central Europe," reports.
Also, according to the worker, there are ways to repair it.
"The United States is able, by means of our army, to ensure that seaways are opened and, if necessary, shut up, to ensure that their power does not go to the market," he says.
Zinke has been talking to those present at the feast conducted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself "the voice of power user" in the U.S.
He also compared Washington’s efforts to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that the results are the same.
"Selecting the trade with Iran and Russia, to some extent, is a way of gaining and obtaining oil," he says, while speaking of Russia as a "rogue horse" and having a economy that depends on oil residues.
These statements appear as Trump’s office attempts to encourage the transfer of their natural fluid into Europe, to replace Russia, the most cheapest route for European consumers.
As a result, officials of the Trump office, including the U.S. president Donald Trump himself, are trying to encourage Germany to get out of the Nord Stream branch project 2 "not fit", according to Trump, which made the Berlin "down" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 of the Northern Stream pipes are $111 billion, arranged to double the size of the existing pipes as much as 70 feet [110 m] high, are certainly an economic project.
Kremlin says that Washington's opposition to the project invariably comes from economic reasons and is an example of an unfair competition.
‘ I believe we have the same view that power cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose from whom to buy," says Russian Minister Aleksandr Nova after the meeting with U.S. Secretary of Power Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused Germany to withdraw, which has renewed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told the US to withdraw from the EU energy policy and contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third world interrupts our movement," says Dieter Kempf, the director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the recent conference between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "You’ll look around" Entering the Presidential Option20, says the Massachusetts Senator
The General of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that on Saturday it would "look around" to interfere with the choice of becoming president after mid-time choice.
During a convention at a city hall in Hotele, Massachusetts, Warren has made sure that he will consider joining the choice.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and set up our corrupt government which includes a woman who will be a leader," he says, in accordance with The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take a closer look at the choice of becoming president."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during a city hall meeting, saying "You have been talking to the people who are misleading them.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to my people," he says.
Warren spoke openly against Trump and the choice of the High Court for Brett Kavanough.
In what he wrote to Tweeter on Friday, Warren said "certainly we need a FBI investigation before voting."
A report published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's followers do not think they should enter the choice in 2020.
50 percent of the Massachusetts people say that senator should not take over, according to statistics received from the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe.
32 percent have supported it to be sufficient.
Statistics have shown further support that former Emperor Deval Patrick is suitable for the choice, 38 percent say they are not good enough, and 48 percent say that they are not good enough.
Other names of the Democratic periods of higher professors who may have entered the 2020th vote include the former vice president of Joe Biden and the Sanator of Vermont Sernie Sanders.
Biden has said that you will decide on January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks of Track Panian’s PTSD at a Dalald Trump conference
Track Palin, 26 years old, has spent a whole year in Iraq after being drafted with the Sept.
He was arrested and accused of violence in the family on Monday night
"I can see how my son faces, what he has experienced after his return, how other families are coping with the side effects of PTSD and other injuries our soldiers have brought back with," he tells the audience at the Dalld Trump convention in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Salin has called his arrest "an elephant in the ward" and said of his son and other war warriors, "they are also different persons, and are strengthened, and wonder whether there is any respect for what they are of the military and Air Forces, and for all the rest of the soldiers, to do for their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Yasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence for beating a woman, disrupting the domestic violence and drinking time, according to Dan Bennett, the spokesman for the War of the Wallilla Police.
18 stations, D.C., support the new security strategy
The 18 states and the District of Columbia support a new legal effort to have a new U.S. program that prohibits protection from gang or home violence.
Representatives of the 18 provinces and the province have sent a commission to the witnesses on Friday in Washington to support a person in need of protection against this goal, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Speechs which the American Civil Liberities Union has installed in August against the state goal has not yet been revealed.
He said that his collaborators and his violent gang members abused him, but the U.S. officials did not accept his request for protection on July 20.
She has been settled in Texas.
Department of State spoke of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produces a large number of people who have requests for U.S. protection, as nations that are facing serious problems with criminals and domestic violence.
The new U.S. program of protection reversed the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed unsubstantial migrants to escape domestic violence to gain protection.
The Attorney General of Columbia State, Karl Racine said in his words on Friday the new policy "not heeding decades of the rule of state and international law."
"The rule says that all requests for protection must be judged by the facts of each request, and making a decision like this is a violation of that law," says the court-ward witness.
The attorneys also pointed out that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering is damaging the U.S. economy, saying that they may become businessmen and ‘ create employment opportunities. ’
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions has advised immigration judges not to protect people from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"People can be protected if they leave their country because of persecution or terror because of race, religion, nationality, or being a member of a certain group or political opinion," says the Sessions in his declaration on June 11.
Protection was not intended to solve all problems -- even all the major problems that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Great efforts are being made in Palu as the number of deaths repeated in attempts to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is gloomy.
"It's really a crisis," says 35-year-old Mama Risa Kusuu, who comforts her son in a center for those who have escaped from the city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance brings dead bodies.
We don't have clean water.
The inhabitants seem to be returning to their devastated homes, looking for their goods in plenty of water, trying to find whatever they can.
Hundreds of people are also injured in hospitals, damaged by 7.5 quakes, were full of dead.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken the spine and shoulder, have been seated outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients are treated outside because of an ongoing earthquake.
Tears welled up in her eyes as she remembered the commotion in the room of the fifth - floor hotel where her wife and daughter lived.
"There was no time to look for a way to escape.
I was depressed over broken walls, I think to myself," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city of marriage.
"When my wife heard me crying for help, I was again relieved.
I don't know what has happened to her and to my child.
I hope they are alive.
A U.S. ambassador falsely accuses China' of 'profane advertising'
After a week the Chinese official newspaper has had a four-page advertisement for U.S. goods for both U.S. and China, a U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using an American newspaper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke of China's Chinese Daily assets in Des Moines Register - the Iowa newspaper, which is purchased - after sued China for joining in the election case of Nov. 6 in the U.S., which China rejects.
The Trump charge that Beijing was trying to fit into the U.S. election created what U.S. officials said Reuters is a new category in the Washington stress campaign.
Although foreign governments are often to advertise for trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing commercial war that has resulted in an ever-exploited exchange of revenues.
China’s demand for money at the start of the trade war was intended to depose import migrants to places such as Iowa to support the Trump Republican Party, says researchers from China and the U.S.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who sends many agricultural goods to China, has Beijing wounded American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in the Sunday article Des Moines Register, "two times more of this harassment by making false claims in our free press."
"In a province which has been spread, the Chinese government has made itself available in a popular American custom of freedom of speech and a free newspaper by presenting an award to Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"In contrast, in the street market of Beijing, there are few exceptions to you, and you will not see the true reaction of the various Chinese attitudes that may be affected by the economic effects of China's economic crisis, if the news is thought to be viewed by the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He has added that "one of the best newspapers in China has escaped the chance to publish" his story, although he did not say which of that newspaper.
Republicans Kill Women Before the Middle Choice and the Age because of Kavanaugh’s Failure, Warns Observers
Since many of the high Republicans are waiting and protecting the chance of being brought to the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh at several charges of abuse, analysts warn them that the wood will return with the driver, especially on the platform, during the medieval and future period.
High lungs in this regard, and many Republicans are already proving that they wanted to continue with the election.
Those things will no longer be reversed," Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Syracuse University's Maxwell School tells The Hill in a printed article on Saturday.
Reeher expressed skepticism that the last attempts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizo) to investigate would suffice to cause angry votes to lower the lungs.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - will not forget tomorrow and November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a red counselor and international spokesman for the developing Moveon group on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters announced, "Come November!" as they were active in the Senate hall as the Republicans control the Judith Committee prefer to continue and select Kavanaugh despite the evidence presented by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports the Mic.
"Democratism and enthusiasm will be virtually eradicated," says Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst, telling the press.
"People say it's already hot; that's true.
But it can still be higher, especially among women's voters in cities and young voters, 18-to 29 years of age, which, while not in favor of the president, are seldom voted.
Even before Ford’s evidence, which contains details of his alleged abuse charges against the chance of being brought into the Supreme Court, analysts say that the fire can come back with the applicant if the Republic continue to prove it.
"This is now the GAP damage," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republic National Committee, at the beginning of the previous week, according to NBC News.
"It's just about the last committee vote or that Kavanaugh is placed on the bench, in connection with how the Republicans handle this and how he treated him," says Guy Cecil, director of the Proorities USA, a group that helps people choose Democrats, informing the press station.
The Americans, however, seem to be divided by whom they believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and are inclined to take the Kavanoughs.
New figures from You Gov show that 41 percent of the people certainly or to some extent do not believe in Ford evidence, while 35 percent say that they are sure or at least believe Kavanough's.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanough was definitely or to some extent lying in the evidence he gave, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressed by Flake, the FBI currently investigates the charges brought by Ford and at least one accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford spoke before the Senate Justice Committee the previous week, saying that Kavanough had abused him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez says that the defendant in the Supreme Court revealed his private parts and showed him at a party during your study period in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Innovated Start With Google and Facebook
Tim Berners- Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, starts a program to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
A new technology project, Inrupt, is a company built from the opening platform of the Berners-Le Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and the information people are allowed to reach.
In a unique conversation with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the aim of Inrupt is "the possession of the world."
"We must do it now," says this work.
"It's a history."
This App uses Solid technology to allow people to create a "Personal online data" or POD archive.
It can contain a list of people, what to do, a calendar, a music library, and other human and material.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify all available in one brush and at the same time.
What is significant about a POD store is that it depends on the user who can obtain any kind of information.
The company calls it "the net that gives you power."
The idea of the Inrupt, in accordance with the CEO of the company John Bruce, is that the company brings inrso, Prophesys and the skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
This company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM security platform, non-creasing staff for the project, as well as many volunteer co-conserors.
Since this week, the founders of technology around the world may set up their Apps using the tools available to the Inrupt unit.
Berners-Lee said he and his group talk and "Facebook and Google as to whether or not they should be brought about a complete change in which all their business will change completely.
"We don't request their permission.
In one post in a printed Media on Saturday, Bernard-Lee writes that Inrupt "des to provide the power for trade and operating systems that will help to protect the integrity and the confidence of the new web package built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners- Lee converted the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners- Lee has led a discussion of neutrality.
Even with the publication of Inrupt, Bernard-Lee will still be the founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consertium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am looking forward to the beginning of the coming term of the web," adding Berners- Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commended by a clergyman who received Victoria Cross of WW1
The only pastor of the Church of England to win Victoria Cross during World War I has been hailed in his city after 100 years.
Lt Col Preacher Bernard Vann received a prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellingise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later and could not find out that he had won the biggest prize in the British army.
A monument opened by two of his grandsons at the time of the Rushden, Northamptonshire, was opened on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, has been "a good sign" that the stone was opened directly in the year 100 since his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London Gazette, in September 29, 1918 Lt Col Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a fog which shots and guns and guns."
He later rushed into the firing section and "with great courage" took the lead before running with a gun and killed three soldiers.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German gunman on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, aged 72, says that his grandfather's actions are “something I don't know I could do but something to respect him.
He and his brother Dr James Vann set flowers behind the clock, led by the Brentop Imperial Youth Bank.
Michael Vann said that "he felt he had the great privilege of having a part in the clock" and said that "the real strength of the real force is shown by the support that most people will give."
MMA followers spent the whole night watching Bellator 206, but they got Pappa Pig
Imagine, you stay overnight to watch Bellator 206 and be forbidden to watch the event.
The San Jose festival had 13 games, including six on the main card and was displayed all night in the UK for Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rary MacDonald were ready to fight, UK observers were left astounded when the station changed to Peppa Pig.
Some have been uncomfortable after waiting all night until dawn, especially at sunrise, at the end of the race.
One successor in Twitter described this change in children's animation as a "unexpected laugh."
"It is a government policy that in 6 a.m. this competition was not appropriate and therefore had to be changed to the format of the children," says Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator for marketing and communications, when asked about this change of order.
"Upepa the pig," yes.
The president of the Bellator company Scott Coker said they would look closely at their termites in order to include UK observers in the future.
"I think if I think to play it again, I think we can try to play it," says Corer.
"But it is six o'clock on Sunday there, and we can't correct this until Sunday by our time, Monday in their time.
But we are on top of it.
I tell you, at the turn of time, there were so many messages sent to each other that they were not all pleasant.
To help them fix it, we thought it was a technological problem.
But it was not, it was a matter of government.
I promise that it will never happen again.
We’ll keep five events six - as we often do and try to please our followers and go to extremes.
If it was an undesirable situation.
Desert Island Disasters: Tom Daley feels ‘ discriminated out ’ because of his sex
Olympic winner Tom Daley claims that he has grown up isolated because of his sex - but that has given him the incentive to succeed.
This 24-year-old winner who didn't realize went to high school to say "No one likes me."
Regarding the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disasters published by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned homosexual rights to give to others "hope."
He also said that if a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
A regular program player, Kirsty Young, has been inactive for months because of illness.
From a person abandoned in the first Laverne program, Dayley has felt that he was "left out" by everyone as he grew up because it was not acceptable to love boys and girls.
He said: ‘ To this day, those feelings of worthlessness, isolation, and positive feelings have given me the strength and the strength to succeed. ’
She wanted to show that she herself was a "man," she said, so that she would not disappoint everyone when it was finally discovered that she was a homosexual.
The winner who won the Olympic championship twice is a senior disavocational professor who has signed the LGBT and used his position at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge other countries not to consider it wrong to practice homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt fortunate to be able to live a life free of problems and want to give others "hope."
This winner who won three world championships has fallen in love with a man - the US movie producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "I'm not expected."
Daley married the man who was awarded the Oscar prize, which he left over 20 years ago but who said the same number of years has never been a problem.
"When you face so much in life at such an early age" - you go to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - you found it difficult to find an equal person who had experienced similar circumstances.
The two received a baby by June, a son whom they named Robert Ray Black-Galey, and Dayy has said that "her opinion" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was concerning 'I want to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things far more valuable than the gold rings of the Olympic.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
Her son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dailey says that his father refused to accept his death, and one of the last things he had asked for was London 2012 - as he intended.
"I couldn't say 'I won't be able to attend those games'," he said.
"I would hold her in my hand when she breathed the last and until she breathed the last and died when I saw that she was also a person like us," he said.
The following year Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and received a bronze medal.
"I could see that this was what I had been looking for all my life - swimming before my people in the Olympic Games, and that there was nothing better than that," he said.
It also made him choose his favorite song — Heather Small - who has been nervous during the time of preparation for the Olympics and still stimulates him.
The Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is sitting on a bench on the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Pil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47 Ryder Cup game, but he will have to climb socks so as not to make a sad record.
Mickelson, who will be playing in this typical event for two years for 12 years, is seated on a bench by the captain Jim Furyk in the Saturday hours and hourssomes.
Instead of taking the lead, as he often does in playing the United States, this fifth winner splits the day into a championship and worked on his game in hopes of finding his cause.
Not a good person who plays soccer even after a period of time in this game, this 48 - year - old player is not qualified for the death of the Le Golf National game, where the average playing is usually a problem if you play a distant ball.
And if the playing area is not so much a problem, Mickelson, who will be playing the ninth drama Sunday, will meet Francesco Molinari, an expert in the British Open, who was playing with the red Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If these Americans, who have lost 4 points in 12 games of one player, start well, Mickelson's game can be a decisive one.
Furyk has expressed his trust in his fellowman, and he has not said anything else.
"He fully understood his present role, held me on my back with his arm and said he would be ready for the next day," says Furyk.
"You are very confident.
He is a famous athlete, and he has much to do in the past, including this reporter.
I probably never imagined him playing two games.
I expected more, but that is what happened and that is what we thought we should do.
You want to play, like everyone else.
Mickelson will record last time Nick Faldo in the number of games he has played on Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It may be his last match for the Ryder Cup that never matches what he has achieved as a player.
Mickelson has won 18 times, has been eaten 20 times and has played the same games, although Fulyk says his presence has improved the group.
"It's good to be with her, to have fun, to laugh, to make fun of people, and to be a pleasant person to be with her in the gang room," she has explained.
"I think young players have enjoyed having him, and, on this weekend, it has been good to see you.
He does much more than just play.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that taking the lead with many points does not matter
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows that leading with many points on the last day of the rafts to the Ryder Cup can easily change into a hard game.
Dane played for the first time in the 1997 drama in Valderma, when the team with the captain of the Sve Balleros led five points over the Americans but was finally ahead of the same point, winning by 141–213.2.
"Keep reminding yourself that we were taking the lead with many points in Valderma; we led by many points in Brookline, where we were eaten, and in Valderma, where we won, but with a few points," says Bjorn, in the photograph, after viewing the Kulasi of 2018, it won at 5-3 on Friday and last to take the lead at 10-6 Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in that group that you have not yet ended.
Do your best in the future.
Take care of them and do all you can in the right way.
It’s not until you reach that point.
We have the goal, and we are trying to take that cup, and that is what we focus on.
I have already said this, focusing on the 12 performers in our team, but we know exactly what is true of that group - the world's largest players.
Thrilled with the way his players play in a difficult game, Bjorn has added: ‘ I will never reach my conclusions about this.
The next day’s game is different.
In the future each player will decide how to play, and that is different.
It is good to go out and play with a person when things are going well, but if you do play alone, then you are thoroughly trained as a golf player.
That is the message you need to impart to the athletes, that you do all you can tomorrow.
Now, she leaves the player with her behind and must go and do all she can.
Unlike Bjorn, his rival Jim Furryk will have seen that his players are playing better by themselves than by themselves, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, to get three points from four.
Furyk himself is able both to eat and to win on the last day at the last minute, as he once became part of a winner team at Brookline before being eaten when Europe was "tried by miracles in Medinah."
‘ I remember well," he says always in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, urged his players on the final day of the game.
"We have 12 important games in the morning, but it would be good to start with the top gear as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When that incentive and enthusiasm persist, he puts the focus of his attention on the game itself.
We organized our players in harmony with that and put our players in the way we think, it will enable us to perform magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to take the lead in fighting and returning from the game and facing Rory McIlroy in the top sport, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter in the upper paragraph.
"I'm going with this group that stands this way because I think it's going to be ready for the whole game," says Bjorn for the selected players.
The German battleship has been launched again
A new version of the German Navy industry known as frigate was to begin operating in 2014 to replace the old Corra-era ships, but it will not be there until at least next year because of the system and the cost of Snowball, reports the local news.
The commission of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the head of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, is now postponed in the early part of 1990, says the Die Zeit the newspaper quoted military statements.
The ship was supposed to join Navy in 2014, but the problems following the holiday swept through the future of a determined project.
The four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg-clas that were the exception of the Navy long ago in 2007 are to replace the Bremen-class ships.
It is understandable that ships will have powerful guns, types of guns that explode antiaircraft bombs and ships and hidden technology, such as space missing, infrared, and noise signals.
Other important items included long periods of care — it is impossible to use new ships until two years later at the ship’s destination.
However, further confusion means that the vital development of warships - will give Germany power abroad - it will be out of place when it goes into operation, says Die Zeit.
A ship with the future death of F125 appeared on paper last year, when Germany Navy refused to use the ship and returned it to Blohmbna-Voss to the port of Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship where it was built after being brought.
Little is known about the reasons for the ship's reship, but German news media said that there was much important problem with the software and the hardware's condition, making a warship useless if sent to war.
Software problems have been especially important as the ship Baden-Wuerttemberg-clas will be used by a crew of 120-mandules - part of the adult Bremenclas.
It also appeared that the ship is too heavy for the essentials to reduce its effectiveness and reduce the chances that Navy can provide future improvements.
A 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have been twice the weight of similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides the hardware problems, the total cost of the project - including training of a crew crew was also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an astounding sum of £3.1 million ($3.6bn) - from %.22 million.2 million.
New ships' problems are of great importance as recent warnings that German naval's strength was falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, German president of parliament, admitted to Navy that it is well "watching the departure and entry of ships which can be used."
The officer said that the problems had lasted over a hundred years, since the older ships were out of work but no ships worked in their place.
He is disappointed that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships have been able to join Navy.
National Trust obeys the silent life of the bats
A new research done in the Scottish Highlands area is intended to reveal how bats use their habitat when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will provide us with a better understanding of the life patterns of these unusual flying creatures and will help direct conservation activities in the future.
A study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual singing pistrellas and Daubenton bats with long brown ears in the Weather Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special record records will be set at specific locations to check the duties of bats throughout the year.
The NHS staff and volunteers will make small inspections using hand-in- hand-manipulations.
A logical analysis of all the records will indicate the frequency of bats ’ calls and what certain animals are doing.
The map of his dwellings and a report will be published to create a detailed model of his life - style.
Rob Dewar, an animal zoo adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which places are most important to bats and how they use them.
This knowledge will help to see the benefits of land management, such as the meadow design, and the best way to preserve the habitats of bats and other related animals.
Scots and all the UK bats were rare throughout the last century.
They are threatened with construction and development that affects their environment and loss.
Electrical and lighting devices can pose dangers, and so can fly - destruction paper and home - care drugs, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
Yet, as they hunt at night, their ears are more active than their eyes when hunting an animal.
They use a complex system of sensory hearing to locate animals and objects in their flight.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, considers bats very important.
It has ten trained professionals, who make regular checkups, to check their location and how to protect them.
This organization even arranged with the Scottish reserve the first and only of the Thrread bats in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scottish bats live.
The head of the area, David Thompson, says this is the best place to live in.
"Here in Threave is the best place for the bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many great trees and other beautiful places.
But there is much about bats we can do, so the work we do here and in other buildings will help us to understand more about what he needs to survive.
He emphasizes the importance of testing for bats before they work on buildings because destruction of their own habitat may kill some 400 female and younger bats, almost killing every resident.
Bats are protected and not permitted by law to kill, maim, or disturb or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to come to help.
He said: ‘ We still have much to learn about our bats, and most of our species don't know what makes them survive.'
Ronaldo resists charges of abuse as lawyers plan to fine a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo spoke of claims that he had accused you of being "false stories," that people "want to improve themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers planned to fine the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which has published the charges.
This Portuguese player and Juventures is accused of sexually abusing an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
It is reported that he has paid $375,000 to cover the case, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on the Instam Live video with his 142 million followers after the charges were reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, has published the reports as "a false story."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, is false stories," says an expert awarded five times for a camera.
"They tried to make a name for themselves by using my name.
It’s normal.
They want to make a name for themselves by calling on my name, but it is part of my job.
I’m happy and everything goes well for me," adds the performer, with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are ready to fine a Der Spiegel on these charges, calling them "an unacceptable report of private life," says Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would want to be replaced with the money for "definition of his dignity with the same number of cases against which he was accused, which is probably the most serious violation of human rights which has occurred recently."
The reported case is said to have taken place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino Las Vegas room.
After meeting at a nightclubs, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's room, where they are said to have violated him, in accordance with paper installed on the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
The Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the event and told him "you are ready" "99 percent" with "1 percent" errors.
The nuns said that Ronaldo had agreed that they had engaged in sexual intercourse, but they had agreed.
Mayorga too has admitted that she has gone to the police and has taken pictures of those who have been injured in the hospital, but she has later admitted that the matter should be handled outside the court because she feels “fear of revenge" and is concerned about the“ public shame. ”
This 34-year-old woman says she wants to change the agreement as she continues to be hurt by what is said to have happened.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid from Manchester United with the charges, and this year he changed to the great Italian group Juve to £100 million.
Brexit: US'UK will always complain of loss of car manufacturers
The UK will always regret it" if he loses his position as head of the world to set up motor vehicles after Brexit, says Dr. Greg Clark.
He has also added the "terrific" that the Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a contract it will temporarily stop the production in its body in Burkiston, near Derby.
"We need a agreement," says Mr Clark.
This Japanese designer said that the result of delay in failure to agree with Brexit could cause loss of jobs.
The Burkinaston firm - making Auris and the Toyotis industry - produced some 150,000 vehicles last year and 90% were shipped to other European Union countries.
"What I think if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March will stop at our industry," says Marvin Cooke, the manager of the Toyota in Burkiston.
Some UK car manufacturers have threatened to come out of the EU without agreement on how trade with other countries will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Oxford Day industry a month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to what car manufacturers call dangerous if the Brexit contracts fail.
The Toyota product is carried on "according to the need of the time", parts of cars arrive every 37 minutes from both the UK and the EU by ordered vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract on 29 March, there may be disturbances in the boundaries that the industry says can lead to slowing and late parts of car construction.
It is impossible for Toyota to catch more than one - day cars in their Derbyshire industry, says this company, so the production may have to be stopped.
Mr Clark says that the Chequers system of Theresa May for future cooperation with the EU is "required carefully so as to avoid such checks on the border."
"We need to get an agreement. We want to find the best agreement we will accept, since we will not only succeed now but also take advantage of this opportunity," he tells the BBC Radio program.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but also from other industries is that we have to be able completely to carry on what has been a successful surgical procedure."
Toyota was unable to state how long the production would be stopped, but in time, it warns that additions of costs will reduce industry efficiency and will eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burkinaston for 24 years and has been a co-conventator of the Union’s central firm, says that his members are concerned: "What I have seen if the tasks do not return.
A government spokesman says: "We have set up a clear and reliable system for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be delayed again, says White House
The eagerly anticipated meeting of Donald Trump and the lawyer's assistant general Rod Rosenstein may be "discovered by another check" as the battle of the supreme court and the establishment of Brett Kavansaugh continues, says the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of a special attorney Robert Mueller, who checks on Russian elections, links between Trump and Russia, and possible legal disturbances from the president.
Whether Trump will expel the lawyer's assistants in general, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has given Washington news matters that can be discussed for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed having entered a pipe to record interviews with Trump and the opportunity of the president’s expulsion at the cost of the 25th.
Rosenstein turned down this report.
But last Monday you went to the White House, although there are reports that you are about to leave the job.
Instead, meeting Trump, then the United Nations in New York, is announced to be Thursday.
Trump said "Defend" not to attack Rosenstein but to start off to avoid confrontation with the Senate committee of justice where Kavanough and one of the women accused of abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both became witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered that a single week's investigation of the FBI for charges against Kavanough, further reducing the full suit of Senate.
Trump writer, Sarah Sanders, has appeared in the Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The day of that which he was not yet appointed, it may be this week, I think that will be reduced by another check as there are other things that are going on with the high court.
But I will see and like to keep the news know what is going on.
Some news reporters may not agree: Sanders never had a White House conference since 10 September.
System administrator Chris Wallace has asked you why.
Sanders said that the decline of these meetings is not due to the fact that the media "fondness to talk," although he has said: "I will not deny the fact that they are talking."
Then he points out that communication between Trump and the press will be more than one option.
"The president has done more question and answers than any other president before him," he said, adding without proving the evidence: "We are looking at those numbers."
There will still be meetings, says Sanders, but "if the media get the opportunity to ask the U.S. president directly, that is better than talking to me.
We try to do that many times and you have seen us do so much in the past few weeks and will take the place of a press conference if you are to be able to speak with the U.S. president.
Trump usually listens to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public chat rooms or news conferences with respected visitors.
It is not unusual for him to ask questions when he is alone.
New York this weekend the president has probably shown why, by not being concerned and at times by careless talk in front of the press.
The Secretary of Health writes to the EU personnel in NHS in Scotland about what Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU workers in Scotland to express appreciation and worldly wishes for post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter that was left six months before the UK dropped to the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying for the necessary expenses of EU citizens for public service.
In his book, Nsz Freeman wrote: "Unlikely, the discussions between the UK and the EU have proceeded, looking at the choices expected in the autumn.
But the UK State has also been preparing its programs for the ban.
I know that this may not be a good time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize now how much I appreciate the work done by all the crew members, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from the EU, and elsewhere, bring in the billions of valuables and skills that strengthen and improve the health care and benefit the patients and the communities we work for.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.

International buyers will be paid more on a stamp when they buy a house in the UK
International buyers will be paid more money when they buy a UK house so that the money can be used to help the homeless under Tory new programs
This will make Corbyn difficult to find young people to vote.
The rise of the unit money will be required on those who do not pay the US tax.
The financial community is expected to earn about £20 million a year to help the homeless
The foreign buyers will be paid for a higher stamp money if they buy a UK - this money to be used for the homeless, and Theresa May will announce today.
This will be viewed as an attempt to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in getting young people to vote for more inexpensive housing and to be looked after by middle - class people.
A raise of stamp money will work for people and businesses who do not pay the US tax, and this added money will help in the State’s effort to eliminate the homeless.
This extra - supplement to the current stamp money, including high - quality ladders installed two years ago in the second and sold houses — may be up to 3 percent.
The finances expect this to give them about £20 million a year.
About 13 percent of London's rebuilding houses are purchased by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new customers to obtain housing.
The majority of the wealthy of this - mainly in the capital - have become "cramber cities" because of the high number of foreign customers who spend most of their time away from the country.
The new goal comes after a few weeks, Boris Johnson spoke of a reduction in the cost of the stamp to help more young people find their first houses.
He has proposed construction projects by keeping the size of the upper room by taking up the building site and not using it, and has urged Mrs.
Mr Corbyn has announced a dramatic series of proposed changes in the home, including the control of rent and the elimination of the “right. ”
He also wants to supply larger forces to build new homes.
Mkz May said: "Last year I said that I would devote myself to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means real - estate repair.
Britain will always be ready to receive people who want to stay, work, and build life here.
It would not be appropriate, however, for non-UK people, as well as for foreign companies, to buy homes rather than hard - working British citizens.
For most people the dream of having a house has become an impossible thing, and the lack of respect for lying down on the street continues to fade.
Jack Ross: 'My greatest wish is to be a Scottish trainer'
Sunderland Captain Jack Ross says that "the great desire" does not become a Scottish instructor one day.
Ross, 42 years old, wishes the challenge of helping the North-east party, now the third of the League One, left by three points.
You have moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish Premiership for the past ordeal.
"I wanted to play my country as a player.
I got a Bcap and it ended up," Ross tells BBC Scotland's Sports.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland several times in Hammpden my father as a child, and it has always been my dream.
I can only get that opportunity, however, if I succeed as a sub-group instructor.
The instructors before Ross in Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moeses, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Ross, who was instructor of Alloa Athletic, says that he was not afraid to join the main staff, since he has refused applications from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success to me now will be determined if I'm able to return the group to the Premier League."
In view of the structure and structure of the group, there is no doubt that it should be introduced to the Premier League," he says.
"It's not easy for me to take it back, but I'll probably consider myself successful where if I can get the group back."
Ross has been an instructor for only three years, after a short time as an instructor in Dummarton and 15 months as an instructor in the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa escape from the cave, and he turned St Mirnen, which was almost eaten by the shirt to Championship champions for the next bit.
And Ross says he feels more confident now than when he was a performer in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"But things suddenly changed completely," you recall, by training Alloa.
"I was absolutely sure that the training work was good for me, more than being a player.
It sounds so ridiculous because I played well, was healthy, and had some things I enjoyed.
But play is not easy.
There are many things to do every week.
I still do those things when it comes to pressures and work, but I love training.
I have always wanted to train and am now doing it, and I feel that I am now doing something I want to do all my life as an adult. ’

The right time for the pin is 5.30pm on Saturday, says survey.
The influx of summer has opened up some of Britain’s hard - working branches but has made it difficult for restaurants to overload.
Cash groups are elevated by 2.7 percent by the people who buy by July - but at restaurants down by 4.8 percent, says statistics.
Peter Martin, of the sizines consultancy CGA, who has received these statistics, says: "The continuing success and participation of England over the longer than expected in the World Cup means that July followed the same course of the past month of June, when the lungs rose by 2.8 percent, except that the restaurants stay below.
The 1.8 percent falling from the sale of restaurants in June has become worse by July.
Binge tubs and bars are far more profitable than restaurants.
Baths sell food and carry it with them in the sun, although it was not as bad as restaurants.
It seems that people simply wanted to take them out for a drink.
In the lungs and bars the sale of drinks has increased by 6.6 percent this month, food has dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a researcher on entertainment and receptions RSM, says: "These effects continue what we have seen since the end of April.
The climate and the outcome of major events or sports events will always be powerful factors when it comes to sales.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to haul hard, though sales by 4.8 percent each year will be painful in spite of constant cost problems.
The long hot summer has arrived very badly in food markets, and in time it will seem that the low temperature we had in August will give us what we need.
The increase in sales in the workshops and restaurants, including recently opened stores, was 2.7 percent by July, indicating a decrease in rent figures.
The Coffer Peach Tracker’s stock industry, banks and UK restaurants, collects and analyzes the data of 47 working groups, which produce more than £9 million, and is the beginning of a developing track.
1 child in 5 has private chat rooms that his parents have hidden
1 child in 5 - 11 - with private contacts hidden from his parents and teachers, reveals a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school seniors showed an increase in the "Insta" pages.
The news media bring out the possibility of sexually explicit material
20 percent of people who say they have an account "The real" show children
1 out of 5 - 11 - others open chat rooms that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school children showed rapid growth in the "Insta" accounts - which refers to the Instagram photo route.
The news media create the fear of being rid of sexually explicit images.
20 percent of them say that they use a clean account "the best" they show to parents, while they have some secret.
One mother who somehow saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a youth asking others to "take her away."
This study, of the Digital Awards UK and Headmasters" and Headminds" Conferences (HMC), found 40 percent of children 11 to 18 years of age with two profiles, half admitted to having private accounts.
“ It is disturbing, ” says HMC director Mike Buchanan, “that so many young people are tempted to build accounts on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find it.
Eilidh Doyle will draw a "Player voice" on the Scottish Atletics board
Elidh Doyle has been selected by the Scottish Athletics board as chairman at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a popular Scottish player and chairman Ian Beattie has described this act as a good opportunity for those who supervise sports to benefit from his larger billions of sports events in the past ten years.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and all the world's players, and we are sure that Scottish sports will benefit greatly by taking him on board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I’m determined to be the voice of the players and I hope to be more generous and to assist in directing sports in Scotland.
This American player, who won 200 mnetres and 400 meteres in the 1995thies of Atlanta between his four Olympic medals and is now a normal BBC expert, finds himself unable to walk after a stroke (TIA).
He wrote to Twitter: "Last month I lost my stroke.
I couldn’t move.
The doctors told me that in time I would see whether I would recover or how far I would go.
In a panic, I recovered fully, had to learn to walk, and today I am still exercising!
Thank you for the instructions to encourage me!"
Introduction between mothers and cattle causes a break in the Internet.
The breast pumping company has caused a break in the Internet with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cattle.
In order to mark the installation of what is said to be the "Using breast pump on the world's first sound," Elvie client company has released a comical video presentation to show freedom for the new breast-feed mothers.
Four mothers sing a song in a cowboat with the words: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see the tail" and say "If you didn't see this one who was not milk, my breasts."
The cconsole says: "Out of the neck take it out, let go the burs out, feed the children, take out the burs out of the hole, take them out, feed my friends."
This advertisement, however, printed on the Facebook page of this company, has caused controversy in the Internet.
This video of 77,000 who have seen it with hundreds of compartments has received different views from observers, where many say it is looking down on the “weight ” of the milk industry.
"It is the worst decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken a few days after birth, ” writes another.
Elvie breast pump enters hidden inside the breast brush (Elvie/Mther).
Another said: "It is a difficult situation for both mother and baby.
But why don't you use a breast tap to advertise mothers who are able to keep their children safe?
Another said: "This advertising is not appropriate."
Some have protected this advertisement, and another woman admitted that she had found a song of “laughter. ”
"I think this is a good idea."
I would buy it if they were still feeding me.
Murdering just made me feel like a cow.
The advertiser is exaggerated but I have heard the meaning.
This product will be very useful," writes one.
One has adopted: "This advertisement is funny and refers to mothers pumping (usually at work or in private rooms) and feels like ‘ cattle. ’
This is not a advertising that glorifies or condemns the milk industry.
At the end of the video the women’s group showed that they had been dancing through hidden pumps under their shirts.
The goal of the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast - feeders say they feel like cattle.
But Elvie Pump, has no noise, no strings or tubes and wears it hidden under the breastbula, gives women freedom to move, manage their children, and pull them out.
Ana Bararin, Dad's ECD equivalent, has noted: "Elvie Pmp is a product that will have much to do and therefore would be appropriate for the presentation.
By comparing breast - feeding women to cattle we wanted to put breast - feeding with all its challenges in public, while expressing in a pleasant and understandable way the feeling of relief that a new pump would bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has become the most common.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children came from the cathalk of the architect Marta Jaboowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migraines Move Peacefully to a Tent Camp on the Texas border
The number of adopted children has increased even though it did not change the monthly number of those who passed through the border, partly because hard-identified police in Trump office made it difficult to provide support.
Often, many activists are unsalaried immigrants, and they have been afraid to risk their stay in this country by identifying themselves as a parent.
The danger is serious in June, when the authorities announce that the supporters and other adult members of the home will have to send a line of fingers, and that the ring will be given to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the Immunity and Customs Environment, acknowledged before the Congres that this ladder has arrested many people who are registered to support children without parents.
The general later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested had no crime.
"About 80 percent of the people who are not supportive or family members are illegal here, and the majority are criminals.
So we continue to search for those people," says Mr. Albence.
Wanting to produce children quickly, officials have set up new rules that will require that some of them appear in court during the month, not after 60 days, the former law, in accordance with the Shelter staff.
Most will appear on a video conference, not in person, to request legal rights in a foreign court.
Those considered unworthy will soon be deported.
If children stay in prison for a long time, they are more likely to be anxious or depressed, which may lead to violence or attempt to escape, in accordance with shelter workers and reported reports from the mast in previous months.
The attorneys say that this concern is growing in a larger facility as in Tornillo, where signs that a child is having difficulty may be ignored, because of the size of the area.
They also add that moving children to a tent town without taking the time to prepare for themselves emotionally or even to say good - bye to friends can cause a lot of damage that they already have.
Syria tells the U.S., French and Turkish troops to withdraw quickly
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem spoke to the Syrians to return home, even though the war in their country is now her eighth year.
Moualem, also the prime minister's assistant, has declared foreign troops illegal in Syria, saying they will bring an end to terrorism, and they will be "treated accordingly."
"He must go quickly without orders," and tell the audience.
Moualem asserts that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "fight this sacred war and cleanse the whole area of Syria" from terrorist groups and "anyone from abroad."
The United States has about 2,000 Syrian soldiers, who are concentrated in training and directing troops in the Kurdish and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 militarized soldiers in a war-in country.
As for refugees, Moulem says the circumstances allow them to return, and he blames "some western countries" for“ terrors ” to prevent refugees from returning.
He said, "We have spoken to the international community and social community to ensure that the refugees are returning.
"They are politically involved in a matter which should be handled only by the welfare of the community."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help his Syria again until a political concordat between Assad and anti-war counters.
UN agents say that the newly formed treaty between Russia and Turkey to form a border in his last large Idébishan fortress is an opportunity to continue with political discussion.
The Russian and Turkish concordat has prevented a major attack on Russian - sponsored Syrians in a province, where three million people live.
However Moulem stressed that the treaty "had been fixed for a definite time" and hopes that the soldiers will attack the Pihadists and the Nustra Fronts who are associated with Al-Qaeda, "they will be killed."
UN ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon arrange the first meeting of a new committee that includes the government and opposing members so that the foundation of the postwar Syria will be registered and set up a choice.
Moulem has placed limits on the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the management job should end up "by looking into the titles of the new constitution," and warned of being disturbed.
Why will Trump win a second time?
In that sense, Mr. Trump can win the second election in 2020 unless, as there are many non-repetators who may wish to be so, dishonest and wrong that could take him away from the president.
That will undoubtedly be the most historic end of the president’s history!

Hundreds of coins are installed in the middle age of the House conflict
It is not surprising that the 17th of the 17th, because of the restructuring of the constituents and two officers in the competition with the same seat.
This newly painted state of Pittsburgh set him up in the Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb - who defeated his chair in another region in a special election last spring.
Lamb is still competed with another conflict, Republican Keith Rothfus, now representing the old state of Pennsylvania of 12, which runs to 17 new.
Maps were drawn again after the Pennsylvania High Court decided on January that the old provinces violated the law by stealing votes to the Republic.
The 17th contest has removed the financial competition between the members of the larger team, the Democratic Campaign Congeral Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
The name Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after winning a special March widely watched by many Pennsylvania's 18th Congress.
That position held by the Republican for more than ten years, President Donald Trump won the district by 20 pounds.
Politicians have given the Democrats a measure of opportunity.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for upholding China, Repetition
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noticed Beijing, with a little supplication from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a free conference with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to call again the American Diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest decision not to cooperate with Taiwan," Heather Nauert, who speaks for the door, says at the beginning of this month.
But El Salvador is paid only for $140 million in aid to America in 2017, and to control narctics, to improve and sustain the economy.
The recommended fee, which included cutting out financial assistance and granting limits on information, may have caused the country the pain of Central America because of the increase in unemployment and murder.
As their conferences improved, North American and Central American officials postponed a high conference focused on protecting and promoting the economy in order to follow the same gathering held last year as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid- September, the senior executives made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any idea of the fines of El Salvador.
President Mike Pance's assistant should now arrange to speak with the conference, which is now arranged to be in the middle of October, as a symbol by the administrators, said the officers.
And three American representatives peacefully returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without strong new messages or punishments from Washington.
The title of the White House of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two missions, who agreed to discuss internal intentions of privacy.
Their accounts are verified by an external investigator closely related to the management and discussed the nature of privacy.
A Lesson From History
The following incident may be the report of Robert Mueller's special counselor against Mr. Trump, and now there is overwhelming evidence on the public record.
Mr. Mueller is said to be investigating whether Mr. Trump was linked with Russia in his attempt to attack our choice.
If Congres change, Mr. Trump will find himself facing charges on this body, as he prepares to stand before the panel and perhaps finally before the court.
These have many limitations, and I do not say that Mr. Trump’s fall is certain to happen to Europe.
There are decisions all of us should make on both sides of the Atlantic to affect the length of the conflict.
In 1938, German officials were ready to set up a coup d'état against Hitler, as long as the West was against him and supported the Czechoslovakias in Munich.
We failed, and we missed out on the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History goes back and forth in such instances, and repeated efforts to enforce the will of the common people either intensify or fail for years to come.
The Americans are now experiencing many of these events.
What would we do if Mr. Trump drove Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested, in secret, recording the president and commenting on his failure to carry on his work.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times account is not accurate.
"How will we react if a new investigation of F.B.I.B.A. Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unjust - or if presented to the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote during the middle season to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do so, the majority’s will will will not be fulfilled for a long time.
But I believe we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish exiled to Auschwitz, the same Nazi regime that once ruled over my agency.
She survived, moved to America, and, after 60 years, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles at the swastika table.
As an inheritance, how could I be without hope for our future? ’

Graham Dorrans of Rangers hope as the game approaches Rapid Vienna
Rangers play at home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victorious Austrians, after playing similarly in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good chance to pass through the Europ G of the European League.
The knee injury has prevented the stomach player Graham Dorrans from playing again for the first time in the tragedy until they play the same way with Villarreal, but you believe that Rangers can use those effects to look forward in larger things.
"It was good to find this point because Villarreal is a good team," says this 31-year-old player.
"We go to this game in faith to bring something back and get the point.
We may have found a goal near the end but, otherwise, to play equally well.
They played better than we did, and on the second, we played better.
On Thursday, we play another European game.
We hope to find three points but it will be a hard game because they have played well in the past but, because our fans will encourage us, I’m sure we’re going to play and get good results.
Last year, during all the things that have happened through my injuries and changes in the group itself, but things seem to improve right now.
The group is pleasant and happy; it also provides training.
We hope we will work now, go through the past and succeed.
Women are unable to sleep because they are afraid of pensions
Despite the clear perception of how much they need to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about it.
Nearly half of mankind’s population said that they talked to their spouse about the long - term cost of attention.
Only 10 percent said that they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but don't take steps to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, the vice president of the National Insurance industry.
Let the account come to life.
Discuss with your spouse and children: You cannot provide for your family if you do not share your expectations one at a time.
Also, seek out your counselor and your family to discuss how and where to look after them, since such decisions can have a profound effect on how much money to be made.
Here is your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you to come up with a plan to pay the bills.
Your long - term health - care decisions may include the possibility of a long - term insurance policy, a life insurance policy that provides a financial incentive to pay for these costs or to be a health insurance - as long as you have money.
Correct your law - abiding citizens: Guard against legal battles.
Get a health - care professional to set up a person you trust to care for your treatment and to make sure that your doctors comply with your wishes if you cannot talk.
Also, consider the speed of anturney on your finances.
He will choose someone you trust to make your money and make sure that your expenses are paid if you can no longer do anything.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine your elderly parent being hit by a emergency and rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his or her health?
Make a note of those specific details so that you can prepare for the situation.
"Not only money should be checked, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by earthquakes and tsunamis in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, say the authorities, the number of dead is expected to increase.
Since communication is in short supply, relief workers were unable to obtain information from Donggaga departments, the northern region of Palu near the center of the 7.5 earthquakes.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been abandoned after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Pallu and Dongga, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of Central Sulawesi, located at the western end of the island of Sulawesi, and has an average population of 39,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating for 40 years during the tsunami.
Dongga is over 200 miles [180 km] off the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
This area, the province under state, had about 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and farming are ways of living in the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongga.
Coin mines are also important in this region, being found in plenty in Molowal, beyond the coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongga have been hit several times during the last 100 years, in accordance with Indonesia's Disiserigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is in the moving part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often struck by an earthquake.
Here are some areas that have been struck by major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra in Dec. 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 266,000 people near the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the Aceh coast.
2005: A series of earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March to early April.
There died hundreds of men on the island of Nias, which is a long way off the coast of Sumatra.

Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 quake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, and a 30- foot [10 m] tsunami destroyed many places and killed 300 people.
In 2016: A small earthquake struck Pidie Jaya in Aceh, destroying and making people fearful of the 2004 earthquake and tsunamis.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.

The attacks destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of visitors homeless.
Sarah Palin’s Old Son Accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of an early Alaskan emperor and co-stique for president Sarah Paran, is arrested for torture charges.
Palin, 29 years old, of Yasilla, Alaska, is arrested for torture, disrupting the report of violence and opposition to imprisonment, in accordance with a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
In harmony with the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the crime, she telephoned him.
Salin is chained to Matt-Su Pretrial Facility and charged with an unprotected ball for $500, reports KTUU.
He has appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "not guilty, certainly" when questioned, reports the network.
Salin faces three Class A cases, which means that they may be imprisoned for a year and fined $50,000.
Also charged in Article B, she will be fined for the day in prison with $2,000.
Not first is Palin charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was charged with beating his father, Todd Baran.
Her mother, Sarah Palan, called the police to report this activity.
This case is currently in the hands of the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, disrupting the report of domestic violence, and holding a weapon at the time drunk in connection with the incident.
Her daughter had slapped him in the face.
Sarah Paran was criticized by professional teams in 2016 after her son's violent acts are related to PTSD because of his Iraqic activity.
Indonesia’s tsunami: Most people die
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island Sulawesi on Friday.
This 7.5 quake created a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric and communications communications are out of the question and may increase the number of those who have died in the days to come.
The quake struck the center of Sulawesi in the northeastern part of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos convey the idea of a face - to - face meeting.
There were hundreds of people assembled at the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck off the coast.
Public prosecutors seek an unusual death sentence from a terrorist in the NYC
Government prosecutors in New York were looking for a death sentence on Saifullo Saipov, a New York City terrorist who killed eight people -- an unusual sentence that had not been executed on a crime case since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used the rented Home Depot truck to attack the West Side Highway route in Lower Manhattan, which struck and killed pedestrians and cyclists on that route by Oct.
To be able to inflict capital punishment, the prosecutors will have to show that Saipov has deliberately killed eight people and that they were " deliberately" seriously wounded in the body, in accordance with the notice of an attempt to obtain a death sentence, issued by the Southern District of New York.
Both acts carry the weight of a death sentence, in accordance with the court’s justice.
After some weeks, the question court presented Saipov with 22 cases involving eight murder cases, commonly used by public prosecutors in organized cases of crime, and the crime of violence and car destruction.
The attack required "prediction and good thought," said the prosecutors, explaining how Saipov has done it as "sing, aggressive and offensive."
"Sayfullo Habullaev has caused damage, killed families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernian Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the court notice.
The five slain were Argentine visitors.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York last handled the death sentence.
The defendant, Calaid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug workers but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence was issued in New York was in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married persons who were killed after being found guilty of placing the Soviet Union on notice during the Cord War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has demonstrated his lack of heart in the days and months following the attack, according to a court council.
He told the interrogators that you felt good about what he had done, saying the police.
Saipov told the authorities that the thing he had done in this way was to watch ISIS videos on his phone, in accordance with his statements.
She also asked for an IIC flag to be displayed in her hospital room, said the police.
He is not responsible for the 22 charges.
David Patton, a public representative of Saipov, says that they are "frustrated as expected" by a court decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence rather than to accept an application to be thrown into prison without the chance of release will only make it easy to be shocked in these events for all concerned," says Patton.
The Saipov rescue team had asked the prosecutors not to accept the death penalty.
Toy Minister says NIGEL FRANCE should direct talks and Brexit
Nigel Faage vowed ‘ to organize a society' today during the rebellion in the Tory District.
A former Ukip leader says that politicians had to be 'acquired' by the Eurosceptics - since one of the ministers of Theresa May says that he should be the one who controls the talks and the EU.
An empty member of parliament Peter Bone told the protesters at Birmingham that the UK would have been 'at left' now if Mr Faage was Brexit'.
But Mrs. May's challenge in gathering together members of his isolated group is noted by the older Tory members who have joined a different protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fails to keep his Chequers program going well despite the attacks on Brexit, Remainers, and EU members.
Some members have insisted that they would go ahead trying to make a agreement with Brussels despite the conflict in the past - and force the Eurosceptics and Labours to choose between his ‘ chaos'.
Mr Bone has told the Leave Means Leave in Solhull that you want to ‘ finish with Chequers'.
He said Mr Farage should be made a pillar and assigned the task of communicating with Brussels.
'If you had been in charge, we would now have gone out,' he said.
Wellingborough Officer has added: ‘ I will represent Brexit but we have to finish with Cheques.'
Describing his differences with the EU, he says, "We have not fought the wars of the world, that we may be slaves.
We want to make our own rules in our country.
Mr Bone has dismissed the assumption that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: 'Britain' has changed the idea that the Britons have wanted to remain completely untrue.'
Andrea Jenskyns of Tory, a Brexit supporting Brexit, was also in the riot, telling the servants on the platform: ‘ I mean, Sir, listen to people.
'People don't want Chequers, the opposing team won't vote, our group doesn't want to be seen by our street people who walk on the streets and get us to be elected in the first place.
Please forget Chequers and begin listening.
In a straightforward message to Mrs. May, he said, 'O Presidents continue to perform their duties if they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the co-constituents in the exhibition that they must be 'pressed' if they forget the decisions they had made in the 2016 revolution.
'This is now a matter of loyalty between us - and our political class,' she says.
'They try to be disloyal to Brexit and we are here today to tell them that 'we' won't suddenly let you do that'.'
In a strong message he said to the multitude, ‘ I want to make the political party, and now they are in danger of breaking Brexit, and they feel oppressed. ’
'We use this country' which has made us victorious in Brexit and will not be discouraged until we become an independent, independent state, the proud United Kingdom.'
In the meantime, the Remainers rioted at Birmingham before having a quarter of an hour in the city.
The main authorities were carrying the placards entitled Tories Against Brexit after the group was formed in the week.
Labour member Lord Adonis made a joke of Conservatives about the security problems they had with the group's App during the opening of the conference.
‘ These are people who tell us that they can set up the IT and all Canada's technology and so forth, a trouble-free line, free trade without borders with Ireland, and add.'
'It' is total waste.
There is no such thing as Brexit, which adds.
Warren’s settings for 'resplicing' president decision
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says you will look closely at the president's option after November option.
The Boston Globe reports that this Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future in the city hall west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who always criticizes President Donald Trump, enters the Novemberward option against the World’s GOP Rep. Geoff Diehl, former vice president of Trump in the 2016 campaign at Massachusetts.
She was in a large position to compete with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Hotewe was his 36th assembly using the city hall since Trump became president.
Someone in the audience has asked you if you are planning to make a choice.
Warren replied that it is time for "Women to go to Washington to correct our corrupt government, and that includes a woman who will be president."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to discover the earth after following group guidelines that enabled him to conquer Sebastian Vettel
It became evident that the Valterte Bottas succeeded in passing the Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team guidelines will play a major role in the race.
From the beginning, Bottas started out well and likely got in touch with Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack a gang member.
Vettel has first entered the pits and left Hamilton to block traffic in the team's tail, which should have been the determining factor.
Mercedes entered the pit after the cycle and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton was behind the contest that forced Ferra driver to leave the inside safe after two years of protection on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started on the rear line of the grid and became the seventh at the end of the first cycle on his 21st birthday.
He then leads a large part of the race as he has continued his wheels so as to press on to finish fast and pass the Kimi Raikkonen as the fourth.
He finally reached the pits on the 44th cycle but was unable to increase his speed in the eight remaining turns as Raikkonen was the fourth.
The day is hard because Valtte has done a good job for a whole weekend and has been kind enough for me.
The group has done an admirable job with 1.2," says Hamilton.
His Body’s Ability to Repair Wounds
President Donald Trump has laughed at the Sanator Dianne Feinstein conference on Saturday as he insisted that he did not show anyone a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the High Court of Appeals for sexual assault.
Speaking at a West Virginia conference, the president did not speak directly about the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but noted that what happened to Senate showed that people were "unreasonable and untrustworthy.
"One thing that could happen and the good thing which went on in the past few days with Senate, when you see wrath, when you see men angry and unkind and insensitive and unfaithful," he said.
"When you look at the broken news and say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do You Recall?
Did Dianne Feinstein, tell someone?
You remember her answer...
Oh, no.
I didn't send anyone.
Well, wait a minute.
We have sent him... No, we sent no one," he said, referring to the senator.
Feinstein received a letter containing information about the charges against Kavanough by Ford back in July, and it appeared at the beginning of September - but Feinstein denied that this commission had come out of his office.
"I did not hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I sent no one," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"You have asked me to keep it a secret and have kept it as secret as I have asked."
But his denial did not sound well to the president, who has commented during a Saturday night gathering: "This is what I shall say, the movement of his body is rich.
She may not have done it, but her bodily movements are rich.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court prosecutor, who was accused of abuse of three women, the president stated that the Democrats used charges for their services.
"They are willing to fight for power by whatever means they may do.
You see a lack of kindness, apathy, who is hurt, who should pass over them to rule and control," reports the Mediaite in the words of the president.
Cell Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer hit two Giants playing with Dundee
The Dundee Stars is back in full force after being hit on Friday in Elte College playing with the Belfast Giants by winning the next game at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants have earned two grades at the start of the game by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie played the game at home before Dwyer struck the third of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard has struck the Dundee rating before Lumpvald Nielsen struck two courses to win the game.
This was the third time that the group of Adam Keefe were eaten from Elite League, since they had returned and were eaten and subdued on Friday night beating Dundee at 21 Belfast.

The first Dwyer goal was entered at the fourth minute of 3:35 at the time the ball was installed from Kendall McFall, by David Rutherford drilled while Beauviller played the second goal after four minutes.
In a play that has been several years old in the beginning, Sullivan hopes the team who played at home at 13: 10 before Matt Marardt sent the ball to Cownie when he played the rating at 15: 16.
Dwyer has seen to it that the Giants are at the front of the vacation when they hit his second goal that day towards the end of the first ball.
The group he was playing at home was back in force, and Bouchard again struck a good rating at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have met to help Nielsen play the Dundee’s leading team for the first time in the game towards the end of the second track, and he made sure that they won the game by striking the fifth when the game was about to end.
The Gaants, who have now been beaten in their four fifth of the previous five games, play at home with Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An Air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people on a plane escape from the earthquake
The pilot in Indonesia is honored after death to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers arrives safely on the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are not yet found after the great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered a tsunami.
There is a powerful movement to continue its attack, and many are trapped in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of her colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunwan Aung refused to leave work on the building which was struggling to control aircraft at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu port.
She lived to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 632, which was on the highway, would be able to move safely.
He then jumps out of the aircraft control tower while he thinks it is slipping away.
He has died later in the hospital.
An Air Navigation spokesman in Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that this decision could save hundreds of people, reports the ABC News of Australia.
We have arranged a helicopter from the Balikppan in Kalimanntan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we have failed and have died this morning before the plane reached Pallu.
"Our hearts are troubled to hear of this," he has added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the emergency service agency says it is not easy to enter the cities of Dongga, Sig, and Bouting.
"We believe that the number of dead is still rising as many bodies are still under the destruction of them while there are many that we could not reach," says the communications spokesman Sutopo Puro Nucroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] have destroyed Palu that will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Aircraft and transport supplies and the necessities of life.
Risa Kukusu, a 35- year old mother, told Sky News: Every minute an ambulance brings the dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The markets have been plundered everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the world Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia helps the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
Already this is a disaster, but it can be even worse.
The Indonesian President Joko Widdo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: "All of you will work day and night to finish all the work on the release.
Are you ready? "Save CNN".
Indonesia has been hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok where more than 550 people have died.
Micronesia crash: Air Niugini now claims that one person is lost after a plane crash in a lagoon
The Airline that controls a crash in the Pacific agoon in Micronesia now says that there is one person out of sight, after all 47 passengers and crews are safely taken out of the landing aircraft.
The Air Niugini has said that since Saturday afternoon she can't tell of a male passenger.
The Airline says that she has been working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find this man.
The Airline did not respond immediately when asked to reveal details of this passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boats have helped other passengers and crew after the plane crash in the water while attempting to sail to the Chuuk Island port.
The authorities had seven persons taken to the hospital on Friday.
The Airline says six passengers are staying in the hospital on Saturday, and all are in good sight.
What is behind this crash and how this happens is not clear.
The Airline and the U.S. Navy both claimed that the cable in a lagoon has not yet reached the airport route.
Some Witnesses think that the plane is over the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the cable is in the water at a low speed.
"It's really a good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes and others have been able to travel through the water that they keep on their waist to the registered exits of an airplane.
He said that the servants of the airplane were trembling and speaking, and that he had a little bruise in the head.
The U.S. Navy says that crew crews who work nearby to improve the wharf are also helping when people are being taken out by the airboat to reach the shore before the plane sinks a hundred feet [30 m] in water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 1,111 people have died in the PNG-registration crash in the past 20 years, but nothing includes Air Niugini.
Annalyst cites the night time of a burned - out woman
The prosecutor accused on Saturday of a man accused of burning a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for many hours as an expert witness in the field of intligence nalysis.
He has told the jury how he has used telephone records to locate the places that 29- year- old defendant Qunton Tellis had been visited and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett has found details about the place on several calls that revealed that Tellis was with Cberers on the afternoon of his death, in contrast with what he said earlier, reports The Clairion Ledger.
When the details indicate that his phone was on Cberers during the time he had a friend; here Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was right when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lucky because his truck was in Nashville."
Another difference is that Tellis had known Czebers for two weeks before he died.
Telephone records indicate that they exchange one another for a week.
Rowlett says that some time beforeceers died, Tellis turned off Chamberlain’s websites, telephones, and telemarketing details.
"He took him out of his life," says Hale.
The suspect is arranged to start talking on Sunday.
The judge expected the case to go to the jury on that day.
High Breed: What is conscilius hip hop?
The hip hop group wants to challenge such negative views by filling their songs with encouraging words.
High Breed, from Bristol, says hip hop is no longer what it used to be by having political messages and talking about social problems.
She wants to return to the treatment and is made popular once again.
Songers such as The Fgues and Commons have later seen an increase in the UK in song as Aka and Lowkey.
Someone brown?!
The U.S. child watcher accuses the parents of expelling her with a message showing "prediction"
The child watcher in New York accuses the husband and wife of expelling her with racist remarks after having received a message from the mother of the erroneous child saying "It was another black person."
The parents deny that they are prejudiced, saying that the charges are done "for the sake of financial gain."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that she was going to watch over her young child, Giselle Maurice, a black person when he arrived on his first day to work in 2016.
" NOOOOOOOOOOOOO, ONE ASSET," writes Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After seeing his supervisor, "unfree" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Msz. Maurice, who is a wandering guard of her children, an African-American, did an unpleasant job and expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Msz. Maurice was paid for a day’s work and was then transferred to our home by Uber.
Now, Maurice accuses the parents of being unjustly dismissed, and seeks compensation for $350 of the six months, and for the 11-ing that they are recognized, except for the senator.
"I wanted to show that, behold, it is not done," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know that prejudice."
The parents answered that they were prejudiced, saying that to expel Maurice was a good thing, they feared that they would not trust him anymore after the abuse.
"My wife has sent him what he didn't mean.
He is not partial.
We are not prejudiced people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, telling the Post.
"But can you leave your children with the person who was rude to you, even wrongly?
Has your child recently found him?
In fact.
Comparing this charge with the "the money win prize," Plasco says that his wife had been carrying a child for two months and "at the most difficult stage."
"You will attack such a man?
It is not a very good thing," integration bunker adds.
As the case continues, the court of public opinion has been quick to accuse the parents on - line, not encouraging their actions.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that students would not be interested in the document in which they were writing, exposing the newspaper
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was favored, said in a letter: ‘ It is hard to put yourself in the shoe of the reader before it is published.
It is interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success.
He says that his father, who has worked in BBC as a photographer before he was moved to write a children's letter about a small toy bear, would not be discouraged if his work was not popular, added 60th anversary printing of his books to be “a pain and pleasure ” after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which he described as ‘ a very important member of our family, ’ he added that his father was not proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and was not proud," he told them.
"But because Paddington was real to me, it was as if you had a child who had accomplished something: you are proud of it even if it didn't work for you.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success that way.
Even though he was invented and thought of him, he always praised Paddington.
My daughter was dying, and I had to phone her to her
When her daughter is on call, she is rushed to Nice’s Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors work hard to save her life.
"Nad would call always saying that it was too bad, saying he didn't expect to survive," says Mrs Edna-Laperouse.
"I then received a call from Nad saying that he was going to die two minutes from now, and I had to say a farewell to him.
And I said good - bye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you dearly, don't cry.
Soon I will be with you.
I will be with you.
The drugs prescribed for her to maintain her heart rate gradually decreased and disappeared from the body.
She had died some time before and was no longer in use.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I could not scream or cry because my family was surrounded by people.
I really had to control myself.
Finally, Mrs Edna - Laperouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded an airplane with other passengers — obviously because of the tragic situation she faced.
"No one knew," he told them.
"I looked down, and tears were always down.
It is hard to explain, but it was while on a plane that I was sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how they loved her.
A woman wears cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in death work together to prevent others from killing them.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were wearing cards on the Welsh bridge with encouraging words and telephone numbers that people could use to get help.
Msz Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started his depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I do every day," says Mrsz Davis.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a prospective cook and that when he smiled, everyone smiled.
"All people knew of her smile.
They always said that when you smile it is all right.
Nevertheless, she quit her job before she died, since she was "very depressed."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the first to find him after suicide.
Msz Davis said: ‘ I always worry that something like this will happen. ’
Msz Davis began making cards, "to inform people that there are people to talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't bottle up your feelings — you have to talk."
Msz Humphreys, a friend of Nsz Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15 - year - old governor, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling down or depressed or said something," he tells.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a different way in which he did things.
He said that on Christmas Day he was a little lower than when children opened their presents without looking at them or doing anything.
He said that his death was a terrible blow to them, but they had to cope with it: ‘ It’s a great blow to the family.
It hurts us very much.
But all of us must continue to fight.
If it is difficult to cope with the deaths, you can call the Samalantans free of the 116 123 (UK and Ireland), email jo@samarantans.org, or visit the Samalantan Web site here.
The future of Brett Kavansaugh is uncertain as the FBI starts investigation
"I would think, if we could really find something like the one they would want - a quick investigation, big - we could bring a more concordant," says Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "divided" as there were many supporters.
Why do Mr Kavanough and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do research?
The thing they lack is due to time.
The election of the middle season will reach five weeks, November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail, then will be weakened in their efforts to find the one chosen by the highest court.
George W. Bush has been on the telephone calling the Senator, encouraging them to support Mr Kavanough, who worked at the White House for Mr Bush and there met his wife Ashley, who was Sir Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI has released its report?
There will be a Senate option, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democratics.
It is still not clear whether Mr Kavanough can obtain as much as 50 votes from Senate, which will allow Mike Perce, the vice president, to divide equality and present him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's breakups are 'lowing' under Kim
The number of rebels in North Korea to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong-un began to reign seven years ago, says South Korean law expert.
Park Yeong-seug, quoting the details of the South Allied department, says that last year there were 1,127 rebels - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park says that border laws have been tightened between North Korea and China and the high cost required by private employees has a major impact.
Pyongngy never noticed anything in the community.
A large number of rebels from the North eventually gain citizenship rights in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled to China, with a long border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross than Demilitarianed Zone (DMZ) with a barrier between two Koreans.
China considers these heresies as illegal settlers not refugees and is forcing them back into their lands often.
The relationship between the north and the South that are still at war has in some way improved dramatically over the past months.
Early in this month, leaders of these two countries met in Pyongngng in large discussions on the development of nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the June June conference between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on several ways to work to eliminate nuclear weapons in Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs R Yong-ho blame the US authorities for not taking action since.
"Unless the US is confident, there will be no hope for our country's safety and under those conditions, we will never have to close our weapons alone first," says Mr.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanough "the one who is controlled by feelings," saying that she is unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
The House’s Young House Group leader Nancy Pelosi called the candidate of the High Court by Brett Kavanaugh as "the one controlled by feelings" and said that her emotions do not allow her to work in the Supreme Court.
Peter says these words in a Saturday conversation in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I immediately thought that if a woman did that way, it would be said, 'You are under the control of your feelings,' said Peter with his reply to Kavanough before the Senate Judithicary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanough has reacted emotionally to the fact that you have been hit by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in childhood.
During his opening remarks, Kavanough expressed emotions, some of which were extremely loud and persistent when talking to his family and about his high school years.
He also specifically dismissed the Democrats to the committee, calling the charges against which he was accused as "Occasion of organized knowledge of man to be executed" dividated with the people's anger that Hillary Clinto was subjugated to the 2016 election.
Peter said that he believed that Kavanough's evidence indicates that he would fail to work in the Supreme Court, since it shows that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he makes himself unfit by those words and by the way he spoke of Clinton's and Democrats," he said.
Pelo refused when asked if he would try to accuse Kavanough if they were appointed, and that the Democrats found many seats in the House of Resesertives.
"This is what I will say -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or FBI, it means that he isn't qualified not only to the Supreme Court, but also to his present court," says Pelo.
Kavanough is now a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Petrolo has added that like Democrat he is concerned that Kavanough might judge against Affordble Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is thought to be a self-convention judge.
When questioned, Kavanaugh did not answer the questions as to whether he could answer certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotionally charged person, who takes the stand to court and is expected to say, 'Until it' is good,' says Peter.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Power.
Proper discipline, months, and years of burning anger, and there is no other way to grieve than to cry.
"We cry when we get upset," Mrsz. Steinam told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that is unusual, what do you say?"
He added, "I was greatly helped by the woman who was the manager, who said she cried when she was upset, but found out that when she was upset and cried, she would say to the person she spoke to, "You may think that I am upset because I cry."
I'm angry.
Then he went right on.
And I thought that was good.
Tears are shed as a way to let go of resentment, since they have a strong need for people.
One of my early memories, an office full of men, when I found myself crying out for anger that I could not describe, was pulled from my neck by an insulation that I was always on the stairs.
"Be sure they don't see you crying at all," he told me that.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you are upset and will be happy because they have found it.
Patricia Schroeder, who became a Democratic congregantsman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart as he entered the selection.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught committing adultery on a ship called Monkey Business and was discharged from the election, Mrs. Schroeder, with great anger, he saw that he could not satisfy his desire to enter the choice as president.
"It was not a well- planned decision," he said to me when he was laughing some 30 years later.
"Before there were seven more in the race, and a mocker was waiting for the other.
Another called it " Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because she was about to finish the project, she had no money to compete, so she vowed that she would not enter the race until she had $2 million.
It was a battle I could never win.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 million to men could give him $250.
"They think I am getting the price?" He wondered.
When he declared that he would not engage in an organized campaign, he was caught in a frenzy on the backs of people who supported him, a state - of - the - art slide that made it difficult for him to handle money and search for votes rather than to find members, and his anger over the prejudice against women.
"You would think I am engaged," recalls Mrs. Schroeder and how the news had responded to him.
"You can imagine that Kleenex will be a precipice.
I remember thinking, what will they put in my grave?
"She stayed"?"
How the U.S. trade can be beneficial in Beijing
The salvos that start the trade war between the US and China were deafing, and as the war is far away, the conflict between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the future, say experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, has issued the first warning earlier this year of imports to China, including electrical, metal, and aluminium.
The biggest tragedy that happened this week is the new towels affecting the cost of $200 billion (£150 Billion), adding half of all US imports from China.
Beijing has returned each time in the same way, recently setting up between 5 and 10 percent of American goods worth $60 Billion.
China has asked to be equal to the US Nqumash, and the second largest economy in the world is less likely to fall in the near future.
To make Washington straight means to close it to the corner with its demands, but to bow openly to the US can be very embarrassing to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Nevertheless, researchers say that if Beijing can act intelligently, the stress of the U.S. trade - trade war can reap China for a long time by reducing the relation between the two parties.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that can cause economic problems in both countries is far more dangerous than those who have seen before," says Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a mental center.
Syria're ready for the return of refugees, says the Export Manager
Syria says she is willing to return to the refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country occupied by the war that lasted seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem says conditions in the world are improving.
"Today the situation in this is calm and safe because of the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to work against terrorist attacks in order to restore normal life.
All circumstances now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to a land in which they had to flee because of terrorism and the oppressive economic and social laws that have affected their everyday life and way of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled this country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the area need material assistance.
Al-Mulalem has said that the Syrian Empire would be happy to be helped to rebuild a country occupied by war.
But he stressed that they would not accept legitimate help or help from countries that advocate revolution.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won in 2018 the Ryder Cup by overthrowing the USA team with 16.5 - 10.5 points at Le Golf National except Paris, France.
The US has now been eaten six times in succession in Europe and has never won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again received the prize as the Danish captain team Thomas Bjorn reached the points they needed to conquer the United States.
The U.S. jil Mickelson, who has been heavily engaged in almost all this competition, puts his tee-shlot in water for the carr-3 hole of 16, his game was taken by Francesco Molinari.
Italian golf player Munari has played well in all his stages, 1 out of 4 to 5-0 since the format of the current competition began in 1997.
The American Jordan Spieth is released by 5&4 by the lowest player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, divided by 2 and 1 by English Ian Poulter, who may have been playing in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cups Forces, Spaniard Sergio Garcia won more victory than any other European contest by 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't control myself.
This has been a difficult year.
I thank Thomas that he would choose me and trust me.
I am very happy, and I am glad that we received the cup again.
We are working for the team. And I am happy that I was able to help," says Garcia after winning in Europe.
He passes the job to his fellow John Ram, who has broken the U.S. sloof, Tiger Woods on 2&1 playing alone on Sunday.
"I am very proud, by losing Tiger Woods, and growing up to look at," says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has been defeated in all four of his French games and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup record.
The strange figures of one of the most famous players in history, who has won the 14 major pieces, are second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has struggled all weekend to obtain fairways except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-satured golf courses during the whole contest.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk has spoken after a bad game of his team, "I’m proud of our players, they’ve worked.
There was a time in the morning when we had oppressed Europe.
We failed.
He has used Thomas.
He is the best captain.
All 12 players have played very well.
We will correct, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and continue.
I like these 12 players, and I am proud to be a captain.
You should offer advice to your captain.
We are separated.
Recent Red Tide: Numbers are being reduced in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
A new report from Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a decrease in Red Tide numbers in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, differences of output in the states of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Colliers - may indicate a decrease in numbers.
The production of Red Tide grows about 30 miles [30 km] off the coast from north Pinellas to south of the Lee regions.
Differences can be found in about 10 miles from the Hillsborough County coast, but in a few places more than in previous weeks.
Red Tide has also been seen in Pasco County.
Prices entering the area or off the Plain of Pinellas County have been reported in the previous summer, lower to the upper shore of the Hillsborough County, back to the highest figures of Manatee County, back to the upper or lower numbers of Sarasota County, and back to the mid-counters of the Charlotte County, back to the higher or lower figures of the Lee County.
Breathing disorders continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier areas.
Breathing disorders were not reported in Northwest Florida last week.
