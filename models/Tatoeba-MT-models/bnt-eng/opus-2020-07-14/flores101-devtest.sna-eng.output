Apart from the fields of sanna, it is hard for an animal to digest its acids in the form of plants that are found.
In addition, failure to do so can lead to serious problems, such as deep depression, malnutrition, and death.
Plantware may contain proteins found in leaves and beans, but this presents a challenge for such animals as we have to digest them other than a cooked reef.
